00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN:
We have all heard

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.126 align:middle line:84%
of the myths and the
legends of our history,

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:12.250 align:middle line:90%
but is there another story?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:84%
[THEME MUSIC] Host:
Erich von Daniken

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't know where
the gods came from.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
In antiquity, we had
connections between humans

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials,
and the humans

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
asked some of their gods,
where do you come from?

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They always pointed
to heaven, to the sky.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
In some cases,
they even expressed

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:84%
some name, some words, but
they mean nothing to us.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:10%
When you are in the
universe, and the universe

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:10%
is endless and gigantic,
and you would just

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:10%
be one intelligent society,
now you want to find out,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:10%
are we alone?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.775 align:middle line:90%
Are there others?

00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Now for example, you
send an electromagnetic

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:84%
signal out there and
ask, is somebody there?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 600 light years
away, there is somebody.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, your signal takes
600 years then it

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
took 600 back for an answer,
means before you get an answer,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:90%
1,200 years have come.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of communication
makes absolutely no sense.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
When you want to learn
about the universe--

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.585 align:middle line:90%
what is the universe?

00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:35.385 align:middle line:90%
How is it composed?

00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it expanding?

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
What is the spirit of
the universe-- then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
you need intelligent societies
in the whole universe.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to spread out
intelligence in short distance.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Now you can get in
contact with them.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we can ask on the next
solar system, which is maybe 4

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:90%
light years away, how are you?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you have contact with
others in the meantime?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence to spread
out intelligence

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is the meaning of
the so-called gods.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They have come here to
multiply intelligence.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
A part of every form of
intelligence is curiosity.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Without curiosity, you
have no development.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:90%
You are not intelligent.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So our curiosity
brings us to Mars.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It was curiosity-- the
question what's on moon?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
What's on the dark
side of the moon?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
What's on the back of the moon?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%
What is on Mars?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
It is always curiosity,
and the curiosity

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is a program which was made
by the extraterrestrials

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:90%
in our genes.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Because of curiosity,
we will spread out, too.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
We will go to Mars, but Mars
is only a starting point.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
We will go to other solar
systems sooner or later,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and we will find out
that the universe is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
full of intelligent forms
of lives, and many of them

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:90%
are similar to us.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
There might be that there are
forms of intelligence which

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
are completely
understandable to us.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:84%
You know I am a
man with fantasies.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And in my fantasy, I
could imagine maybe there

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
are something that's outside--

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
something like flying elephants.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The flying elephants would visit
planets with flying elephants.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:84%
This is logical,
which is forced.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:90%
You cannot change it.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Imagine we humans-- we would
be able to make space travel

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:90%
in bigger distance.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.499 align:middle line:90%
Where would we go?

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Our scientific community
would sit together

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and ask, where should we go?

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with our
own solar system.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Should we go to Jupiter?

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter is a giant.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter's gravity would
kill us immediately.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:10%
Should we go to Mercury?

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:10%
Mercury is close to the sun.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:10%
The planet's surface
is very, very hot--

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:10%
roughly 500 degrees
Celsius, et cetera.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:90%
What should we do on Mercury?

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Simply burn.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So we humans, we look before
we start for a planet which

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
has similar conditions
than the one

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
we are, because we
want to survive there.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:90%
We want to use our tools.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.209 align:middle line:84%
So we look before we
start, where do we go?

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
with extraterrestrials.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they came
from, their home planet

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
can not have been
completely different to us.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.060 align:middle line:84%
It must be a planet
similar to Earth,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
otherwise they could not have
survived here on this planet.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.830 align:middle line:84%
So the question where did they
come from, we cannot answer,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
but it must have been
an Earth-like planet.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, astronomers today
find daily, practically,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:84%
more planetary
systems, so we have

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.279 align:middle line:84%
to look which ones
are the closest to us.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Probably, they came from there.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
If ethnologists-- we
see it another tribe--

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
ethnologists try
to help the tribe,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
but they would not tell them
how to construct a weapon,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:90%
for example-- a rifle.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
They would not tell them
how to construct a car,

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:90%
because they have nothing.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:90%
They have no electricity.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:90%
They have no metal.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So all what they give is
curiosity and new genes,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:90%
which make them intelligent.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And the development
goes by itself.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Time doesn't matter
in the universe.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:90%
We had time now--

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.710 align:middle line:84%
3,000, 4,000 years-- to develop
our high technological society,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:90%
but that was not coincidence.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We had no other way, because
we have curiosity in us.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
We will recognize the
extraterrestrials,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.380 align:middle line:90%
because they are similar to us.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
They are, of
course, wiser to us.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Their technological standard is
much more advanced than ours,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
because if they would not
be much more advanced,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
they could never
have reached us.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
You know the distance between
the stars are measured in light

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
years, so if you don't
have the technology,

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:90%
you cannot reach it.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Even if they have
developed something

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
like over speed of light,
in our society we say,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:84%
according to Einstein, over
speed of light is not possible.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But with the big
distances, there

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
must be a way for
over speed of light.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:90%
They know it.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
They know the way
how to do it, so they

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.885 align:middle line:90%
are much more advanced than we.

00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
We will recognize them.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:90%
At the same time, they are wise.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:84%
You know these extraterrestrials
will have technology

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
to reach out distances
of light years.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:90%
They are not stupid, again.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:84%
These are not animal-like
beings who just reach

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:90%
the distances to kill others.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:90%
They are wise.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:90%
They are soft.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:90%
They are helpful.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They are understanding
to us, and not

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.599 align:middle line:84%
just animals who
are there to kill us

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
like we have it in some
science fiction pictures.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:10%
Professor Doctor John
Mack was a professor

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:10%
at Harvard University.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:10%
He has studied
extraterrestrial abductions.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew him.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
We have been together just
between us for quite some time.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, how
many extraterrestrials

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:90%
do exist out there?

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said, there are 100
thousands of different forms

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.580 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrials out there.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are humans.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And we probably
only get in contact

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
with the more or less human
form of extraterrestrials,

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
but there are 100 thousands
of different forms of them.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know it.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
A universe as vast
as our universe is

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
must have many, many
forms of intelligent life.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:90%
If not, you cannot contact them.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You have no possibility to talk
to them, to learn from them.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So you have to multiply
intelligence in the universe,

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:84%
and that was the purpose
why they have come here.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
We humans-- we have good
humans and bad humans.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We have intelligent
humans and stupid humans.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And why should it not be the
same way in the universe?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think the good guys
will win the situation

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:90%
against the bad guys.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:90%
The bad guys makes no sense.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Just to kill other people--

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.850 align:middle line:90%
it makes no sense.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:90%
We are not a nutrition.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:10%
They cannot eat us,
even if they wish.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
To do something, you can
just develop it somehow,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%
like we develop animals.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:10%
But it makes no sense--

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:10%
intelligent species
which travel the speed

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:10%
of light in big distances--

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.352 align:middle line:10%
in my personal opinion,
they are good guys.

00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:43.185 align:middle line:10%
They are benevolent.

00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:10%
We travel around our planet.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
We know all existing
cultures today.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are still
cultures which

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
are in the stage of Stone Age,
somewhere in the upper Amazon

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
River et cetera,
but none of them

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
are slaves of extraterrestrials.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:10%
Zecharia Sitchin, my
colleague who died--

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:10%
he was of the opinion in the
past, thousands of years ago,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:10%
the extraterrestrials
used us as slaves.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And it makes a certain
sense, because they used

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
our labor, our work, et cetera.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But today, I don't
see this anymore.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:90%
We would know it.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:90%
We know the cultures on Earth.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:90%
We have satellites all over.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:90%
We can visit all the cultures.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
None of them is enslaved
by extraterrestrials.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I had dreams where I
was visited by ETs,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and I was visiting some ETs,
and all these dreams were simply

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:90%
fantastic.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was
sleeping in the dream,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and then my sister
came into my room,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.210 align:middle line:84%
wakes me up, but
was all a dream.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Erich, come out immediately.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:90%
There are different UFOs.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
People are out
[INAUDIBLE] there.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And some strange beings
come out of these UFOs,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and no one understands them.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid of it.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:90%
So I went out of my bed--

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
all in dream-- and I was down,
and I was incredibly happy.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only one
who knew their language.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I could say to my humans,
hey, don't do nothing.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't shoot.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Just quiet down.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
I understand them.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:90%
It's my mother language.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We can talk together.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.800 align:middle line:90%
It was a wonderful dream.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
In another of these UFO
dreams, I was a pilot,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and I was a fighter pilot,
and I was shot down.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.000 align:middle line:90%
I was killed.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But at the same second,
I was in a room,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
which was not on
the planet Earth,

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:90%
and I felt very, very well.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And there were
beings around me who

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.760 align:middle line:84%
were speaking a
language which was not

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.940 align:middle line:84%
my Swiss German language,
but I understood everything.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the voices
said, he's back, again.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:90%
He's here.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:90%
We can hear him.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:90%
We can understand him.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And then another voice came
and said to me, very soft,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.670 align:middle line:90%
you have to go back again.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back
to your planet.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Your voyage, your
duty is not finished.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I wake up
in my bed, and I

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:84%
wish to continue that dream,
but it was just a dream.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
In my dreams, I
really think it was

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:90%
an other dimensional experience.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:90%
It was not just dream.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:90%
It was too realistic.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
I felt everything.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I smelled everything.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
beings touched me--

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
touched me with love, very soft.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:90%
It was not just a dream.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It was much more than this.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Every form of energy which
we feel or which talks to us

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
must be extraterrestrial,
because we have not

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:90%
developed this form of energy.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have a brain, and
we have a consciousness,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and we can sing, and
we can have fantasy,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but all this happens
in our brain.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we are able to
develop telepathy, which

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely understandable.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:84%
People can talk brain
to brain directly,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:90%
without using their mouths.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
This is everything possible.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.600 align:middle line:84%
It's my own imagination
which says to me,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:90%
there must be spiritual beings.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We are not the
crown of creation.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:90%
We are not the top of evolution.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
There must be much
more advanced,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
high intelligent beings
much more than we.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's simply my brain,
my logic who says this.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I was not influenced in this
kind of sort by religions.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Governments, including
religions, have no other way.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
They have to disclose
all that story.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Why do they have no other way?

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the
information is in us.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Our genetics will
find it out, and they

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:90%
will bring it to public.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Second, we have space
probes out there.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, some years ago
NASA has sent a space probe

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to the asteroid belt.
The asteroid belt

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:84%
is composed of 100
thousands of blocks.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are very
small, others are very big.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
The biggest of the
block is an asteroid

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:90%
with the name of Ceres.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:10%
Ceres has a diameter
of 930 kilometer--

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:10%
quite the big block.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:90%
We even speak of a small moon.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, the NASA probe has arrived
at Ceres, has surrounded Ceres,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
has sent wonderful pictures
to our planet Earth.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:84%
In high quality,
one of the picture

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.860 align:middle line:90%
shows rectangular in the ground.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:10%
Now again, we humans look for
the next reasonable scientific

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:10%
answer before we
go to speculations.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:10%
But more and more of these
pictures came to the Earth,

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle line:10%
and we clearly know there are
no intelligent beings up there.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:90%
There is no life up there.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But we find the
signs of rectangular.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Somebody must have
made it thousands

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of years ago in the past.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere must have been there.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Or our space probes
today are on Mars.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
They surround Mars.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
A small robot with the name of
Curiosity is rolling over Mars.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And again, we receive pictures
from the surface of the Mars,

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
pictures clearly

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.035 align:middle line:84%
show structures
which are not normal.

00:14:38.035 --> 00:14:41.262 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:41.262 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Again, we look for the
next plausible answer,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and sooner or later, we have
no more plausible answer.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We have religions, and we are
educated in our religions.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And now we learn that most
of these things are wrong,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:90%
so we lose our ground.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:90%
We lose our reason of life.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
We say, we have been
living here and praying,

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and we went to church, and
we were adoring some gods

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and making designs and
technology in the name of them,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and now we realize
it was not spiritual.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:90%
It was all extraterrestrials.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
They are technologically
ahead of us.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:90%
They simply visit us.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
We are the primitives
in their eyes.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
So we will lose a lot.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And a contact between
extraterrestrials and us--

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.610 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning,
would be a shock.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why, by the way,
they do it in a soft way,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:90%
with crop circles, et cetera.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They had the technology
to do it in a hard way,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.590 align:middle line:84%
but they do it in a soft
way and because they

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:90%
understand how we react.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So its reasonable, even from
the scientific community,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes even
for the government

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to go forward in a slow
way with that information--

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:90%
not just shock mankind.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this is one of
the reasons why I do my job.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I have many speeches
worldwide, and my lectures

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:90%
are quite impressive.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:90%
You see wonderful things.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
every speech, I

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
say to the audience, dear
ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
this is not a question
of believe it or not.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I will turn myself in my
tomb if some idiots came up

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and make a sort of
religion or sect

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:84%
of Erich von
Daniken's knowledge.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So why I am doing-- why
I am doing what I do?

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I want that mankind
see all this information

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
from the past from
an other angle,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
which brings us another
answer and another spirit

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:90%
That's my duty.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I want to change
the spirit of time.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Some of our scientists--

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I guess some of the astronomers,
some of the genetics--

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
they know already what is
going on, but they do not go

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to public, because their own
colleagues say, please don't.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:90%
You make us ridiculous.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You make our scientific
society ridiculous,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
because the people
will not believe you.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
We have to do it softly, step
by step, not just like a shock.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is the
feeling of the ETs, too.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Do it softly, not
shock the humans.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I met in my life
different people

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
from the scientific community or
from the military community who

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.420 align:middle line:84%
showed me and they expressed me
something, which I should not

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:90%
go to public, but I know it.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I have seen it.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.040 align:middle line:84%
This is why I am so
sure- so self-sure

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that I am sitting
on the right horse.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I know much more
than what I publish,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
because some things
should not be published.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago-- exactly
100 years ago in Fatima--

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Fatima is a little
village in Portugal.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
There, 70,000 people saw a UFO.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time, the church
could not say it's a UFO.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
They called it-- it was a
wonder, a miracle of the sun.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
When you go today to Fatima
and the gigantic cathedral--

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:84%
the cathedral dedicated to
the holy mother Virgin Mary,

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:84%
you see in glass painting
the miracle of the sun,

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of people
watching the sky.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, 100 years ago
that took place.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It started all on May 13th,
and it repeated for six months,

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:90%
and it ended on October 13.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, one of the girl--

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
her name was Lucia,
she received a message.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And the message she
should give to the highest

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:84%
commander on this planet,
not to the King of Portugal.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:10%
The message went to
the holy Pope in Rome.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:10%
It was Benedict the 15th.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:10%
So the child, Lucia,
later went into a convent.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.940 align:middle line:90%
She became a nun.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And she give the
message to the Pope

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
with the order to publish
this message to mankind

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:90%
on October 13, 1960--

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:90%
43 years after 1917.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The Pope, 1960,
read the message.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Many journalists were around
it, and the newspapers of 1960

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
said the Pope answered, I
can not publish this message.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It would create a
panic among humans.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, my god, if
the message would

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
come from the real mother Virgin
Mary, she knows what she does.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Pope say, I
can not publish it.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It would create a panic.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because of this
answer, journalists

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:90%
start a big speculation.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.585 align:middle line:84%
They said, maybe the message has
to do with the next World War,

00:20:33.585 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
with the third World War.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
We will all be
destroyed, et cetera.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So they went-- journalists
went to the Bishop of Leiria.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Leiria is the next biggest
city to the village of Fatima,

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and the bishop was
living in Leiria.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And they asked the bishop,
does this message from Fatima

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:84%
has something to do
with the next World War,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
with rockets, Pershing,
SS-20, and so on?

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And the bishop, who knew
the message, says no.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It has absolutely nothing to
do with the next World War,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
with the destruction of mankind.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It concerns our belief.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it concerns our
belief, why should they

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.650 align:middle line:90%
not publish it?

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Mother Mary was the one who
gave order to publish it,

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Catholic church
doesn't publish it.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, it was a
message from extraterrestrials.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials-- in 1917,
they surrounded our planet.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
They realized in 1917 mankind
had no advanced technology

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
for a message going
around the world.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
There were no
satellites in 1917.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
There were no television
in 1917, et cetera.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So they simply calculated
give them another 40 years,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:90%
and then they will be ready.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
In this message, probably--
and now I have to speculate.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Probably it said,
well, welcome humans.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Greetings to you, humans.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid of us.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.960 align:middle line:84%
You are not alone
in the universe.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
There are many other
societies in the universe.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
We were here thousands
of years ago.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We will visit you
again, et cetera.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
We will come back in the
next decades, and so on.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, between 1917 and
1960, 43 years have passed,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and Fatima has become
a pilgrim place.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:10%
Gigantic cathedral is in Fatima.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.280 align:middle line:10%
Millions of believers pray
to the Holy Virgin Mary.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.880 align:middle line:10%
And now in 1960, the Pope
realized this message--

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:10%
it was not the Holy Virgin Mary.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why he said,
I cannot publish it.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It would create a panic.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, speculations
come up, has it

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:90%
to do with the next World War?

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the bishop of
Leiria said, no.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with the next World War.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
It concerns our belief.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because it was the
extraterrestrials, and not

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:90%
the mother Mary.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, 100 years have passed.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
This year I expect maybe
that they show up again.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They show us again what
in 1917 they believed

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:90%
it's a miracle of the sun.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was not a
miracle of the sun.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It was an extraterrestrial
spaceship.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
They gave us 100 years of time,
and they will show up again--

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I hope, at least.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:90%
This is my wish, my dream.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:84%
All the popes since
1960 know the message.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
None of them has opened
it to the public--

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:90%
none of them.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
There are speculations--
all kinds of speculations.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I studied this very carefully.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The speculations
contradict each other.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.715 align:middle line:84%
Some of the popes are really
telling lies concerning Fatima.

00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:52.916 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:52.916 --> 00:24:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:10%
I was one of these figures,
which already 30 years ago was

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:10%
in Colorado in the mountain
called Space command.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
I was one of there.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:10%
At that time, it
was a secret visit,

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:10%
and I saw they observed
everything around the Earth--

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:10%
everything.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:10%
They said, you see, this is
exactly the Soyuz satellite--

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:10%
whatever numbers it, and said,
well, this is calculators.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly now over America,
and every position there.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I ask
them about UFOs.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever, with your
observations, seen UFO?

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.754 align:middle line:90%
They said, of course.

00:24:39.754 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to it?

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:90%
That we can say nothing.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:90%
They are too fast.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Their speed is so
incredible, and they

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
make some maneuvers--
rectangular maneuvers,

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:90%
which we can not imitate.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So we know for sure it's
something different,

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have
to be afraid of it.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in Space Command,
here in the Cheyenne Mountain

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
here, they know it, but
they don't go to public.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Other dimensional
beings might well exist.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
My knowledge is too
poor to understand this.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, my fantasy

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
accepts gigantic
distances to beings

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
which have no more body, which
just exist in a spiritual way.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely possible.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
It could even be that in our
evolution some 100,000 years

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.270 align:middle line:84%
in the future, we do not
need our body anymore,

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.680 align:middle line:84%
because we don't need to be
feeded anymore and to drink

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So we leave our body, and we
become spiritual intelligences.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I think this makes a certain
sense, at least in my dreams.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:58.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.050 --> 00:25:59.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm Erich von Daniken.

"Beyond the Legends."
