>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: We
have all heard of the myths

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.210 align:middle line:90%
and the legends of our history.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.252 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
The Maya is a cultural group
living in Central America.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Mayans, of course,
have their mythologies

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:84%
about the gods that
visited from outer space.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:10%
The oldest Mayan city, to
our knowledge, is Tikal.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:10%
Tikal is in today's Guatemala.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And Tikal was probably
founded 1,000 years BC.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Just remember, ancient Rome
in Europe was founded 700 BC.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So this Tikal city of the Maya
is even older than ancient Rome

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.440 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And that Tikal lays on a place
where nobody understands why.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, when a
tribe is traveling,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and when they
decide to construct

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:84%
a city with some
pyramids and temples,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
they always settle on a
place where there's water,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:90%
because humans need water--

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
water for drinking,
water for working,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
water for the
construction, et cetera.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:10%
But in Tikal,
there is no water--

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:10%
absolutely no river,
no creek, nothing.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The next water is a lake,
the Peten Itza, see,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:90%
about 40 kilometers away.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But the question first is,
why did the tribe of Maya

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
decide to settle down on
a place and to construct

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:84%
their biggest, oldest city
on a place without water?

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.920 align:middle line:90%
What is the reason for it?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And here, I have some idea.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
In our time, we have many
so-called pilgrim places,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
especially in the
Catholic religion--

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
for example, Fatima
in Portugal or Lourde

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
in France or
Guadalupe in Mexico.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:90%
These are holy places.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Because always someone from
out there, mostly Mother Mary,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
descended.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And children said,
they were here.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%
I saw them here exactly.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So the place becomes
a holy place.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And the people decide to
make their construction,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:84%
their church, on that place
where they had their vision.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Now in Tikal, archaeologists
found a little inscription

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
in Maya language.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Here the gods
from heaven descended."

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Which gods?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So I asked myself, was it like
today in our pilgrim places?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They constructed Tikal
because there, some time,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
a god descended, not
because they had no water.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I said, the nearest water is the
lake Peten, 40 kilometers away.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So they had to make
artificial water drains.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So the water, they
come to Tikal.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
In Tikal we have more than
60 pyramids, most of them

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:90%
are orientated archaeologically.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:84%
The biggest pyramid still
today is open for tourists.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
You can look up
there to the sky.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what
for these pyramids were.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Normally, we say, for
example, in Egypt,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids were made because
they were tombs for the gods

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
or for the pharaohs,
but not in Tikal.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
No tombs were found,
no graves, nothing.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:90%
So we don't understand.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
You say, maybe they used to
construct high pyramids just

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to overlook the
forest, the jungle.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But they can be
connected with the stars.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But why then so many pyramids,
60 of it in one place?

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Why not only two or three?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't have the answer for it.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
In Tikal, for example,
we have many stelaes.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Stelaes are stone blocks, mostly
about two and a half meter

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:84%
high, with engravings
and chiselings on it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.886 align:middle line:90%

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of these stelaes shows
the first and the oldest god.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You see some human being,
their head is cut off.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.280 align:middle line:90%
You don't see the head.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But you see the chest, two
hands, and he's holding

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:90%
something between his fingers.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you see his
legs and his shoes.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the Mayans
had no shoes at all.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:90%
They had naked feet or sandals.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But these kind of shoes
look like the shoes

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:90%
of an extraterrestrial.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the center you
see something going down

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
like a spiral, making a
curve, going into a basket

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:90%
or into a box.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So probably they represented,
in that way, the oldest god,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:90%
who descended to them in Tikal.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the next cities
of Tikal is Tulum.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Tulum is located on
the Caribbean Sea.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And the city of Tulum was just
honored to the descending gods.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:10%
Every temple in Tulum shows
a descending god, which means

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:10%
in practice, you see a stone.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You see something, some human
beings had a head in front.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Then their legs,
spread legs, they

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
are lying on something
like a bobsled.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
They are descending
from the heavens.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Today, archaeologists
call these descending

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
gods the gods of the bees.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:84%
But every normal
being had nothing

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to do with bees, especially
the whole city of Tulum

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:90%
is dedicated to descending gods.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And you see these figures
who came down from heaven,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
often with wings on,
with technological stuff

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.680 align:middle line:90%
in their hands.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
You see them only
also in Chichen Itza

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:90%
and in other Maya places.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Whole Maya land was
dedicated to the god.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the most known god of
the Maya was Quetzalcoatl.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:90%
And Quetzalcoatl was described.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:10%
He was coming from
the morning star.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:90%
He teached the human.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
He teached them in astronomy
and other belongings,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
including construction
of buildings.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And before he left, Kukulkan
promised to return one day.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, Kukulkan, Quetzalcoatl--
it's all the same figure,

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
just with different names.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
In the lower land, the
Mayans called him Kukulkan.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
In the higher lands, they
called him Quetzalcoatl.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.935 align:middle line:10%
It's always the same figure.

00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Our archaeologists
today, because they

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
don't believe in
extraterrestrials,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to have
to do with some humans

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
or human-like figures descending
as teachers from heaven.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
They call these
descending gods the bees.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, a
bee is an insect.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
The gods which are
chiseled in stone in Tulum,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:84%
in Chichen Itza, have
nothing to do with bees.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And you see descending
human-like beings

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
with some kind technical
apparatus in their hands.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But archaeologists call
it the descending bees,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.060 align:middle line:84%
which in my opinion is
absolutely ridiculous.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:90%
It had nothing to do with bees.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Our archaeologists will have
to change their minds sooner

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:90%
or later.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.334 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:51.334 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Tikal is in today's Guatemala.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Guatemala has, of course, a
museum, like every capital.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:10%
And in the Museum
of Guatemala, you'll

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:10%
find different gods, heads
of the gods with helmets

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.980 align:middle line:10%
on, sometimes with the
apparatuses on their noses,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.057 align:middle line:10%
because they had an artificial
breathing, et cetera.

00:08:38.057 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I know the old mythologists.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
mythologists speak

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:90%
about the gods who descended.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And they did not
breathe like humans.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, Abraham, in
the Abraham epigraphic,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
he makes contact with
two extraterrestrials.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said they did
not breathe like humans.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Now in Tikal, we find
some of these heads.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Not only in Tikal,
also in Chichen Itza.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And they had some artificial
breathing apparatuses

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:90%
before their noses.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I think they must have
used some kind of filter

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
against our bacteria and
viruses on our planet.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
While the technology
compared to Egypt

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
is partly primitive,
in Egypt, the pyramids

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
were constructed out of big
blocks, huge blocks, sometimes

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:84%
two and a half
tons or even more.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But in Central America,
including in Tikal,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids are constructed
out of small blocks, just piece

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:90%
by piece.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So it was not a very
high advanced technology.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But in Egypt, for
example, on the pyramid,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
there are no
sculptures, no writings.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is chiseled on
the wall of the pyramids.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.070 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids in
Central America, they

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
are full with chiselings
which represent [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:90%
of their descending gods.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.570 align:middle line:84%
This is something
absolutely sensational,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid of Chichen Itza.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I suggest every tourist,
when you come to Mexico,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:90%
visit Chichen Itza.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
chance, be there

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
in the early morning
of March 21st.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:84%
You see, the pyramid
of Chichen Itza

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
is constructed of
nine different steps.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a step pyramid, one
step smaller to the other.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:10%
And the pyramid is
located in a way,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:10%
astronomically, that every
21st of March, some miracle

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.950 align:middle line:10%
happens there.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:90%
You see the sun is going up.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
construction of the 9 steps,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
because of the
astronomical orientation,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
you see a god or a snake
composed of light and shadow,

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
going slowly down the
step, slowly down.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.606 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
on the staircase,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
left and right, is the so-called
winged snake, the flying snake.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So you see on 21st of
March in the early morning,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
you see light and
shadow, light and shadow,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:84%
slowly going down
the stairways exactly

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the winged snake.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And on the 21st of September,
you see the opposite.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:84%
This time, when
the sun goes down,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
the light and shadow
climbs up the stairs

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and finally disappears.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
The situation which
they have shown,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
the Maya constructors in their
astronomy, is sensational.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:84%
They prove in the
building, in the pyramid,

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:90%
some god descended.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
He was teaching the
humans for a few years.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And he disappeared
again, with the promise

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:90%
to return in a faraway future.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Chichen Itza is an absolute must
for every tourist in Mexico.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:10%
The Maya adored the gods
Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:10%
which is the same,
just a different name.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And Quetzalcoatl or
Kukulkan was always

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
represented as a
snake with wings.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:10%
Now the Maya were
natural people.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the
snake cannot fly.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Why do they show a
snake with wings?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I suggest because
they saw, in the sky,

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:90%
they saw some flying machines.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And they looked like a snake.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:90%
It was a little long.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:10%
And a snake can fly, so
they put wings on it.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why Quetzalcoatl
the god or Kukulkan

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
the god is represented in the
Maya temple, in the sculpture,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:90%
as a winged snake.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors, including
the Maya in Central America,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:84%
their first religion
was natural religions.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid of the
nature of the lightening,

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
of the thundering,
of the earthquake

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
or the volcanic
eruptions, et cetera.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:90%
But then the gods descended.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
In Maya land,
Quetzalcoatl or Kukulkan

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
represented as a winged god.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference between
Quetzalcoatl, Kukulkan,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
the winged god and the
natural catastrophes,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.053 align:middle line:84%
like the earthquake, the
lightning coming down?

00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:18.825 align:middle line:90%
They were teachers.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The gods who descended
from the sky,

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.435 align:middle line:84%
they teach, they learned the
Maya about their calendar.

00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The Maya have a
fantastic calendar,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:84%
one of the most fantastic
calendars in the world.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And it all is
related to the gods.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:90%
[DRUMMING]

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, every culture
has a calendar.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And every calendar
has a starting date.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, we live in
the Christian culture.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Our starting date is the
birth of Jesus Christ.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But the Muslim society
has another calendar.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And the Muslim calendar starts
when the prophet Muhammad

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:90%
went to Mecca, about 700 AD.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So the Jewish tradition
has another calendar.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
At the starting
point of the calendar

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
must always be something
important for the culture.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish calendar
started about 5300 BC.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was it was
the creating of the world,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
of our planet.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Now the Maya also had
a special calendar.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And the Mayan calendar
started 3114 BC.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the Mayans,
according to our archeology,

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:90%
did not even exist.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So they must have taken
their starting date

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:84%
from their ancestors,
whoever it was.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has it to
do with the gods?

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Maya
stop their calendar

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:90%
on the August 14th, 3114 BC?

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Later, about 450 years
ago, the Spanish conquerors

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:90%
came to Central America.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish conquerors
found hundreds and hundreds

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:90%
of Maya writings.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.835 align:middle line:10%
They destroyed them all.

00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:10%
They killed the high priests.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
They even killed the students.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
They destroyed all the writings
of the Maya, except three.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Three Maya writings survived.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
They are today in Dresden.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Dresden is a city in Germany.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They are today in
Madrid and in Paris.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we are not even able to
read these Maya writings.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:10%
But the Dresden codex--

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:10%
so that's how it is called--

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:10%
speaks about the Maya calendar.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:10%
And we can read the figures.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:10%
Definitely we can read them.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.370 align:middle line:10%
And in the Dresden
codex we learn

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:47.404 align:middle line:10%
that the Maya calendar started
on August 14th, 3114 BC.

00:16:47.404 --> 00:16:49.834 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, all these writings
have been destroyed.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine we would
have a war in nowadays.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And an adversary would
destroy all the Bibles.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But the priests, the
Christian priests, they

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
know what's written
in the Bible.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:90%
They know it in their head.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So they start to
rewrite the Bible.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
in Central America.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.670 align:middle line:84%
After the destruction
of all these writings,

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the priests sat down
in secret places,

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:84%
and they rewrote
the old stories.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:31.345 align:middle line:84%
These are so-called the Mexican
handwritings, or the Chilam

00:17:31.345 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Balam books, they are called.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And there, in the fifth Chilam
Balam book, one of the priests

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
explains why they started their
calendar on August 14, 3114

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
BC, because this was the day
when the gods from heaven

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:90%
descended.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:84%
That was the important
moment for the beginning

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Maya calendar.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The Maya calendar has,
in fact, an ending date.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And ending date was
calculated some years

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.290 align:middle line:84%
ago for the year 2012,
transferred into our calendar.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And they said on that date,
the world will disappear,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:90%
the world will collapse.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, nowhere, in no
one Maya handwriting,

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
it is written that the
world will collapse around

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:90%
the end of the Maya date.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But what, in fact, they
say is true, on that day,

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.730 align:middle line:84%
the gods will return from
heaven to earth again.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:90%
Now the year 2012 passed by.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And there were no
extraterrestrials returning.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:90%
So what is the mistake?

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
The problem is to
translate the Maya calendar

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:90%
into our Christian calendar.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
You see, we say today, 2017
years ago, Jesus Christ

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:90%
was born.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And there, we
started our calendar.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
this is not true.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Jesus Christ may have been
born 20 years earlier or later.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the exact date
of the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:84%
We just fixed a date
which is not correct.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we translate
the Maya calendar

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
into a Christian
calendar, we still

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
have this problem of
translating the dates.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So the Maya calendar
ends and says,

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:90%
then the gods will return.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
This might be every day,
practically today, tomorrow,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.846 align:middle line:90%
or in the next 15 years.

00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:24.702 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:29.175 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Palenque is the one
sensation among the Maya.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would say Palenque is
the one sensation concerning

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of
extraterrestrials.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:10%
In 1949, the Mexican
archaeologist Professor Ruz

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:10%
discovered on the
temple of inscription.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But the temple of inscription
is, in reality, a pyramid.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:84%
It is carved a
groove up at the top.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
And then they found a shaft.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Inside the shaft, a stairway,
staircase going down.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:90%
It went down under the pyramid.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But the staircase in that time,
in 1949, was full of big stone.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:10%
So it took three years to
dig out all these stones.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:84%
In 1952, Professor Dr. Ruz,
with his students in archeology,

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
they stand before a
big door in the form,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of a triangle.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.290 align:middle line:84%
They never found a door in
the shape of a triangle.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:90%
The door was broken up.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And Professor Ruz, with
his candles and his light,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%
looked into a room.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And the first words he said,
I don't believe my eyes.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:90%
I seen a sort of chapel.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And from the ceiling down are
hanging things like candles.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
In reality, they were
not just candles.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It was stalactites
and stalagmites.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So the room is
seven meters long.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And on the bottom, there was
a big plate with big, I mean,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
3.80 meter long, 2.20
meter large, one block,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.415 align:middle line:84%
one monolith-- and
on this monolith,

00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:90%
an incredible chiseling.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:90%
You see something like a frame.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the center
of the frame, there

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
is a young man sitting,
bending forward, almost

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:90%
like a motor-racing cyclist.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
He uses his two hands
to manipulate controls.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
You see it clearly
in the picture.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And he is sitting on a chair.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Directly on his nose is some
kind of apparatus, maybe

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:90%
some oxygen apparatus.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting on a chair.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
The heel of his left foot
is on a sort of pedal.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:84%
The chair is separated
from the back of him.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And just behind,
outside the frame,

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
you see something like a linking
flame coming out of there.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Now this is optically,
absolutely convincing

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
for every normal
human being, but not

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
for the groups of
archaeologists.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we live in
a reasonable society.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And our science always looks
for the next reasonable answer

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
before they go into
speculation, which is normal;

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.810 align:middle line:90%
which makes sense.

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:10%
Around this stone plate,
there was an inscription.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And only a few words
they could decipher.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:90%
For example, the word Pakal.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And they knew Pakal was
the second last ruler

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of the city of Palenque.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So they said, this man
sitting in this frame inside,

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:90%
he represents Pakal.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, he is not
sitting in a frame.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The frame, in reality,
shows the open mouths

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:90%
of a mythological monster.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So what I look as
frame is just the teeth

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:90%
of the mythological monster.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's falling into the mouth
of this mythological monster.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But out of his chest,
you see the living tree,

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.129 align:middle line:90%
or the tree of life, et cetera.

00:22:49.129 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I explained is
something like a linking flame

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
coming out at the end.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists said
no, these are just

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.330 align:middle line:84%
the stylized hairs of the
beard of the weather god.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
archaeological suggestion

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
when they found this
tombstone of Palenque in 1952.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, from
1952 until today,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I have read in the
scientific literature

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
14 different explanations
what this should mean.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
It is always Pakal,
that's for sure--

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Pakal, the second last ruler.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:10%
And now, just a few years ago,
the two leading epigraphers--

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:10%
epigraphers are the
people, the professors,

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:10%
who are able to read
the Maya language--

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:10%
Professor Dr. George
Stuart and Stuart--

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.260 align:middle line:10%
of course, it's the father
and son, Stuart and Stuart.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And they know everything now in
Maya graphics, in Maya writing.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And they say, yes, it is Pakal.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But Pakal is not falling
into the open mouth

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:90%
of a mythological monster.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with a
cross of life or tree of life.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Every little thing which
is chiseled in the stone

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the universe.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:10%
Pakal is, in fact,
leaving the earth,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:10%
flying out to the universe.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.254 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:15.254 --> 00:24:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So the tombstone of
Palenque is still

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:84%
there in the original
pyramid, because it's too big.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:90%
They cannot put it out.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Normally, pyramids
were not tombs.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:84%
But the so-called Temple
of Inscription in Palenque,

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:84%
which is a pyramid,
was, in fact, a tomb.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Under this tombstone
there was a grave.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And they found a skeleton.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.540 align:middle line:90%
The skeleton had a mask.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It's probably Pakal, Pakal, the
second last ruler of Palenque.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:90%
But what we do not understand--

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
the normal Maya, their size, was
about 1 meter 50 to 1 meter 60.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And that skeleton in there
of Pakal is 1 meter 81.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:90%
He's too big for a Maya.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, 1 meter
81 is not Maya-like.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And also, his nose is not human,
because the bone of his nose

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:84%
starts already on
his front up there.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So we say it's Pakal, but
nobody is sure if it's Pakal.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Now concerning the
stalactites and stalagmites.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Soon, as a pyramid
is somehow broken,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and the rain goes
into the pyramid,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:84%
some stalactites and
stalagmites start to form.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:90%
But this takes an eternity.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They found seven meter long
stalactites and stalagmites

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
in this room, which is
situated under the pyramid.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget this.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Because of the stalactites,
you could measure or calculate

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:90%
how old is this room.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It does not fit to the Maya.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The Maya is a relatively
young society.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And Palenque is more or less
about 800 AD, so after Christ.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not very old.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.389 align:middle line:84%
Others say even younger,
they say 1400 after Christ.

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But it does not fit together
with the stalactites

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and stalagmites.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:84%
First, we had this
tomb down in the earth.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
This tomb was covered
by this large tombstone

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
with the chiseling of Pakal.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And later, early
on, they started

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.952 align:middle line:84%
to construct the
pyramid over the tomb.

00:26:49.952 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
The tomb is much older
than the pyramid itself.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.235 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:54.235 --> 00:26:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that first there
was a tomb, tomb down

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
with the holy figure, one of the
gods, or a mixture of the gods,

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:90%
or an imitation of the gods.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And they chiseled this into
this gigantic tombstone.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was there, a
holy place for the Maya,

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
or the people who
lived before the Maya,

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.510 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And only later, because
it was a holy place, now

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.200 align:middle line:84%
they started to construct a
pyramid, the so-called temple

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:84%
of inscription,
over the old tomb.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So in my suggestion, the tomb
is probably 5,000 years old,

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:84%
because of the stalactites
and stalagmites.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And the temple itself,
the temple of inscription,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:84%
is young, let's say
maybe 1,500 years old.

Every Maya city, be it
Tikal, be it Chichen Itza,

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:90%
They show the descending gods.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:84%
All these Maya cities are
dedicated to the gods.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And the gods were the
teachers from heaven.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:90%
They worshipped them.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And they always waited for
the return of the gods,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because the gods promised
we will return one day.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:10%
I know from
different mythologies

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:10%
that the so-called gods,
the extraterrestrials,

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:10%
had sexual contact with humans.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Now concerning Maya culture,
I told all the Maya writings

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:90%
were destroyed.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And later, the priests
rewrote their old knowledge.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
In all this
knowledge, nothing is

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:84%
written that there
was a sexual contact

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
between the so-called
gods and the humans.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.354 align:middle line:90%
Not in the Maya world.

00:28:53.354 --> 00:28:54.770 align:middle line:84%
In other places
of the world, yes.

We all are descendants
of the gods.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
We have writings which say
that Noah, our progenitor

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:84%
father which survived the
flood, was the product

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:90%
of an artificial mutation.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we all are
offspring of Noah.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So we all have
extraterrestrial genes in us.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans knew that the
gods, when they descended,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans knew that the gods
were the teachers, because they

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:90%
learned the astronomy.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And they had a
fantastic astronomy.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
The Maya knew, for example,
the astronomy, the surrounding

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of Venus around the sun, so
precise that, in 6,000 years,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
there's only a difference
of about one hour.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So the teachers from heaven
were the extraterrestrials.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:90%
They knew this.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Now every Maya city was
constructed for the gods.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And in every Maya city,
doesn't matter where you are,

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:84%
you see these heads,
these helmets.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:90%
You see these beings.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they have
boxes on their chest.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They use their 10 fingers
to manipulate some controls,

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:90%
some knots on the box.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.519 align:middle line:90%
So it's imitating technology.

Maya land is full
with these things.

The question is clear.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:90%
The gods were extraterrestrials.
