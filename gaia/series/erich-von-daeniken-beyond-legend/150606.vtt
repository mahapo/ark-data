>> We have all heard of
the myths and the legends

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.710 align:middle line:90%
of our history.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.070 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.982 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Our forefathers were
Stone Age people.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they adored the sky.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
They saw the little
lights up there,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:84%
but they could not
understand the little lights.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
For them, it was a
mystery, and there

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
were different shapes of lights,
and they had different colors.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:90%
That's how astronomy started.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Humans could not understand
what was going up there.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they realized
that, throughout the years,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
the situation in the
sky would change.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized
also, after one year,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
it restarts again, the
same continuation up there.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So the oldest astronomy
was miraculous,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and the oldest religions,
probably, were not religions.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.510 align:middle line:90%
They adored the moon.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
They could not
understand the sun.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
They could not know
what is a lightning

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and that it turned out
that thundering behind it.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They could not understand
how all this fits together.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But then all of a sudden,
the heavens opened,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and some beings from
outer space descended.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
first teachers.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And now the teachers taught
the humans about astronomy.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
They teached them about
the connections up there.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.607 align:middle line:90%

00:01:41.607 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So what the oldest monument
in astronomy is, nobody knows.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But one of the oldest
of them is definitively

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Newgrange in Ireland.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And we still don't
understand how it is made

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.620 align:middle line:90%
and what purpose it was.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But built on
Newgrange is a dolmen.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.900 align:middle line:84%
Dolmen means it is a
hill, and that the hill

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
was made artificially
by Stone Age people.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
Now, they must have known
a lot about astronomy,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
because they made a
special hole in this dolmen

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:90%
in the passage way.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And only on June 21,
the sun entered exactly

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
in this opening in
this passageway,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and went through the
dolmen, and lighted

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%
a stone which was in the back.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole dolmen
was brilliant in light.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Light was shooting all
over like laser beams.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was done for
astronomy, because it's always

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:90%
on the June 21.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.980 align:middle line:90%
We have no answer.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Who made it?

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
With what astronomical
knowledge?

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:90%
Why did they make what they did?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
There are so many questions
open which nobody knows.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.002 align:middle line:90%

00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge is another mystery.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You see, according to
official archeology,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge was constructed
in three different epochs.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
The oldest one should
be about 2800 BC,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and then some 800 years later,
they made the second part.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:90%
And later again, the third part.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
archaeologists

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
found out that Stonehenge
is, in reality, much older

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:90%
than 2800 BC.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:90%
It must go far back.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how far.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Our problem is,
about Stonehenge, we

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:84%
have many, many theories;
different ideas what it was.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But one thing can be
clearly demonstrated.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
You see, Stonehenge is composed
of different rings of stone.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, these rings have
a certain distance

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:84%
between one ring
and the next ring,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
and these distances
of the rings are

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the same as the distances of
the planets in our solar system.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You see, in our solar system,
in the center, we have the sun.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The next planet
which orbits the sun

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is Mercury, then comes
Venus, then comes the Earth,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:90%
then comes Mars, then Jupiter.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Between Mars and
Jupiter is a big lake.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The same situation
happened with Stonehenge,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:90%
and you can demonstrate this.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:84%
You see, there's one ring for
Mercury, one ring for Venus,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
one ring for the Earth,
then one ring for Mars.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Between Mars and
Jupiter is a big lake.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And far away, out of the
rings, is the biggest stone,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
called the Heel Stone.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:90%
It stands for Jupiter.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
A big stone, because
Jupiter is the biggest

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:90%
planet in our solar system.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, if this is
not coincidence,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
then some teachers
must have told this

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:90%
to our Stone Age people.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, they
could have known nothing

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
about the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
You need a powerful telescope to
realize that there is something

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:90%
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But Stonehenge,
all the rings, they

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.564 align:middle line:84%
have the same shape as the
planets in our solar system.

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
things outside of Europe.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, for
example, I was in Colombia.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
In Colombia, there
is, in the jungle,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:90%
a so-called sacred city.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:90%
The name is Buritaca.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
They call it Buritaca-Doscientos
because there

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:90%
are 200 small rivers.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:90%
And "doscientos" means 200.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So Buritaca-Doscientos,
they call

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:90%
it the Lost City in the jungle.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And this city is composed
of several terraces,

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:90%
like pyramids.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
One terrace is smaller,
composed on the older ones.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up to
different forms and shapes,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and on these terraces,
some building,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:84%
not stone building,
normal houses

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
made out of wood and
straw were constructed.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But these houses were
orientated, again,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:90%
astronomically.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
is one house which

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.125 align:middle line:90%
they call the House of the Man.

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
There is another
house which they

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:90%
call the House of the Woman.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, from the House
of the Man, there

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
is a pillar going
up from the ceiling.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And from the House of the Woman,
there are two crossed pillars.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, exactly on
March 21, the sun

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
rises up and makes a shadow
exactly on the pillar

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:84%
of the man's house, which
crosses the two, let's

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:90%
say legs, of the woman.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Which means, symbolically,
it's springtime,

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
you have to put the
seed into the earth.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.930 align:middle line:90%
But it all works by astronomy.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
They were sure that the whole
universe has to do with gods.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the natives there,
they are called the Koguis.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Koguis had their
teacher from heaven.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The teacher told them
the important things

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:90%
about astronomy.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And not only this,
the teachers also

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
told them about
the coming flood.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Like in the Bible,
they told them,

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.810 align:middle line:84%
you must construct a ship to be
saved before the Great Flood.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, in all these cases,
constructing a ship,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
be it in the Bible, Noah; be it
the Kogui up there in Colombia,

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
which is far away from
the biblical stories,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in all these cases,
it was not just

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
a miraculous god who, by shake
hand or making this, here

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
is a ship.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So like a miracle, now,
they always used technology.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Constructing a
ship is technology,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and constructing a ship
means you need some time.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not the story
of the Great Flood,

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
but simply, somebody
told them it is coming.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
They knew in advance, and at
least one year in advance,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
if not more, that the
Great Flood would come.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you have no
time to construct a ship.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So who were these beings
who knew in advance

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
that the gigantic
flood would arrive?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Here again, we end
with extraterrestrials.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They had the knowledge
seen from outer space.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:90%
They knew what was coming.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:84%
They knew, for
example, it is possible

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that the pole would change,
the magnetic pole would change.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:90%
They knew it in advance.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why they give some
of the human group time

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:90%
to construct a ship.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In old Sumeria, there is
the so-called King's List.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The King's List is, today, in
the British Museum in London.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:84%
There you can read the oldest
kings before the Great Flood.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the flood comes,
and the King's List

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:84%
says that, after the flood,
the gods descended again

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
from the sky to the human.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The same situation
we had in Colombia,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
these Kogui, if we'd seen it
from a technical point of view,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:90%
they would be primitive.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
These Kogui knew
about the Great Flood.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
They constructed the ship, and
again, in the Kogui mythology,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
they say after the
water disappeared,

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
the gods descended again from
the sky, the same situation

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
like in the Sumerian legend.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I have studied so many
myths and legends,

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and practically
every old culture

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
knows about the flood,
including the Maya, for example.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Or you go to Greek mythology,
there you have Plato.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And Plato speaks about the
Great Flood which was coming.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, Plato had no
contact with the Maya.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
The Maya were living
in Central America.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And they all have
the same stories,

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:90%
because it was a Great Flood.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And all, they have
the same story, saying

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that a god was coming from
the sky, was wanting them,

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
give them time to
construct a ship.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And after the flood, when
the water disappeared,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
the gods descended
again from the sky.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.522 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:14.522 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Humans, some thousands
of years ago,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
they were teached by
extraterrestrials.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
told them, please

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
make this monument
astronomically.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Most of the dolmen,
in French Brittany,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, they are all
orientated astronomically.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, they said,
well, it's just the tombstones.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So they tried to
find some graves.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:90%
They found nothing.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.215 align:middle line:84%
Then a few years ago,
for the first time,

00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
a helicopter over flew
this megalithic place

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:90%
in French Brittany.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And later, they realized that
all these stone lines were not

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
standing there by coincidence.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
They always measured the
same distance, 2,860 meters

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:90%
or exactly half of it.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
all was composed

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
of different triangles,
but Pythagorean triangle.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, Pythagoras was a
Greek mathematician.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:84%
He was living in Greece
roughly 400 or 500 BC.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But all these stones
in French Brittany

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:90%
are at least 5,000 years old.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So Pythagoras had
nothing to do with it.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:90%
All is linked with astronomy.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Here we came to the
question, of course,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors had no idea
of Pythagorean triangle.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Why have they done it?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They admired their so-called
gods, the teachers,

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we want to
do something in your honor.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers said,
OK, please bring stones.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they learned them
how they could move stones

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:90%
in an easier way.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said, but you have
to put these stones exactly

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:90%
in that line we tell you.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The Stone Age people did it,
not the extraterrestrials.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
We did the dirty work.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They did it, but they did not
realize that the outcome of it

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
were Pythagorean
triangles, or always

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the same distance or
half the distance.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So why should extraterrestrials
have done this?

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly these stones
would survive for thousands

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Later generations, us,
we will measure it.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
We will realize this
is not coincidence.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
We will realize they are
Pythagorean triangles.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And now the humans will come
up with the questions, why?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:90%
What's behind it?

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
why they did it.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
They wanted that we
start with the questions.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the day we have now.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
We have asked the questions.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know from which solar
system these extraterrestrials

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:90%
have come from.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
technology they

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
used to make these
gigantic distances.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
color they are,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
how they were
exactly looking like,

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:90%
but that we have some answers.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
This planet was visited by
beings from outer space.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
This we can prove
in the meantime.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:84%
We have too much
old holy writings,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and we have too much hard facts.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The teachers must have been
very sensitive to teach

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
at least some of the humans,
which they thought these

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:90%
are the most intelligent ones.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And they later
became the leaders

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
to teach them in astronomy
and the mathematics.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you need
mathematics, otherwise,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.111 align:middle line:90%
you cannot do all these things.

00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Just a few months ago,
I was in Indonesia.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And in Indonesia,
there is a place

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:90%
with the name Gunung Padang.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It's in the jungle.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Nobody, practically, was there.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And archeology says this place
must be 23,000 years old.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Very, very old,
and the whole place

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
is composed of really
10,000 stone blocks.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
They are volcanic,
of volcanic origin,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and we called them basalt.
The material is basalt.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very odd.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have no idea who
transported all these blocks

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:90%
to that place.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, 23,000 years ago,
is very, very long.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:90%
There must have been teachers.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Another place, Gobekli Tepe--

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe is in Turkey today.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And Gobekli Tepe is, again, one
of the very, very old places,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:90%
dated at least 11,000 BC.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And we have no reason why
somebody made some stone

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:90%
structures in Gobekli Tepe.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a speculation why,
because today, Gobekli Tepe

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%
is very near.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It's about 10 kilometers
away from the place

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
where our progenitor,
Abraham, was living.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham, again, was writing
about extraterrestrials.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.260 align:middle line:84%
There is an old text called
the "Abraham Apocryphic,"

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and there Abraham, he says he
was sitting outside his tent.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Then he heard a
noise in the sky.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Some beings descended
from the sky,

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and he clearly says,
they were not human,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
that these beings tell to our
father, Abraham, if you wish,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.390 align:middle line:90%
we take you out of your planet.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:84%
You can see your
planet from upside.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham says yes,
and they go up there.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he
understands nothing.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he's coming to
a gigantic place which

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:84%
is turning always
around its own axis

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.845 align:middle line:90%
in the orbit of our planet.

00:15:41.845 --> 00:15:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham says, but I wish
to fall downward to the Earth.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
If someone wishes to
fall downward the Earth,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
that means he
cannot be on Earth.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, the
high place on which

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.997 align:middle line:84%
we stood, once he turned always
upside down and upside down.

00:16:01.997 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I saw the Earth
up and I saw the stars down.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Soon, as you are in
the mother spaceship,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
this mother
spaceship will always

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:84%
turn around its
own axis, because

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:84%
by doing so, you create
an artificial gravity

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:90%
centrifugal force.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.340 align:middle line:84%
But Abraham could
not have known this.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Abraham was brought up there.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
All what we have made, we
translated it completely wrong.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:90%
We said Abraham was in heaven.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Heaven was space
and nothing else.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:90%
All this is important to know.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So many of our ancestors were
brought into the heavens.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a boy in school,
educated in Switzerland,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:84%
they told me, if you are a brave
man, Erich, if you kill nobody,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
if you don't tell lies, if
you are honest to everyone,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
then finally, when you die,
you will come to Heaven.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is the place
of absolute happiness,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
because in Heaven, we
are united with God.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.329 align:middle line:84%
But later, as an adult, when
I learned Greek and Latin,

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I learned that
Heaven was a place

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:90%
in which fights were going on.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.134 align:middle line:90%

00:17:19.134 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Even in our region, there
was a so-called Archangel

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
whose name was Lucifer.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And Lucifer, one day,
with his disciples,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:84%
came to the throne of the
Almighty God and said,

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%
we do not serve you anymore.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the Almighty God
asked for the Archangel Michael

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
to destroy Lucifer, to
throw him out of Heaven.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So if Heaven would be the
place of absolute happiness,

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:84%
then an opposition, a war,
is impossible in Heaven.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Which means we have to translate
the word "heaven" into "space."

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And most of our human mythology
starts with a war in Heaven.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only in this
case, Lucifer in

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
the Jewish Christian tradition,
but also in many other myths.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
Greek mythology,

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:90%
we have the God father, Zeus.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Before he comes to
our solar system,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:84%
he had to fight in
Heaven against Cronus.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:90%
It always starts like this.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, coming back
to Gobekli Tepe,

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe is just
about 10 kilometers away

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
where Abraham had
his stories, when

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:90%
he was brought up to the sky.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest, maybe in honor
of these beings who brought him

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
up, they created this
gigantic place, Gobekli Tepe.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's just one
of the speculations.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
We just today know
that, of course,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the three pyramids are, again,
orientated astronomically.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And the three pyramids,
according to modern theories,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:84%
they represent the
belt of the star Orion.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, the oldest God
in Egypt was Osiris,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
but Osiris and Orion is the
same thing even in the writing

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:90%
form in the hieroglyphs.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion,
ancient structures

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:84%
were made by humans, not
by the extraterrestrials.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
extraterrestrials who

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
guided them, who teached them,
who gave them the knowledge how

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But all the dirty
job, we did it.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:90%
And why have they done it?

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Simply for us.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials,
they knew, of course,

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that these gigantic
stone monuments

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:84%
would survive for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So in the far future,
humans will see these stone

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.880 align:middle line:84%
structures, and they will
ask the same questions

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:90%
as we asked today.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Why have they made such an
effort simply for astronomy,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
searching for big stones,
moving stones around?

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they asked the same
questions which we ask now.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Why have our
ancestors done this?

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:90%
For what purpose?

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
That's all that
you have to know,

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
because this brings
you to questions.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we need for solutions
are first the questions.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
we leave today.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
We have the questions because
of these gigantic structures.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Were there
extraterrestrial teachers?

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:90%
My answer is yes.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there were
extraterrestrials.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Because in my profession, I do
not have only stone structures.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I know, of course,
the world mythology.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%
I know the relations.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I know the old holy books.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you put it all
together, no way out,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
this planet, our
Stone Age people,

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
were visited by beings
from outer space.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
They were the
teachers in astronomy,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and for them, our ancestors
made these gigantic stone

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:90%
structures.
