00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We have all heard of
the myths and the legends

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.930 align:middle line:90%
of our history.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.312 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.288 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:84%
According to archaeology,
the Great Pyramid

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.180 align:middle line:84%
was constructed by a pharaoh
with the name of Cheops.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Now how do we know
that Cheops was

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle line:90%
the constructor of the pyramid?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Have you any inscriptions
where he said I did it?

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Do we have any sculptors?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Do we have a mummy of Cheops?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Nothing at all.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:10%
Two thousand years
ago, and even more,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:10%
some of the historians of
that time were in Egypt.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:10%
For example, Diodorus Siculus,
Strabo, Plutarch, Herodotus,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:10%
they were all in Egypt roughly
2,000 years in the past.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And they all were standing
before the Great Pyramid.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And they all asked the
local priest there,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:90%
who made this pyramid?

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the local priest
said, we don't know,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
because it was made
before the Great Flood.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So how do we come to
the name of Cheops?

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus, the Greek
historian roughly 450

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
BC, he was four years in
Egypt and he wrote two books

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In his two books,
he makes clearly

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
differences between the thing
which he sees, which he smells,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
which he touches, and the
things which are told to him.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:10%
In the second book
of history he says,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:10%
someone told me that
the Great Pyramid

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:10%
was constructed by a tyrant
with the name of Khufu.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Khufu in the Greek
word for Cheops.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:90%
It's the same figure.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So only because
Herodotus has come up

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
with this name of Khufu,
Cheops, archeology

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, now we have a name.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
All true, all of the other
historians 2,000 years

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:90%
in the past, they say no.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It's wrong.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Diodorus Siculus, who was a
writer who published 43 books

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years ago, history books.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
He knows the books of Herodotus
of his Greek colleague.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said no,
Herodotus is wrong.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
It was not the Cheops who
made the Great Pyramid.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a pharaoh with
the name of Saurid.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Saurid is the same figure which
the Hebrew society calls Enoch.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Here we are again.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was the first man who
disappeared in a fiery chariot

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was the seventh patriarch
before the Great Flood.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:10%
Now ancient Arabian writers,
you find the story, for example,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:10%
in the book of al-Masudi or
Ibrahim Abdul al-Maqrizi.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They said it was
not Cheops, it was

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Saurid before the Great Flood.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:84%
But Saurid is the same figure
which the Hebrew call Enoch.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And Enoch was before
the Great Flood.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
We have a real problem
with the Great Pyramid.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:84%
You see, the building is
composed of roughly about 2

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 million stone blocks.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Now every technology
needs a history.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to move
blocks, how to chisel them,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
how to cut them, how to
transport them, et cetera.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
If we take Cheops as the
constructor of the pyramid,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Cheops' father was Sneferu.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
His grandfather came
directly out of Stone Age.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
They were no time, history,
evolution of technology

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Pyramid.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.510 align:middle line:90%
If we accept Enoch, yes.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Because Enoch was teached
by the extraterrestrials

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in construction and
all kinds of things.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Now we really have a problem.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
You see, technology, human
technology needs an evolution.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, our
forefathers, they

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:84%
learned that you needed a
stick so that you can hold

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:90%
the animals a certain distance.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Later, they learned how.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:90%
A bow, a spear appears.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
They learn slowly that there
are hard stones and soft stones

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:90%
that you can chisel.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:10%
They learned evolution
in technology.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
Now the pyramid of
so-called Cheops

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
inside has different
shafts and rooms.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, due to
our modern knowledge,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
we know there is at least
one kilometer of shafts

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:90%
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:90%
That means planning.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Planning means
engineering design.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
You have to calculate.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
But Cheops' father,
Stone Age people.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
There was no time for evolution
of technology for the planning

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:90%
of the engineers.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So if it was Enoch
before the Great Flood,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:90%
then it makes sense.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Al-Maqrizi, Ibrahim
Abdul al-Maqrizi,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.360 align:middle line:84%
an Arabian historian says
that inside the pyramid

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and under the pyramid,
there we would

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
find thousands of
books written by Enoch

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:90%
for the future of mankind.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
In our time, grace
to modern technology,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
we find always more rooms in the
pyramid and under the pyramid.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:90%
So we localize them.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Now the critics
may ask, OK, if we

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
know where these rooms
are in the pyramid,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
why don't we go
there and open it?

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Because you cannot.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
The shafts which
lead to the rooms

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:84%
are very small, about 14
centimeter on one side.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:90%
You cannot grab in there.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
You need modern
technology to go in there.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And this modern technology
is used at the moment.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
In the Great Pyramid of Egypt,
we have roughly three rooms.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
The upper room they
call the King's chamber.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The lower room they call
the Queen's chamber.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.830 align:middle line:10%
Under the pyramid
in the rock there's

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:10%
another room which they
call the Unfinished chamber.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Now in the so-called
Queen's chamber,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:84%
which is the room
in the middle, there

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
are two holes in the
walls on the north side

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:90%
and on the south side.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And some 25 years ago, one of
my friends, a German engineer,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
his name is Rudolf Gantenbrink,
he constructed a small robot.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And he received the
permission from the Department

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
of Archeology that
he could climb

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
with this robot in
one of these shafts

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.171 align:middle line:90%
from the Queen's chamber.

00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
According to archeology, they
were absolutely convinced

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that the shaft is only
about 8 meter long,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
and then it will end.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They say it's just a
symbolic shaft made

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that the soul of the pharaoh
may disappear to the stars

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So eight meter,
archeologists said.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Now some 25 years ago, the robot
of my friend Rudolf Gantenbrink

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
entered into the
south shaft, which

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:90%
begins in the Queen's chamber.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
There were two meters
first, and then you

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:84%
start climbing
inside the pyramid.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The robot climbed
higher and higher.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
The eight meter was
passed long away.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists could not
understand what was going on.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Always there were
different sorts of stone.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
There were granite, there were
alabaster, there was sandstone.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Then always the robot
passed some doorway,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.750 align:middle line:90%
stones that looked like doors.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Climbing up more and more.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Finally, 32 meter,
42 meter, 52 meter.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:10%
And at 62 meter, the
robot, because he

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:10%
had a camera on the robot,
came to a little door.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Absolute little, because
it's only 14 centimeters

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:10%
sideways on each side.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So a little door which had
two bracelets, obviously,

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:90%
two metallic bracelet.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the metallic
bracelets was broken down.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
They found it down on the
left on the right side.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:90%
So the robot had a laser.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And the laser went
under the door.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So we knew for sure
behind this door

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
there must be something
more behind this door.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is roughly
25 years in the past.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
We heard about it in the press.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
Some stories were
shown on television.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
What happened since then?

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
What's happened since the
25 years of the measuring

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:90%
robot of Rudolf Gantenbrink?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
A few years later, the American
National Geographic Society

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%
came also to Egypt.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:10%
And they have
constructed a new robot.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:10%
The new robot had a drill.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And with this,
they drilled a hole

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
into what we know
as a little door.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And they made an
international television show.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
They said now for
the first time they

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
will put a camera
through this hole

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
so that the world's eyes could
see what's behind the door.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And sorry, that
was the next lie.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:84%
The photographs they
made already before.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
The public, they knew exactly
it was nothing behind this.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It was empty.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they would never have
shown it to the world public.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, there was this
first door with the hole.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And the laser made a measuring
at about 22 centimeters

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
behind it, behind the
first door is another wall.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Now time passed,
18 years passed.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And a rich man
from Singapore came

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.270 align:middle line:84%
to the Department of
Antiquity and said

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
he has a new possibility
to destroy the wall.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:84%
The first door, 20 centimeter,
the second the wall.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
He can destroy it by
waves, by sound waves, etc.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But they did not
accept this suggestion,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:90%
the Department of Antiquity.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they gave
him permission

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to make a very, very
small hole into this wall.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
But only so small that you can
pass through with an endoscope.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
You see endoscope,
with an endoscopy

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:90%
you go into your body.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, this small hole
was drilled into the wall.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And they put this camera
of an endoscope through it.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And the endoscope made
hundreds of photos.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:84%
The computer put
these photos together.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:90%
And what's behind it?

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:90%
The next room.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Again, that means technology.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Technology means planning.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:10%
You have to plan from the
Queen's chamber these two

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:10%
walls, you have to
plan these openings.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Because on both sides you can
climb in with robot 62 meter.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to plan
the room behind it.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
All this means engineering
calculation, engineering

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:90%
design.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And all this does not fit
to the time of Cheops.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Cheops was roughly to
2,500 BC, a little more

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:90%
than Stone Age time.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:84%
The evolution of technology
was not ready for that.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
If Enoch was the constructor,
then it would fit.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Although Enoch is
older than Cheops,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was the seventh patriarch
before the Great Flood,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
so even older.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,
because Enoch was teached

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:90%
by the extraterrestrials.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And he says in his books, they
learned me all kinds of things,

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
including construction
and engineering things.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:90%
So then it makes sense.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Today maybe we could
reconstruct the pyramid.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
But it would be so extremely
expensive that no company would

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:90%
do such a thing.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, 2 and 1/2
million stone blocks fit

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
together exactly in the
way they have done it there

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
with all these rooms.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are not only the
three rooms, the Queens chamber,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.790 align:middle line:84%
the King's chamber, the
chamber under the pyramid,

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
there are many other rooms.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
That all is really
complicated, too complicated

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.803 align:middle line:90%
for a pharaoh like Cheops.

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:10%
By the way, it is not my opinion
that the extraterrestrials

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:10%
constructed the pyramid.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:10%
No, it is the humans who did it.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.584 align:middle line:10%
All the dirty work
the humans made.

00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:21.054 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:21.054 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:10%
But the engineering,
the planning

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:10%
comes from the
extraterrestrials.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.034 align:middle line:10%
But the work itself
was done by us.

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:49.504 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:49.504 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid of Egypt,
the big one and the two smaller

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:84%
ones, they exist for
mankind since eternity.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is one of
the miracles of the world.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
When the historians arrived
in Egypt some 2,000 years ago,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid
was already there.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:84%
All the historians of
the past were standing

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Pyramid.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a gigantic
monument for mankind.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the
questions come up.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:90%
For what purpose exactly?

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I again suggest they
did it for the gods.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid, the Great
Pyramid was not a tomb.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
They never found a grave inside,
not the grave of Cheops at all.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So it was a heritage for
the future of mankind.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Inside the Great Pyramid we
will probably sooner or later

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:15.730 align:middle line:84%
find books, which tell us how
it was some long, long time

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Flood.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows when the Great
Flood was, but at least 5,000,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:90%
6,000 years in the past.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Directly under the
Great Pyramid is a room

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
which is known since eternity is
called the Unfinished chamber.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The Unfinished chamber, you
have a shaft going down.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And the shaft is
119 meters long.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to go down
really on your knees,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's only
about one meter high.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And you come to the
unfinished chamber,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
there are no writings,
no chiseling, nothing.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just primitive
out of the rock.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
No one understands why this
unfinished chamber is there.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:10%
Herodotus, the Greek historian
who was there around 450

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:10%
BC, he said that under the
pyramid there is a lake, a sea.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And the sea has
absolutely clear water.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And in the water there is a
sarcophagus with the remains

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
and some gifts of
the god Osiris.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
One has to know Osiris is
the oldest god in Egypt.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.570 align:middle line:10%
And Osiris is the same
thing which in the firmament

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:10%
is Orion.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So Orion and Osiris
is the same even

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:90%
in writing in hieroglyphics.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Now Herodotus the
great historian

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
says under the pyramid is
a lake with clear water

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and a sarcophagus with
some gifts of Osiris.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists never
took this for true.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:84%
They said, what is
Herodotus telling us?

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
It is impossible that
under the pyramid

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.255 align:middle line:84%
there is a lake,
because the pyramid is

00:15:55.255 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:90%
found in the Sahara Desert.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no water, nothing.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago they
found, in fact, the lake

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:90%
under the pyramid.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I was down there.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.750 align:middle line:90%
We were climbing down there.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
First you come into a
small room and there

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:90%
are stairs, two stairs.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you go down there,
right down in a shaft.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
The shaft is big
enough for two ladders.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the ladders
are from our days.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Then you come to a small
room which is chiseled out

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:90%
of the rock, inside the rock.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And there you see seven
niches, but only in two niches

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:90%
are some sarcophaguses.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
One is made out of black basalt.
Basalt is volcanic stone.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:90%
There are no volcanoes nearby.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why they had
to use basalt sarcophagus.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And the other one is granite.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Now from this point
you again go deeper,

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:90%
another shaft into the rock.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Now the first shaft was as
large enough for two ladders.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
The second shaft has
only room for one ladder.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.820 align:middle line:90%
It's smaller.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:90%
You have to really--

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
with your elbows
you touch the walls.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Then you come under the place.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.640 align:middle line:90%
You make a right angle.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:90%
And you see, in fact, a lake.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big lake.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:20.274 align:middle line:84%
It's some sort of creek
with absolutely clear water.

00:17:20.274 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:84%
And in the water there
is a sarcophagus.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
We measured the
sarcophagus, we made

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:90%
photographs of the sarcophagus.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So the Greek
historian was right.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
He was correct saying that
there is a lake under there.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Now modern, today's
archaeologists I asked,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
what did you find
in the sarcophagus?

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.540 align:middle line:90%
They told me nothing.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if this
is the truth or not.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is
the Greek historian

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus told us about
a lake under the pyramid,

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and he was right.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.130 align:middle line:84%
All through archeology
for centuries

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:90%
said this is impossible.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The same Greek historian
said that the gods came down

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:90%
11,240 years ago.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Now archaeologists do again not
accept the 11,240 years ago,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
because history of Egypt is
roughly 3,000 years BC, but not

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:90%
11,000 years BC.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:90%
They disagree with Herodotus.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But I suggest Herodotus
is right and we are wrong.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid must be
much, much older.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It was constructed
before the Great Flood

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
by a technology which Enoch
had from the extraterrestrials.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The planning, the
engineering planning

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:90%
came from the extraterrestrials.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of the tools came
from the extraterrestrials.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
The dirty work was done
by us, by the humans.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the pyramid
was a kind of treasure.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:84%
A treasure created before the
Great Flood for the humans

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:90%
after the Great Flood, for us.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Again, in this connection I
have to come back to Enoch.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Enoch is the seventh patriarch
before the Great Flood.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Enoch learned the language
of the extraterrestrials.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:90%
He was in their spaceship.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:90%
He was teached by them.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Before Enoch left our planet
Earth, He went back to Earth

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:84%
again to say goodbye to all
his children and his wife,

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:90%
he had many wives at that time.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:10%
And he met his son Methuselah,
the same biblical Methuselah

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.580 align:middle line:10%
which becomes roughly
900 years old.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And he gives Methuselah
all his writings.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
There must be about
300 books which Enoch--

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:84%
because we have
one book of Enoch.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And there he says, I
wrote about 300 books.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.350 align:middle line:84%
He gave these 300 books to his
son Methuselah with the order,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
keep the books carefully for
the generation after the Great

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Flood.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:84%
They knew that the
Great Flood was coming.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:90%
They construct the pyramid.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
They knew that pyramid would
survive the Great Flood.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the pyramid we
will find some libraries.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, with
our modern technology

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:84%
we will find the
library of Enoch.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
shock of the gods again.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Because Enoch tells us what
really went on at that time

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.572 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Flood.

00:20:17.572 --> 00:20:20.032 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:20.032 --> 00:20:29.797 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.797 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the
pyramids were something

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:90%
like artificial mountains.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
They felt to be
nearer to the gods.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the
pyramid in Egypt,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
the big one, Cheops'
pyramid is a treasure.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Inside we will find information,
writings of the time

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Flood.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:10%
One of my friends, Robert Boval,
who is a brilliant historian,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:10%
he suggested that the
three pyramids in Egypt

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:10%
are linked with
the belt of Orion.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And the God Osiris
is the same as Orion,

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
so I could absolutely
agree with Robert Boval.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Orion is Osiris.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Now Orion's wife was Isis.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Again, Isis is Sirius.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have Orion and we
have Sirius on the star

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:90%
on the heaven.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we have some shafts
in the Great Pyramid.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And on certain dates,
I guess its March 21st,

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
these two shafts point on one
side to the belt of Orion,

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
but on the other side
to the star of Sirius.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Which makes sense.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:90%
It has all to do with astronomy.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And astronomy, again,
has to do with the gods.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And the gods, of course, were
visitors from outer space.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
There is no way out,
because they were teachers.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.590 align:middle line:84%
They taught our ancestors in
astronomy, in mathematics.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.551 align:middle line:84%
They were the
teachers from heaven.

00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:07.036 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:07.036 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:10%
I hope that we find, at least
in the Great Pyramid in Egypt,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:10%
writings, a whole
library, the library

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called
prophet Enoch, which was

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:10%
living before the Great Flood.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And in which give the order
to his son Methuselah,

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
construct the building to
hide all these books written

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:90%
by your father's hand.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:90%
That's my suggestion.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Its time that humans
learn to understand

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that the teachers of
the past were the gods.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.549 align:middle line:84%
And the gods were
extraterrestrials.

00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm Eric von Däniken.
