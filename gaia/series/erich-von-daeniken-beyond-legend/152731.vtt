>>ERICH VON DANIKEN:
We have all heard

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.970 align:middle line:84%
of the myths and the
legends of our history,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.320 align:middle line:90%
but is there another story?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:90%
India is full of gods.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:90%
There are hundreds of them.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And most of them are
related to the sky.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They were descending
from the sky.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:10%
And all of these gods are
linked to the extraterrestrials,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:10%
because they all were teachers.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
They all taught
humans in mathematics,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.570 align:middle line:10%
in calendars, and et cetera.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is
the almighty god Shiva.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And Shiva had a flying
machine, a flying bird.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:90%
This flying bird was Garuda.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And Garuda was
flying around Shiva.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, Garuda was not a normal
bird, because Garuda even

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:90%
flew to the moon.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Garuda was able to fly
away from our solar system.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Garuda also used bombs.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Garuda was bringing
his master, Shiva,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to different places in our
solar system, not only on Earth.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So Garuda was a
kind of spaceship,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.346 align:middle line:90%
space vehicle, et cetera.

00:01:22.346 --> 00:01:24.691 align:middle line:90%

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Every Indian temple-- if it
is thousands of years old,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
or if it's even
constructed in our days--

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.280 align:middle line:84%
every Indian temple, on
the top, has a vimana.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the vimana, I said
before, had different shapes.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:10%
But on every top of an
Indian temple, still

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:10%
today, you have a vimana.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of the vimanas
look like today's UFOs.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
They had the shape,
round or elliptical.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Other vimanas had
a another form.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
But still on top of the
Indian temple is a vimana.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And the vimana was one of the
flying machines of the Hindu

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:90%
gods.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.255 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Vimana is what we would
call today a space shuttle.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just a small
space vehicle which

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
moves between the planet and
the mother spaceship in orbit.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But with the vimana itself,
you don't make space travel

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
from star to star.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
These diagrams are
not extremely old.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of these diagrams
were created only

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:90%
in the 17th century.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
They are not thousands
of years old in some

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
of these Indian books.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:10%
These designers, who
made these diagrams,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:10%
they designed it
out of the old text.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
They read the old text and,
because of these texts,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:90%
they made a design.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, it must have looked
like that and that.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:10%
But the fact is there were
different types of vimanas,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:10%
which looked
completely different,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:10%
comparable to a helicopter
and a jumbo jet.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same thing,
but both machines can fly.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
The idea of chariots of the
gods has come in the Bible

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:90%
with the prophet Ezekiel.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:10%
But the prophet
Ezekiel, again, you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:10%
can compare to Indian chariots.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, what the Indian
gods were flying in chariots.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The chariots were
always vimanas.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
The chariots were always what
we would call a space vehicle,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
but not mother spaceships.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The chariots only
had a small distance

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:84%
they could move in
our solar system,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:90%
but not to another star.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.675 align:middle line:90%

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
These Indian descriptions
about flying machines

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
are not just fantasy,
are not just allegories.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.070 align:middle line:84%
They were real, because
the humans saw them,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and whole groups of humans
saw them, and then described

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:90%
what they saw.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
They described that one of the
gods descended with the vimana.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the humans, hundreds of
them, were watching them.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:10%
They described that
some of these vimanas

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:10%
had wheels and
others had no wheels.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
They described the noise
which the vimanas made.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
At least some of the
vimanas made noise.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Others were quiet.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So all of this, we
have descriptions--

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
descriptions handed down
and written by humans.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Just read the book Drona Parva.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It's full of these flying
machines of ancient India.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:10%
Professor Dr. Kanjilal, who is
a Sanskrit professor of Sanskrit

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:10%
College in Calcutta--

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:10%
a brilliant man-- he
has, in our modern time,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:10%
translated some of
these Indian Vedas

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:10%
in a special book with
the name "Flying Machine

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:10%
in Ancient India."

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is a proper
scientific work.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like in the
Bible, for example.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:10%
In the Bible, you have Moses,
First Book of Moses, chapter 3.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Then, verse number 27.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The translation of Professor
Dr. Kanjilal is the same things.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
He writes in such a way
that chapter xy, verse xy,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a scientific work.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:90%
There is absolutely no doubt--

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
no-- for the one who knows
that, in India, flying machines

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
were described, and different
types of flying machines.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And there is no doubt that
there were spaceships-- mother

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:84%
spaceships-- which were
around the Earth in an orbit.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
The vimanas were
the small vehicles.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
We would today call the
vimana space shuttles.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
You see, in orbit, you
have the mother spaceship.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The old Indian called the
mother spaceship cities

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.175 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, at least
in the translation.

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
In the Drona Parva, they
clearly say that one of the gods

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the three cities
with a gigantic weapon.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.230 align:middle line:84%
The weapon was shining
brighter than the sun.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
The elephants were
turning around.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The elephants were
burning and crying.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
All the animals were
crying and dying.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Every metal, which the
warriors had on their body,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
they took off and cried,
because the metal was hot,

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:90%
was cooking it.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
The birds who were flying
fell down from the sky,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:90%
because it was all too hot.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:10%
And then, they
say even those who

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:10%
were far away, in the far
distance of the weapon

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:10%
from heaven, the unborn
child in the mother's womb

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:10%
died, because they were all
infected by the rays of gods.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.620 align:middle line:84%
So in that time, nobody
could have known something

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:90%
about radiation; about x-rays.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
They could not have known
that even the unborn babies

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
in the mother's womb
would die because of it.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.135 align:middle line:84%
But this is clearly handed
down in the Drona Parva,

00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:20.802 align:middle line:90%
part of The Mahabharata.

00:07:20.802 --> 00:07:23.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You see, in our
Christian-Judeo tradition,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
we have what we
Christians call the Bible,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
or the Jewish community
call the Torah.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is,
let's say, 500 pages.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But the Indian traditions,
these are 5,000 pages.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not comparable.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, all the other
traditions-- the written

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.060 align:middle line:90%
traditions-- disappeared.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I said before the Maya books
were destroyed, except three,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:90%
and two of them we cannot read.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
In South America, the
Incas, they had no writing.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
In India, they had writing, an
incredible amount of writing.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
happened in Tibet.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Tibet is the highland.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
There are two writings
which survived,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:90%
the Kangyur and the Tengyur.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
These are the holy writings
of the Tibetan society.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, it starts that the
gods descended from heaven.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, these gods in Tibet, they
have names which you cannot

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
spell out.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of these gods
definitely was the teacher,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:90%
because he teach.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Their students explained
how he looked like.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
He looked like a
human, by the way.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:84%
He was very, very
smart, very nice.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And when he disappeared, they
described how he took off

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:90%
from the earth in a vimana.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And all the students
were watching the vimana.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It went slowly, slowly
up, and they saw it,

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
that the vimana has become
smaller and smaller.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
They described it, finally,
it was so small like an egg.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, it was becoming
like a little point,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and then it disappeared.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And before this god
in Tibet disappeared,

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
he left, like in
other societies,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:90%
writings for mankind.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But the writings, some were, he
says, hidden in a hiding place

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and will all only come
to the eyes of the humans

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:90%
again when the time is ripe.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we don't have
these writings of the gods.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:90%
The time is not ripe yet.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:90%
India is the land of the gods.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything is always
connected together.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Even when we hear
the story of Arjuna--

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
he was up in a
mother spaceship--

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the same story as we hear
from another part of the world,

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
from Enoch, who was up there,
who learned the language.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.185 align:middle line:84%
It's all different names, but
in the base, the same stories.

00:09:40.185 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna was the one who was up
there in the cities of the sky.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was there many
times, not only once.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Between his visits
from the sky, he always

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:90%
returned to the Earth.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna even gives the
name of his pilot.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The pilot's name was Matali,
who brought him up there.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.350 align:middle line:10%
And Arjuna describes that he saw
hundreds of different vimanas

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:10%
up there.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
There were three cities in
the firmament, not in heaven.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Heaven can be a
space of happiness.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Heaven can be a place
where we go after that.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Heaven can even be the
place where the gods rule.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But here, the three cities
were in the firmament.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
The humans observed the three
cities in the firmament.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:84%
They described them, because
they looked differently.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, Arjuna was one
of the humans who

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.860 align:middle line:84%
was up there in
these three cities,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and he describes
the three cities.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:90%
He describes the fight.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:10%
And he describes that there
were many, many vimanas.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Vimanas are different,
have different shapes.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
There is not only
one type of vimana.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You see today, we have different
shapes and types of aircraft.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
A helicopter is not the
same thing as a jumbo jet.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Or a military fighter
is not the same thing

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:90%
as a private aircraft.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
We have different
shapes in aircraft.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens
in ancient India.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
All these vimanas had different
qualities, different speed,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of the vimanas transported
20 humans out there.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Others of the vimanas had only
room for two or three humans

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
or gods.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:10%
Some of the vimanas had wheels.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:10%
With the wheels, they
could land on Earth,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:10%
and they could move on Earth.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Other vimanas had no wheels.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
They could not land on Earth.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:84%
They were always
standing over the ground.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
There are differences
in vimanas.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So the funny thing is all
of this is Indian tradition.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:10%
It's all in The Mahabharata.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:10%
And on Earth, there
are no industries

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.390 align:middle line:10%
to construct the vimanas.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So the whole knowledge of the
vimana comes from outside.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:84%
There is no
technological evolution

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:90%
for the vimanas on Earth.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
There is no report that some
humans constructed vimanas,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that there was some
sort of vimana industry

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
or an evolution in technology
to create the vimana.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
The vimanas always
came from the gods.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And the gods, again, came
in their mother spaceships,

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:84%
which the old Indian
called cities in the sky.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Every god who landed at some
place, the place on Earth

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
became holy.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And the humans were happy to be
visited and taught by the gods.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
In honor of the gods,
the humans made temples.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:90%

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Always like in Maya land, Tikal.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.465 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Tikal has a gigantic pyramid,
because the gods landed one

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:90%
year.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
In old India, it's
same situation.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
They constructed
pyramids, which are

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:84%
comparable to the pyramids
in Central America,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:84%
not comparable to the
pyramids in Egypt.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids in Egypt had
this form of a triangle.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Not the pyramids in India or
the pyramids in Central America.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:90%
They look like towers.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids in Egypt,
they have no sculptures on it--

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:90%
no heads, no design, nothing.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But the pyramids in
India and the pyramids

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
in Central America, they are
full of heads, and sculptures,

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.677 align:middle line:84%
and chiselings, and
writings, et cetera.

00:13:26.677 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Hindu mythology,
they describe twins.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:10%
The name of the twins
were the Maruts.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And they clearly say
that the Maruts were

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:90%
flying between the continents.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
They were flying between
India and Central America.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So both continents were
influenced by the same gods.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:10%
That's why we have the
same type of pyramids,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:10%
step pyramids like towers,
not comparable to Egypt,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:10%
because the Maruts--

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:10%
the twins, the Maruts--

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:10%
were flying.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:10%
The Maruts were
flying with vimanas.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:10%
And the flying
machines of the Maruts

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:10%
were described, again,
in the Drona Parva.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.222 align:middle line:10%
They described
that the machines--

00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:10%
the flying machines
of the Maruts--

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:10%
made a terrible noise.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But the Maruts-- the twins--
they could fly all over

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the planet, wherever they
wanted without landing,

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:84%
without refuel, so their energy
must have been something which

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:90%
we cannot understand.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:84%
By the way, energy of the
vimanas, in some of the texts,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:90%
the energy is described--

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
the fuel, what they
used as energy--

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
but we are not able to
translate everything.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I know Professor
Doctor Dileep Kanjilal.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
He's one who can read
the Sanskrit text.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And he told me we found writings
about the fuel, the composition

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
of the fuel, and there are
some words which we understand.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, part of
it was quicksilver.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
We can translate the
word quicksilver.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Part of it was mica.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:90%
We know what mica is, OK?

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But other components of the
fuel, we cannot translate.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Some of them sound like honey.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:90%
Honey?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:90%
What kind of honey?

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:90%
There are different kinds.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Something sweet, something-- you
know, we have no translation.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
If we would have
the translations

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
of all the components
of these vimana fuels,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
then we probably would have
a new energy for our machines

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.626 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Many of our so-called
myths have dates--

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:84%
dates about the
humans and the kings.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And these dates are, for
us humans, impossible.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:90%
I was talking about Palenque.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.925 align:middle line:84%
In Palenque, there's
tombstone under the temple

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Pyramid of Inscriptions.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Palenque, there is Pakal,
the second ruler of Palenque.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:84%
In the grave, there are
datings which you can read.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of the datings gives
a figure of 1,200,000 years

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
before Pakal.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Or in ancient Sumeria, we
had the so-called Kings List,

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
which today is in the
British Museum in London.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And there, they give the names
of all the Sumerian kings

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:90%
before the great flood.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
It comes together more
than 200,000 years.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
And then, the flood comes.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And after the flood,
the gods descended again

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
from the sky, and the gods
who ruled after the flood,

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
still together they
ruled 24,000 years,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:90%
and 301 years and a few months.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:90%
We have exact dates.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, in India, again,
in the Indian mythology,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:90%
we find impossible dates.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:90%
All these dates are confusing.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
You have a possibility but
it's really speculation.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:84%
We all know, when you
are in a spaceship, which

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
travels in a very,
very high speed,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
the time between the spaceship
and the planet is different.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So an astronaut who
would fly, let's

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
say, to the next solar
system, to Proxima Centauri,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
with a very high
speed would maybe

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
become only a few years older,
while on the planet Earth,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
2,000 or 3,000 years
might have passed.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So it might be that
these so-called gods

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, they were
traveling with high speed.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And on Earth, in fact, hundreds
and thousands of years passed.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But we are still talking
about the same gods.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the final answer.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.354 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the possibilities.

00:17:58.354 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
When I speak to
Western scientists,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:84%
for example, Germans
or Swiss Indologists,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
they say, we are talking
about the stories in the Veda.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
They say, well, it's maybe
about 500 BC, not older.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
When I ask the same questions
to Hindu professors, which

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
know much more than
our Western scientists,

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
they are saying at least
6,000 years in the past.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.398 align:middle line:84%
It's much older than
what we thought.

00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:34.888 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:34.888 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
First, the extraterrestrials,
finally, they went back home.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the mother
spaceships were destroyed.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:84%
At least two of them,
we know from Arjuna,

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:90%
they were destroyed.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the mother spaceships
simply disappeared,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
because the gods--
the so-called gods--

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.200 align:middle line:84%
they behaved themselves like
today's ethnologists would do.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:90%
They study some group.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:90%
They teach some group.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
They give some advice.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they
disappear again.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to die
here on this planet.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.750 align:middle line:90%
They run away.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And the vimanas, they
take them with this.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when we
today have ethnologists

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:90%
with high technology.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Our ethnologists, for example,
they have a photo apparatus,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.635 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they have a
light in their hand.

00:19:22.635 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:90%
They have technology.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have a rifle,
whatever, a weapon.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So all these precise
instruments-- photos, light,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
et cetera-- our ethnologists
take back with them again.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
They don't leave it there.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
happened in the past.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Their technology disappeared,
because they took it back

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we had some cases
where some objects were left,

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
6,000 years from now.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Just compare it, in
the Second World War,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:84%
some nations were fighting
against each other.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:90%
There were tanks.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Tanks at that time, in
the Second World War,

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I just remember the
tanks of Hitler,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
they were composed of
the most modern steel--

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:90%
15 centimeters thick of steel.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Where all these tanks today?

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Where is all the steel?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Where are the hundreds of
aircraft, which existed,

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.680 align:middle line:84%
or thousands of aircraft,
in the Second World War?

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Most of them disappeared because
they were simply shot down.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
The tanks were destroyed.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
survived in the museum.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:10%
That's all that there is.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:10%
A tank from the Second World
War lying down in the desert,

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.630 align:middle line:10%
it's nothing than a bit of rust.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So the objects of
extraterrestrials

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:90%
do not exist anymore.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I would be glad to find the
next extraterrestrial hammer,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
where I can write there,
well, made on Jupiter.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
something like this.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:84%
All these stories are not
mythologies or allegories.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, a mythology is
something which once was

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
reality, which the following
generations cannot understand.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.406 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that our planet
Earth would be destroyed,

00:21:02.406 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:90%
for whatever the reason is.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And a few people would
survive, let's say, somewhere

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.170 align:middle line:90%
in the high Andes or in Tibet.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would
these few humans do?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:84%
They want that the human race
survive, so they make children.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine there is a father
and he has his 2-year-old boy

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.260 align:middle line:90%
on his knees.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And while he's
talking to his boy,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
a gigantic eagle
flies over the valley.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And the father says to his
boy, look, my son, in my time,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:90%
there were birds.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:84%
They were a hundred
times bigger than that

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:90%
eagle up there in the sky.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Humans were sitting in
the belly of these birds.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
There were little windows.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
The humans were looking down.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And faster than an arrow,
these gigantic birds

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.460 align:middle line:90%
were flying over the big waters.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
They came to a country,
which had houses.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Their houses were so high they
were scratching the clouds.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Now, one generation passes.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
The boy becomes a father, and
he has now his boy on his knees.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, an eagle
flies over the valley.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would the
father say to his boy?

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:90%
You won't believe it, my son.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Your grandfather told
me once that there

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:84%
were birds which were a hundred
times bigger than that eagle up

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
there, that humans were
sitting inside the birds.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's only two generations,
and from the reality

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
of our flying aircraft
becomes a mythology.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Mythology was always a
truth, not in the detail,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:84%
not precise, and
not in the dating.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
But mythology always
has cores of truth.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And when the ancient Indians
describe flying machines--

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:90%
vimanas--

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and they described different
flying machines, that was true.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
They even say that there
was no technology on Earth

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to make these flying vimanas.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Or when, in the Drona Parva,
they describe atomic weapons.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
A light brighter than the
sun, the elephants were dying,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:90%
That was true.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.410 align:middle line:90%
It was not an allegory.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Myths just don't not happen.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Myths always have a true core.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:16.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
All the gods in our
so-called mythologies

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:90%
are related together.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Mythology was once reality, and
the different people came up

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:10%
with different names, but the
meaning behind it is the same.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:84%
For example, I know from the
Maya literature, at least

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Maya, I told you
the books were destroyed,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
but new books were written
after the destruction,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the so-called
Chilam Balam books.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And there, the Maya
priests tell us

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
about the destruction of the
Earth by a gigantic flood.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
But the same scene you
can read within Plato.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.322 align:middle line:90%
Plato is Greek.

00:23:57.322 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, between the Maya--

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:90%
Central America-- and Plato--

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Greece-- are 15,000 kilometers
and the Atlantic Ocean.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So there was no
direct connection,

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.930 align:middle line:84%
but they hand down
the same story,

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because it was the
same story, just

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:90%
written by different people.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, you never know at
what time it happened.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Compare it, again,
to Christianity.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity,
we have an example,

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:84%
which we say Jesus Christ
was living in Jerusalem.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can date
Jerusalem, more or less,

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.240 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years in the past.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
We can even make
clear the location.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem is in
today's land of Israel.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the message of Jesus
went out over the planet.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a 1,000 years after
Jesus, in Africa, a tribe

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.030 align:middle line:84%
hears for the first time
about Jesus' messages.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, they start to paint
and to construct a church,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:90%
in honor of Jesus.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
thing in old India.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.714 align:middle line:90%
Once these gods were a reality.

00:24:57.714 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
They were extraterrestrials.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.960 align:middle line:90%
They were teachers.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the people separated
and spread out throughout

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.200 align:middle line:84%
the planet Earth, and they
took their so-called myths--

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.260 align:middle line:84%
in reality, stories--
with them, and they

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:90%
rewrote them with other names.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.040 align:middle line:90%
But it's all the same story.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
The gods descended,
in all the cultures,

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.158 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:25:19.158 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I have studied really
many so-called mythologies

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
around the world from
different cultures and tribes.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And it always comes
to the same end.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:90%
The gods were teachers.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:90%
They taught humans in astronomy.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
The gods knew something
about genetics,

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
because they made
genetic changes

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
in animals, mixed creatures,
and among the humans, too.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Because our ancestors, some
thousands of years ago,

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
did not have this knowledge
about astronomy, about

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
the calendar, about
genetics, the gods

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.206 align:middle line:90%
must have been astronauts--

00:26:01.206 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
visitors, gods, from
another solar system.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm Erich von Daniken.

"Beyond the Legends."
