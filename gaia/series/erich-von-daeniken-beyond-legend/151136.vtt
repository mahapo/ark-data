00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: We
have all heard of the myths

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.930 align:middle line:90%
and the legends of our history.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.802 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:15.694 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle line:10%
Since roughly 30 years, we are
confronted with the phenomenon

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.640 align:middle line:10%
which we call crop circles.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, they were
simple, primitive circles.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And now it is normal
in our society.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:84%
We look for a
reasonable explanation.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So we found all kinds of
explanations what could it be.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And I read in the
scientific literature

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
incredible stupidities how to
explain these crop circles.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But the pictures of
the so-called circles

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
are not circles anymore.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.930 align:middle line:84%
They became bigger and bigger,
and much more complicated.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Now we always look for the next
plausible, reasonable answer.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of these reasonable
answers was it must be hoaxes.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, we found hoaxes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.540 align:middle line:84%
They admitted, they
showed even, how they

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:90%
make these circles and things.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But the hoaxes are
nothing compared

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
to the real, gigantic
pictures which in the meantime

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:90%
appear of a sudden.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases,
you can prove it.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:84%
They appear within
a few minutes.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:90%
They are there.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:90%
There's no way out.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:90%
It's no more hoaxes.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:84%
The primitive circles,
yes, are hoaxes, but not

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
the gigantic pictures.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So somebody is obviously trying
to give us an information.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I suggested that we are
visited again in our days

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:90%
They are looking to us.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Now it would be easy with their
technology to just show up

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:90%
on a gigantic football stadium.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:90%
The cameras are there already.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.040 align:middle line:90%
But because they know us--

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:90%
we are the offspring of them--

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
they know how our
reaction would be.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:90%
We would be completely shocked.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Our religions worldwide
would crash down.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:90%
It would be a catastrophe.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And they don't want to shock us.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
They know our reaction, that
they do it in another way.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, slowly, they
make gigantic pictures

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
in the ground, knowing
that humans use and search

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:90%
for the next plausible answers.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:90%
So we have 20 plausible answers.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we realize the
next plausible answer

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
makes no sense anymore, because
these things appear overnight.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:84%
These things appear
within a few minutes.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So we have to come up with
the question, what is it?

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Is someone up there who tries
to give us an information?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Are we too stupid to
understand the information,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
because we are always saying,
well, it must be wrong?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It must be hoaxes.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are hoaxes.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But the big, complicated
designs are not hoaxes anymore.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
They want that we realize there
is something out of humanity,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.730 align:middle line:90%
out of this planet.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:84%
After we have tried to explain
everything in a natural way,

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
we have to come to a conclusion.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:90%
There is no more natural answer.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.584 align:middle line:84%
There is something
behind our knowledge.

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:22.500 align:middle line:90%
That's why they do it.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:84%
UFO sightings are in
the meantime worldwide.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We have ten thousands
of people who

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
saw UFOs and people who are
serious, not only hoaxes again.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And in antiquity, we
had the same thing.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We can prove that in
antiquity, our forefathers

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
made gigantic signs
in the ground,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.655 align:middle line:90%
like today's crop circles.

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Just it was done
by our forefathers

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:90%
some thousands of years ago.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And all these designs
are laid out in a way

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that they are so big, you can
see them only from the air.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Nazca in Peru
is one of the examples.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's not only Nazca.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, because of
our flying aircraft, because

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of our helicopters, we found
gigantic designs dating

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
from prehistory time
in Saudi Arabia,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in Australia, in
today's Jordania,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
then even here in the United
States, in California,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:90%
a place called Blythe.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:90%
You see figures in the ground.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You can see them
only from the air.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico, in the
Sonoran Desert,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
there are hundreds
of designs which

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:90%
you can see only from the air.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And the main mystery is
definitely Nazca in Peru.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I was so many times in
Nazca, I made myself

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:90%
over 5,000 pictures of Nazca.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I show you here now
pictures of Nazca which

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:90%
were never shown on television.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And you really are shocked
when you see these designs

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:90%
and look at them carefully.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Until today, the
scientific community

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
has come up with the
following information.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
All these designs on the ground
is an astronomical calendar.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Then they say it was a
cult for the weather gods.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And other scientists
suggest that now it was

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:90%
a cult for the mountain gods.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I read always in
scientific magazines,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
now it is a cult
for agriculture.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:90%
My God, this is ridiculous.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:90%
There was never agriculture.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's too hot for it.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
If in every time, something
was growing there,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
green, then you would not
see the designs anymore.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Another suggests that now
it's a prehistoric Inca sport

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:84%
place, something like
a prehistoric Olympia.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Others say, no, these are
copies of Fata Morganas.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So the natives,
somewhere in the air,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
they have seen some lines,
maybe in the clouds.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a starting place
for hot air balloons.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We know that hot
air balloons could

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
have existed in prehistoric
times in South America.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:90%
It's theoretically possible.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But we have no writing, no
written record about it.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But even for hot air balloons,
you don't need landing strips.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Hot air balloons just
start in one place.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Another one said now
these are acre plots.

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But acre plots means
growing of something.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
There was never
something growing there.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Another one said, now these
are procession streets,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:90%
you know, for some religion.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It's ridiculous-- streets
which started abruptly, ended

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:90%
abruptly, etc.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Another one suggests that,
no, this is a prehistoric map.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:90%
A map for what, for where?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Or a cultural atlas--

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:84%
we have had in the scientific
community so many explanations.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And every scientist
thinks, this is plausible.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the next
natural explanation.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:90%
It's all nonsense.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Just look at these
gigantic lines.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.440 align:middle line:90%
These are eye openers.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And on television, you
never see these pictures.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
I have 5,000 of them.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
In Nazca, there you see
some mountains which

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:90%
were artificially cut off.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.680 align:middle line:84%
You never see these
mountains on television.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Somebody cut the top
of the mountain off.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:84%
You can clearly prove
it in the pictures.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Normal mountains
around Nazca, they

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.115 align:middle line:90%
come to the top from both sides.

00:07:48.115 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And you see it's the
top of the mountain.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Then you see one mountain
where the whole top is cut off.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
There is a line
on this mountain.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And under the line,
the line looking

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.170 align:middle line:84%
like an airstrip,
starting abruptly,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
ended abruptly, under the
line is a zig-zag line.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
No idea, no suggestion
what this was.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I simply suggest, or in
this case I speculate,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
it has something
to do with flying.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.880 align:middle line:84%
You see, today, we need
electromagnetic impulses,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
for example, to start machines.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic, it could
be something inside.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
We have sent a
scientific crew to Nazca.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have asked the scientists
a few questions which

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.480 align:middle line:90%
archaeologists would never ask.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.026 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists ask for datings,
for bones, for fireplaces,

00:08:36.026 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:84%
I ask, for example, please
go to the Desert of Nazca

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
with your modern
equipment and measure

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:90%
the resistance of electricity.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
What is the resistance
of electricity?

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.170 align:middle line:84%
If I have 100 volts, and then
I have a measuring device,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and I want to see if the
electricity is flowing,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
so I can measure the
flow of electricity.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know from
the scientific world,

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:84%
does the electricity
flow in Nazca?

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it the same flowing
as in the desert

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:90%
or on these so-called lines?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
They made their
scientific measurements.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And as expected, in the
desert, in the sand,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
there is no flowing electricity,
because sand is an isolator,

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:90%
like ceramic is an isolator.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But then they made the same
experience on the lines,

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
on the lines we have
cut off mountains,

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
with the zig-zag
lines around them.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the speed of the electrical
resistance was 8,000 times

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:84%
higher then just a few
meters in the desert.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:90%
So there is something.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I ask the scientists, can
you measure magnetic fields

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:90%
in Nazca?

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Is there something wrong?

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are changes
in the magnetic field,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:90%
especially on the lines.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:84%
On that mountain, they found a
magnetic field in the ground,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
under the line, which is so high
that they could not measure it

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:90%
So there is something beyond it.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knows what it
is, and nobody is allowed

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:90%
to go there or make diggings.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So we know that something
is wrong in Nazca

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
because we can measure
the flow of electricity,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.790 align:middle line:84%
the difference in the
sand, and the difference

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:90%
in the so-called lines.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We can definitely measure the
changing of the magnetic field.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:84%
On the zig-zag line, there
is something deep down there.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But in practice,
one would say, OK.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%
So make a hole.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:90%
What's so difficult there?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Nazca is completely protected.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't receive the
permission to simply scratch

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
a little stone away.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:84%
If you do something, you
are immediately arrested.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:84%
You get in jail in Peru, and
you have to pay about $10,000

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:90%
to get out again.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So we know by measurement
something is wrong in Nazca.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, we have
no possibility to check it.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It might be that in
gigantic temple structures,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
for example, the pyramid, or
in big other temple structures,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
there might be changing of the
magnetic field or electricity.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.910 align:middle line:90%
But nobody measures it.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We have only
measured it in Nazca.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:90%
There, it's true.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:90%
We can prove it.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I know from my knowledge
of ancient texts,

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
of ancient mythologies,
that some thousands

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
of years ago a gigantic
mother spaceship

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
was surrounding
around the Earth.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Now this mother ship,
spaceship, after a long trip,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:90%
they need something to refuel.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is it organic material?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it uranium?

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Whatever, so they
measure the planet.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Where could we find something?

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they are looking for gold.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And from an orbit,
they can measure.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Where do we find
gold or whatever?

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Now they simply send an
automatic space probe down.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
An automatic space probe would
not need a landing strip.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It simply came down like
one of our satellites.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.060 align:middle line:10%
And before it came
to a standstill,

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:10%
it might be that this automatic
space probe is blowing away

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:10%
some sand and stones
and etc., before it

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:10%
comes to a standstill.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the natives
was watching this.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Something was coming from
the gods, from the sky.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And this space probe
makes some measurements.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Hello, what is the
magnetic field here?

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Do we find gold,
uranium, or whatever?

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And disappears again, and now
the native goes to his tribe

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and says, hey.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Something was
descending from the god.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I saw it here, on
the plane of Nazca.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And you see a small
line simply made,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
created by the blown-away
stone and sand.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And now the natives
may think, obviously

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the gods want that we
make some lines for them.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a religion,
a cult. The natives

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
now make lines in all kinds
of directions-- small lines,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
large lines, thin
lines, long lines.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.850 align:middle line:84%
The longest of the
small lines in Nazca

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is 23 kilometers long,
over cross, mountain, hill,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:90%
straight way, 23 kilometers.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The longest of the
airstrip-looking lines

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
is 3.8 kilometers long, enough
to land a jumbo jet now.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:90%
That was my suggestion.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The lines were
made by the natives

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.480 align:middle line:84%
because it has become
a religious cult,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.605 align:middle line:90%
but that's not all.

00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials, in fact,
they found something there,

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:90%
something which they used.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea what they used.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And they took it off from Nazca.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It was the extraterrestrials,
not the natives,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
who cut the mountain, because
something which they needed

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:90%
was in there.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:84%
By cutting off the
mountain, you have debris.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing in Nazca.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Where is all this debris
which they took off

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:90%
from the cutting mountain?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they had an
automatic landing machine.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And the landing machine was
working on a magnetic field.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And for the magnetic field,
they need a zig-zag line

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
under the line, because
with a zig-zag line,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
you compose an
electromagnetic field.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:90%
So it comes to a standstill.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And you pull it the other way
around, and you start it again.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
The local people
made the figures.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You see, you have in the ground
figures of fishes, spiders,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:84%
monkeys, birds, and
these kind of things.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.785 align:middle line:84%
And these figures were
made by the locals.

00:14:55.785 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, Nazca
is very, very hot.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
The surface of the
Desert of Nazca

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
is composed of little
brown stones and sand.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you have only
to use your shoes

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and to scratch away these
little brown stones.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And you see yourself, a higher,
bright-shining level appears.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.150 align:middle line:84%
With this, you can, in
fact, make these figures.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
There is no mystery
in making the figures.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:90%
You can also make some lines.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
This is also possible, by
scratching away with your shoes

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:90%
the surface of it.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But the large lines, starting
abruptly, ending abruptly,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
the large, big lines on
mountains which are cut off

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:84%
are not made by scratching
away with your shoes.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Here, technology was used.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.310 align:middle line:90%
So you have to differentiate.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
There was high
technology, in my eyes,

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrials,
which has

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to do with the cut-off
mountains, the zig-zag lines,

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and these things.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are imitations
of the natives.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Even after the
extraterrestrials left,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
when they have received
what they wanted,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
the natives continue to make
lines in honor of the god.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:90%
So you have both there--

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
high technology from
extraterrestrials

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
and simply primitive
lines made by the natives.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're standing in Nazca
with your foot, you see nothing.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:90%
You see no difference.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to stand
exactly on a line.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Then you see it goes down
into the ground about four,

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.880 align:middle line:90%
five centimeters.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But you see it only
directly standing there.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Two meters away, you
see no difference.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all brown rust, sand.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The natives wanted to
give signs to the gods.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:84%
One day, the work of the
so-called gods was done.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:90%
They said goodbye.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back in a
few thousand years.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye, everyone.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:90%
They disappeared.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
But on Earth, the natives
had the next generation

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:90%
and the next generation.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
talking about the gods.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said to our
grandfathers' time,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.269 align:middle line:90%
the gods from the sky were here.

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:90%
Which gods?

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Up there.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Then a high priest may
come up with a good idea.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
We must show them
signs, the gods.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We must signalize them
we are still here.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:90%
We are praying.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:90%
We are hoping of your return.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And now the natives
start to make signs

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
in the ground of such
an over-dimensional size

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that you can see them
only from the air.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And again, Nazca
is not isolated.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
I know from "The Ethiopian
Book of the King,"

00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
"The Kebra Nagast," that King
Solomon had a flying machine.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
In the "Kebra Nagast,"
it says that King Solomon

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:90%
had not only flying machines.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:84%
He had maps, maps from
the surface of the Earth.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly on which part
is a jungle, on which part

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:90%
is a desert, etc.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It might well be that King
Solomon, with one of his flying

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:90%
machines, once flew to Nazca.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.490 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu mythology, we have
the twins called the Maruts.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:90%
They are described.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:90%
They had flying machines.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
They were flying
over the planet,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:90%
visiting different tribes.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So King Solomon, the
flying Maruts twins

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:90%
were maybe in Nazca.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And they all created lines when
they came to a landing point.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And the natives
imitated and made lines.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And the natives
made signs for them.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we are here.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:90%
We expect you.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.730 align:middle line:90%
We have offerings for you.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:90%
We have food for you.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Please, visit us again.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Give us your knowledge.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.327 align:middle line:84%
That's why the natives made
gigantic figures in the ground.

00:18:58.327 --> 00:19:14.885 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
In Nazca, there is a
geometrical figure which

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:90%
is never shown to the tourists.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I made a few hundred
photos of it.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:90%
It's gigantic.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's different circles, a big
circle, two smaller circles.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And around them are
triangles and so.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is geometric,
is high geometry.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:90%
It does not fit to the natives.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Today, we don't know what
the meaning is of it.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The tourists are
not overflown there.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the tourists
today in Nazca--

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
this is another
thing which I hate--

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the pilots, they
fly the tourists

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:84%
over these signs, the
fishes, monkeys, birds, etc.,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.815 align:middle line:84%
but not over the lines and
not over the geometrical part

00:19:56.815 --> 00:19:57.770 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And just a few years ago in
England, this same design,

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
which I call looks
like a mandala,

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:84%
the same design appeared,
but this time in England.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Now between England and
Nazca, there are 20,000 miles.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
In the last few years,
in the desert of Jordan,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
again, gigantic figures were
found, only found by air.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It's comparable to Nazca, with
hundreds of designs, rings,

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:90%
circles, triangles, etc.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And this mystery
goes on worldwide.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Always some of the
prehistoric people

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.840 align:middle line:84%
made designs for the
gods, because, of course,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:84%
you can see them
only from there.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
In antiquity, the
gods were here.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:90%
The humans worshipped the gods.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The humans said to
the gods, we want

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to make a construction,
a temple, something

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in your honor, so that our
ancestors later, thousands

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, may understand
that you were here.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And the gods said, yes.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Make it.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
But make it only in this
place and in this place.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So the humans made
these structures.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Today is different.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Today, we have no high culture.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
There are no humans which
adore some gods and say,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:84%
in your honor, we want to
make a gigantic structure.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.234 align:middle line:90%

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, there is a
tribe called the Dogon.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Dogon,
they say they were

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
visited by beings from the
solar system of Sirius.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
The humans asked the gods,
where do you come from?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And they gave names, but the
names mean nothing to us.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:90%
The names are the names of them.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
To us, it's a word which has
no meaning on the firmament.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
where they came from.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
where they went.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Definitely, they went back,
and they promised to return.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.570 align:middle line:90%
They are back again.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Some thousands of years
ago, extraterrestrials

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
created the first humans,
simply Adam and Eve.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:90%
They again made children.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And their children
made again children.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:90%
They multiply and multiply.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And in these generations,
there was only one language.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve, they came directly
from the tribe of the apes.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:90%
The apes had no language.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Now Adam and Eve
in the legend were

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
put into a place
called paradise, where

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:90%
they learned the language.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Adam was the first man
who was able to speak.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
He had what we call broadcast
center to formulate words.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Now Adam was the one who
gave to everything a name.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Adam went to that.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:90%
This is called a bush.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:90%
This is called a river.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:90%
This is called grass.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Grass is not the
same thing as water.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Water is not the same
thing as the sky.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
When you want to
talk together, you

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
have to have definition,
the meaning of the object.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why Adam
started all language.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I suggest the first
language that the humans

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.990 align:middle line:84%
had was the language of
the extraterrestrials.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
This you can still
read in the Bible.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Before the Tower
of Babel, it says,

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and everyone had the same

to develop their own languages.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.410 align:middle line:84%
The first language of the
humans was the language

of the extraterrestrials.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Adam learned it from
the extraterrestrials,

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and Adam gave
everything the name.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:84%

If they used
technology, the gods,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:84%
they would give a
gigantic sign in the sky.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.010 align:middle line:84%
They would show something
big that everyone can see.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, they could
show with a laser a sign

on the moon.

we have empty moon.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So we will find
the answers anyhow.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense to be
against all these hypotheses

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial
visit in the past

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:90%
because everything points to it.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And the final answer is in us,
and our genetics will find it.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:23.390 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I am Erich von Däniken.
