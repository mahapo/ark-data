00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>> ERICH VON DANIKEN: We
have all heard of the myths

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.880 align:middle line:90%
and the legends of our history.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.256 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:15.721 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
In the Bible, we
have Ezekiel, who

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:10%
was brought up into the space.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:84%
In the apocryphal text, we
have Abraham who was up there.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.835 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of
Enoch, we had Enoch

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
who clearly described
he was there

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:90%
among the guardians of the sky.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Enoch even learns
the language of them.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:90%
So I gave just four examples.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.098 align:middle line:84%
The same situations
happen in old India.

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:50.034 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:90%
There was one of the young men.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%
His name was Arjuna.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Later he became a king.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials,
like Ezekiel, like Enoch,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:90%
they took Arjuna up to the sky.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:90%
They bring him up there.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna-- again, like
Enoch-- learns the language

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrials.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
He describes that he was
there for many years.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.224 align:middle line:84%
He even realized that the
extraterrestrials had a war.

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
They were not of
the same opinion.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
fighting against the other

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
because some of them
want to help the humans

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.141 align:middle line:84%
or did not want to
help, or they want

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:31.020 align:middle line:84%
to take out our other natural
sources, like gold, et cetera.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
were against it.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:90%
So they had the war in space.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna realized that one
of these flying machines,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:90%
some lightnings are coming out.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Two of the cities out there
were completely destroyed,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
and only one survived.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Later, Arjuna comes
back to Earth.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And while he is on Earth, he of
course describes to his people

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:90%
what he has seen.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And this was written down.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
You find the writing
in the Vedas.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.035 align:middle line:84%
You find this passage in the
fifth book of the Mahabharata.

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The Mahabharata is composed
of many, many books.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest
mythology of the world

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
in India, the Mahabharata.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the fifth book,
you'll find this description.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna says he was
brought up there.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
He even gives the
name of the pilot.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.520 align:middle line:84%
The pilot's name
was [? Matali. ?]

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And he says, up there
I saw a gigantic city.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
It was composed of hundreds of
[? bulls. ?] So [? bulls-- ?]

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.750 align:middle line:84%
one [? bull ?] in another
[? bull. ?] All this together

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:90%
made this gigantic city.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And there were three of these
cities in orbit of the Earth.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:90%
And they surrounded the Earth--

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
the same thing which Enoch
is telling in another story.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Just this time, it's
the old Indian stuff.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Enoch is telling
about the mutiny.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:90%
He's telling about destruction.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna, this time in India,
is telling about destruction,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.340 align:middle line:84%
about the mutiny, that some
of these cities in the sky

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:90%
were destroyed--

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:90%
not by humans, by themselves.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:90%
They had a war.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And here we come again
to the old situation.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:90%
A war in heaven?

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
If heaven would be
this place of happiness

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:84%
because you are united with
God, then there is no war.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The word "heaven" is
wrongly translated.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We must change the word
"heaven" into "space."

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Because there were
wars in heaven.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
There were different
humans who were up there.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
They were brought back to
Earth with more knowledge

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.240 align:middle line:90%
than before.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Heaven was space.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:90%
A war in space is possible.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.814 align:middle line:84%
That happened in
many old cultures.

00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:42.149 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:90%
We have figures like angels.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
An angel, in our
normal knowledge,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
is a being, a messenger coming
from God, down from the sky.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
We represent angels with wings,
with halos around their head.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But these angels
were not fine guys.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
These angels had sex
with some humans.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:90%
These angels were no spirits.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.090 align:middle line:84%
These angels had war among each
other described in other texts.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So we must change the
word "angel" into the word

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:90%
"extraterrestrial."

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And an archangel is one
of the leaders of one

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of the groups of the
extraterrestrials.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
We must change
only about 10 words

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
in the old so-called
holy writings,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and we change the
complete meaning.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And exactly this takes
now place in our time.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:10%
We have translations from
the Vedas in ancient India,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:10%
made with our modern knowledge,
made by Professor Dr. Dileep

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:10%
Kanjilal.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
"Flying Machines
in Ancient India."

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:90%
This is a scientific work.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not just stupid fantasy.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Every phrase is proven
with every figure,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:90%
like in the Bible.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:90%
We have description.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a
doctor in Sumerology.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
His name is Dr. [? Haman ?]
[? Burgat. ?] [? Burgat ?]

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
finally started to
translate an old text.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The text is called "The
Temporal Wall of Enheduanna."

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:10%
Enheduanna was the high priest.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:10%
She was the daughter
of Sargon I--

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:10%
Sargon, Sumerian king.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:10%
So about 2,300 BC.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Dr. [? Burgat ?] translated
the writings of Enheduanna,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:90%
of the high priest.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And he clearly, absolutely,
in his two books,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
which are on the
market now, says

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:90%
this is extraterrestrial being.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to
do with God, nothing

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
to do with natural catastrophes
like storms or earthquakes.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:90%
This is not science fiction.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We can prove it, in the
meantime, absolutely clear.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Enheduanna described it.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's time.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:90%
Our time is ripe.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
We have new translations
of the old texts.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
We should continue.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:84%
In the past, we translated
all this wrong--

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.200 align:middle line:90%
not because we were bad guys.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Not because we are stupid, or
not because of a conspiracy.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Our fathers, our
professors in the past,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
two generations ago, they
were brilliant persons.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:90%
But they had not our knowledge.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
150 years ago, there
was nothing like flying.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
like space travel.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we
have this object.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:10%
In the meantime, we know
it is possible to travel

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:10%
from star to star.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, we have the
knowledge about genetics,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that it is possible to
create a human race out

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of the family.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So we know the
situation has changed.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:90%
This spirit of time has changed.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:90%
And we are the one generation.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, with our scientific
knowledge, we could go on

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and it would be easily
to find the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
the final proof, for
extraterrestrials.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%
We could do it today.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
We could go in orbit
with the space shuttle,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and we could look for an
extraterrestrial object,

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:90%
a time capsule up there.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:90%
We will find it.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:90%
We just have to do it.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to
change the spirit of time.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
We must look at all these things
with our modern knowledge.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we come
to another answer.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is beautiful.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Concerning our past, we
know where we come from.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And concerning our
future, we know

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
we are part of a family
of extraterrestrials.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.896 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
be afraid of them.

00:07:29.896 --> 00:07:32.884 align:middle line:90%

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:90%
You see these virgin births.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.515 align:middle line:90%
They are part of antiquity.

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
These virgin births,
they existed long

before Christianity.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Many of the old figures
had virgin birth.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
The best example in
this connection is Noah.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:10%
Some 50 years ago, one of the
Dead Sea Scrolls were found,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.120 align:middle line:10%
and one of the scrolls had
the name "The Lamech Scroll."

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
what this is.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Lamech was a shepherd, and
obviously a rich shepherd.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
He had many hundreds
of thousands of sheeps.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so he was away from his home
tents, sometimes for months.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:84%
One day he came back to his
home tents, and his wife--

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
her name was Batanash-- had
just given birth to a boy.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Lamech looks at his boy and
says, this is not my boy.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely impossible
because of the months

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:90%
I was away.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:90%
I cannot have done this.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And the boy looks completely
different to the other children

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I have already.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Not the same skin,
the same eyes.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But his wife with
the name of Batanash

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:84%
swears and says, dear Father
Lamech, I really promise you

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:90%
no one has touched me sexually.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
She even says no of the other
shepherds has touched me.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
None of the soldiers--
no one has touched me.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And Lamech cannot
understand this.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:90%
The boy is finally here.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, he
loves his wife, Batanash.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So Lamech goes to
his father, which

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
is the biblical
Methusaleh, and tells him

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
the story about the son,
the new boy in the family.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I had
no sex with her,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and my wife said she
had no sex with no one.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So Methusaleh, again, does
not know a final answer

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and goes to his father,
which is no one else

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
than the biblical
Enoch, the same Enoch

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
who was in sky up there and
who learned the language

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrials.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Enoch says to his
son Methusaleh,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:90%
go to your son Lamech.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Tell him Lamech should
accept this boy as his own.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Learn him the language.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:90%
Give him the best education.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the guardians
of the sky have

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
decided to destroy all flesh
on Earth by a gigantic flood.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But this boy, the son
here, should be the father

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.490 align:middle line:90%
of the future generation.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Give him the name of Noah.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So we learn from this that Noah
was artificially inseminated.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Noah's mother, Batanash, was
artificially inseminated.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we are all the
offspring of Noah.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, we all have
extraterrestrial genes in us.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And because the time
is right, our brain

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
learns slowly that
this makes sense.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
A hundred years ago, we
could have not discussed

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:90%
such a hypothesis.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It's all garbage a
hundred years ago.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
our brain is ready.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Now we can say, come on.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
We can prove that Batanash
has given birth to a boy,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
but this was an
artificial insemination.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.020 align:middle line:90%
It was not made by a sexual act.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And we are the
offsprings of Noah.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.047 align:middle line:90%

Noah's ark was a

survived the flood.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
was the first human who left

Enoch was the first man.

Enoch.

And Enoch was the
seventh patriarch--

was the seventh patriarch.

about the Book of Enoch?

About 170 years ago,
in the meantime,

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:90%
a British man was in Abyssinia.

for 30 years in a convent.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
He learned the
language of the locals.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the old library, he found
the book, the Book of Enoch.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:84%
He knew the name of
Enoch from the Bible.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
He knew that Enoch was
the first man who left

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%

the book of Enoch.

in the third person.

they all wanted to sleep.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Then they heard the

looked to the sky,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%

object coming down.

They were afraid, the society,
the people of the village.

glittering clothes coming close

to the group of locals.

approximately two or three

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
meters away from him,
he also become afraid

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:90%
and he fell on the ground.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
He clearly said, I was lying
on the ground with my nose--

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I was respiring the
dust of the Earth.

of the stranger

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:84%

him on his feet.

And Enoch says,
there were two beings

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:90%
which I never saw on Earth.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Again, the two extraterrestrials
speak the language of Enoch.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of them says,
"Don't be afraid, human.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid."

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Which is important-- they
say, "Don't be afraid, human."

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
They do not say, "Don't
be afraid, Enoch."

God knows everything.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.620 align:middle line:84%

the name of the boy.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:90%

"Human, don't be afraid.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:90%
We won't harm you," they say.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
They finally say, "If you
wish, boy, 12-year-old, you

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
can come with us,
and we will teach you

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things which are
important for your society."

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Enoch has courage.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%
He says yes.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.670 align:middle line:90%
He goes up there.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
He goes with these two
strangers, extraterrestrials.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And only after a few
steps, one of the strangers

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
says to Enoch, "Human,
you smell terribly.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.641 align:middle line:90%
You stink."

00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they order him that
he put all his clothes up.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Completely naked, he has
to jump into a river, which

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:90%
is obviously just there.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Then he comes up
out of the river.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And when he's dry,
one of the strangers

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
gives him a cream,
a sort of cream.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Enoch writes all this.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:84%
He gave me a cream
and he ordered

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
me to put this cream
all over my body,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.550 align:middle line:84%
including my hair,
my face, all over.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Enoch even smells on
his skin and says,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:84%
"I smelled like ambrosia,
honey, and whatever."

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Then one of the strangers
gave him clothes,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:90%
some sort of clothes--

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:84%
the same clothes which
they have on-- glittering.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.555 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, the young boy, does
not know what to do with it.

00:16:57.555 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the stranger
explains him,

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:84%
how he had to put
these trousers on.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
He looks down at
him and he says,

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
"And look, I look
like one of them."

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course he's in
the same clothes now.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Then he goes up.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Similar to Abraham, he's
grown over the Earth.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Up there, he sees
gigantic crystals.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:84%
He sees crystals
glittering and so.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Doors opened automatically.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
Other doors closed again.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
First they come
into a garden, where

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Enoch says there were strange
flowers, strange vegetables,

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:90%
which I never saw on Earth.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Then they come in
a big round room.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
In the center of
room is a throne.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:10%
And on the throne, the
Highest is sitting.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, when these
three come inside--

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
two of his own men and
Enoch, altogether three--

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
come in the room, the Highest
stands up from his throne,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
goes a few steps to
Enoch, shakes his hand,

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.935 align:middle line:90%
and tell him, welcome.

00:17:57.935 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I explain
now here is truly

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
part of the Book of Enoch, but
not the way I told it here.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Our professors 150 years
ago, 160 years ago,

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
had no idea of flying,
et cetera, fully.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
They had to use the
word of their time.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:84%
They read the text
and they believed

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:90%
some ancients have come down.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.190 align:middle line:84%
They took a human
into the heaven.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So I said two
extraterrestrials came.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.230 align:middle line:84%
In the original Enoch, you
read two angels have come down.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Now I said they said,
"Human, you are stinking."

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.980 align:middle line:84%
That's written in
the Book of Enoch.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they put them
into the water.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
In the original
Enoch, they said,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.562 align:middle line:84%
"Now he was put into the
water to baptize him."

00:18:54.562 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Ridiculous, before
the great flood.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:90%
There was no baptism, et cetera.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Then he receives the cream.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
In my eyes, he was
simply disinfected.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
In the religious
version, it says,

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
now he reached the
cream of a high priest.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they give him these
clothes, glittering clothes.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
In my eyes, he receives the
same overall which they have

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:90%
before they go up to space.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
In the religious
translation, they said, now

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:90%
he's dressed as a high priest.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So we made the translation
completely wrong.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Enoch finally is up
there and he comes

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to this garden with different
plants and smells and colors.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
In religious version,
they say Enoch now

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
is walking to the paradise,
or to the heavenly garden

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:90%
of the heaven.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
In my eyes, it was
simply a plantation.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Because in an
extraterrestrial spaceship,

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
you have to grow up
your own vegetable.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Enoch doesn't know this.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he comes
in the big room

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:90%
with the throne in the center.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
In the religious
version, they say

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
now Enoch is standing
in the highest heaven,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
standing before the throne
of the Almighty God--

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
which is absolutely nonsense,
because the real Almighty God,

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.070 align:middle line:84%
even if he would have
a throne and sit there,

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
would never stand up,
shake hands with human,

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:90%
and welcome him in heaven.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We made all these
translations wrong.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Not because we were stupid--

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:84%
simply because it was the
time which was different.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.305 align:middle line:90%

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
About 1,800 years ago, there
were thousands and thousands

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
of sheets of parchments,
writing of old time.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the so-called fathers
of the church came together

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and they simply
could not understand

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
what this writing was.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.967 align:middle line:84%
So some of the writing,
they put on one part.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And other writings which
they couldn't understand,

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:90%
they put on the other part.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And often some of these
writings of the other part

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:90%
are not complete.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
the Book of Enoch,

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
we have stories which
definitely are missing.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So from one part, they
made out a book which

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:90%
later is called the Holy Bible.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And from the other
part, it was separated

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%
because it was not
complete and because they

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:90%
couldn't understand it.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And today they are
called apocryphic texts.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.202 align:middle line:84%
So the Book of Enoch is
part of the apocryphic text.

The Vatican is definitely
hiding knowledge about the ETs.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
In my eyes, they must know
about the extraterrestrials.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They have the writings
in the Vaticanic Library.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And they are very clever.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You see, the
Jesuits among them--

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I was educated for six years
in a Catholic high school led

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:90%
by the Jesuits.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.750 align:middle line:90%
They are brilliant people.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:90%
They are not stupid.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Most of them have at least one
doctorate degree, some of them

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.680 align:middle line:90%
two or three.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant people.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly
what was going on.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:90%
But again, the time is not ripe.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.930 align:middle line:84%
They cannot come out to the
public and say the angels were,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
in reality, extraterrestrials.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Enoch was not in heaven.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Enoch was in a spaceship.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:90%
The time is not ripe for this.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to
change the spirit of time.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
The spirit of time is the
knowledge of a certain time.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We know today of aircraft.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.920 align:middle line:84%
We know today that genetical
changes are possible.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We know today that space
traveling would be possible.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We know today that there are
different dimensions out there.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Our forefathers did
not know of this.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Their spirit of time was
different than our spirit

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Because of our knowledge, the
spirit of time has changed.

And we live in a
fascinating time.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Just for me, it all
goes much too slow.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because some societies-- like
the church is another society--

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
they still try to push
back the spirit of time.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:10%
They do not want
that the human race

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:10%
knows too much about the past.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.138 align:middle line:84%

Well, in the meantime,
I'm 82 years old,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:84%

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I would be very happy
it would happen.

But in the lifetime of
the young generations,

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
of our boys and girls of today,
it will definitely happen.

In the lifetime of our boys
and girls-- and, I suggest,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.210 align:middle line:84%
within the next 10 years,
and that's a long--

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
we will have official contact
with extraterrestrials.
