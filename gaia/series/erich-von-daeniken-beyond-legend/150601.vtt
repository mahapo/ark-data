00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We have all heard of
the myths and the legends

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.910 align:middle line:90%
of our history.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.280 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I was educated as a strict
Catholic and I was educated

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
in the boarding school for
six years led by Jesuits.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:90%
I knew the Bible.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We translated parts of the
Bible from Greek to Latin

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and from Latin to German.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So I really know what
I'm talking about.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:10%
And while making these
translations as a boy,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:10%
I realized that the God of the
Bible cannot be a real God.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, something
which is a real God

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.860 align:middle line:90%
is a question of definition.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:84%
God for me has to
have some qualities.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, God
makes no mistakes.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.099 align:middle line:84%
God would not need a vehicle in
which to move around from point

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.020 align:middle line:90%
A to point B. God is all over.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, God
makes no mistakes.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
He knows what he's
talking about.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Bible,
we found a god.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
He made some mistakes,
he made some errors.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
He even admitted errors, etc.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
He uses a vehicle
to move from point A

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
to point B. The result
was I had simply

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:84%
doubts in my own
Christian education

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to know if other
communities in antiquity

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
have similar stories
than we have.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why it all started
with "Chariots of the Gods."

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, in beginning of the Bible,
the second book of Moses,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
the Lord before he descends
from Heaven to Earth,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%
he gives an order to Moses.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Moses should create a gate
around the holy mountain

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
so that the people
would not camp close by.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the people
would be destroyed.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
So Moses constructs a
gate around the mountain.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The Israelites at
a safe distance.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the Lord
descends with smoke, fire,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
crumbling loud noise.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.472 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:24.456 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible it says, and the
mountain looked like an oven,

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:25.256 align:middle line:90%
like fire.

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:90%
So my God is a spiritual being.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.840 align:middle line:84%
My God does not need
a vehicle in which

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:84%
to move around, come down,
smoke, fire, loud noise,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:90%
crumbling, etc.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in the Bible,
we find many descriptions

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:90%
about extraterrestrials.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
We simply translated it wrong.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Some unknown thousands
of years ago,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.090 align:middle line:84%
a group of extraterrestrials
arrived here

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:90%
and that was not coincidence.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Because again, long before--

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:90%
millions of years ago--

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
they created life simply by
infecting a certain region

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:90%
of their Milky Way with DNA.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly
that only on planets

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
which are similar than the
one that came from life

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.430 align:middle line:90%
would be evolved.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
So they knew in advance that
they would come to Earth

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and they will find
forms of life.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of these forms
of life was our ancestor,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.760 align:middle line:84%
let's call him in a
nonscientific way an ape.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
They simply took one example
of it, took one simple cell

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
and changed the DNA in the cell.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:84%
This cell grows,
multiplies, and then they

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
put it into the womb of a
female of the same species.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
This female after a
certain amount of months

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:90%
will give birth to a child.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The child has definitely the
evolution of the parents.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean the skeleton, the bones,
the mouth, the whole thing.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But because of this
artificial mutation,

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
the child now grows
out of evolution.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:84%
All our family
members still today--

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
the apes, the
chimpanzees, the gorillas,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:84%
whatever-- they are all
the same family tree.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:90%
They are still stupid.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
If they learn something,
they learn it from us.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:84%
The chimpanzees who can't
speak, we tell them so.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:90%
But they're still stupid.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Only one species,
Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:84%
out of the same family tree
has become intelligent,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
learned a language because
of an artificial mutation

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:90%
made from the same family tree.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, as soon as you want
to have a new population,

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:84%
you need at least
two, female and male.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you end in the
story of Adam and Eve.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And the gods created humans
according to their own image.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:90%
We are the offsprings of them.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
understand us today.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
They could have destroyed
us and killed us

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.582 align:middle line:84%
throughout thousands
of years anytime,

00:05:13.582 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
but they were never doing it.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We belong to the same family.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So Adam and Eve were a creation
by an artificial mutation

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:84%
made out of the family tree
of our primitive ancestor.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
This does not contradict
evolution, by the way.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course we have evolution
until the chimpanzee,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:90%
and they still exist.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But because of the artificial
mutation, Adam and Eve,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.375 align:middle line:90%
we are the Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:05:52.375 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Before the gods, the so-called
gods, left our planet--

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible, the Paradise--

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:84%
they told them, you
humans, you can do

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.320 align:middle line:90%
everything, whatever you like.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Rule over the planet, rule over
the plants and over the trees,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.600 align:middle line:84%
rule about everything
except one thing

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
you are never allowed to do,
have sex with your own family.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But the ones which are not
mutated, because only two--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve-- and
their sons and daughters

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:90%
later, they can cross together.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Soon as one of them would
have a sexual intercourse

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
with their own family,
apes, the figure

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
of the chromosomes at that
time are still the same.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:90%
They would create some monster.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, they
say some giants.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.400 align:middle line:84%
That was the reason
for the great flood,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
according not only to the Bible,
according to the Book of Enoch.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:10%
They clearly say to
Enoch, we will bring now

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:10%
a flood to destroy all these
giants and mixed creatures

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:10%
which exist in the meantime
on the planet Earth.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So according to this, the
flood was not a coincidence.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:90%
The gods created it.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a normal ship on
the ocean 200 years ago.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.650 align:middle line:84%
So they are maybe for
weeks on board the ship.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Now they come to an island
with beautiful girls.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:90%
They have sex.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happened
with the extraterrestrials.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:84%
They were for maybe hundreds
of years in their spaceships.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
They were working in this
big space, the astronauts.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Now they come to
the planet Earth.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And as the Bible says, they
saw that the daughters of man

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:84%
were beauty so they
took them to wife.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:10%
By the way, in sort of
the Bible translation,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:10%
they say the fallen angels
saw that the daughters of man

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:10%
were beauty and they
took them to wife.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:90%
What is a fallen angel?

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:90%
They who descended.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And not only in the Bible.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:84%
You find this absolutely clear
again in the Book of Enoch.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:84%
They clearly say the
guardians of the sky,

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:90%
they had a mutiny on board.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
Some of them wanted to have
sex with beautiful humans.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to have
sexual contact with them,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:90%
but it was forbidden to do so.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
That's written in
the Book of Enoch.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:90%
So they make a mutiny.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Enoch gives even
the names of 36 of

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
these extraterrestrial
figures which

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.300 align:middle line:84%
say, we want to go down
there, we want to have sex,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
we want to do this even if
it's against what the lord--

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
the lord is the commander
of the spaceship-- says.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And they had sex and the result
was some different creatures

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:90%
and giants and all these things.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:10%
In the story of Moses, together
with his brother, Aaron,

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:10%
goes to the holy mountain.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord gives him precise
measurements for the arch.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
He says, you must construct
this object so long, so large,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
so high, etc.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:90%
You must use this sort of metal.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And then he even says to
Moses, and make it exactly

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:90%
like the original you see here.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:10%
So there was an original and
Moses made the first copy.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Later, Moses came back from
the holy mountain to his people

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and the people were hungry and
they could find nothing to eat.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Bible, it says
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
was connected together
with the strange beings--

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe machinery-- which is
called the oldest of the day.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
This you do not
find in the Bible.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:90%
You find it in the Kabbalah.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:10%
And then these orders of
the day produced manna.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:10%
That means the machine, it was
a machine that produced manna.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Manna was just a
ground nourishing.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
With manna you mixed
all kinds of things.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:90%
That need energy.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The energy comes from
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
You see, the Ark
of the Covenant was

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.280 align:middle line:84%
an absolute dangerous object
and the Ark of the Covenant

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:90%
definitely had radioactivity.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:10%
In the second book of the
Kings, the Ark of the Covenant

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.410 align:middle line:10%
is transported and one
of the priests, his name

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.770 align:middle line:10%
is Oza, he simply
because there was

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:10%
a moment where the
ark looked as if she

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:10%
would fall from the wagon.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:10%
One of the priests, his name
was Oza, he touched the ark

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:10%
and at the same second he died
like from an electricity power.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the book
of Samuel, it says

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:84%
everyone who came too close to
the Ark of the Covenant died.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And they describe how they died.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Their skin became pale; their
nails, and fingers, and feet

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:90%
fell out; they were blind; etc.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So they were afraid of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and by free will, they
brought it back to Israel.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:84%
The Israelites the
next morning saw

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that the Ark of the Covenant
was here again with four horses.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The horses were
already near dead.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The children of
Israel were dancing

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.180 align:middle line:84%
around the Ark of the
Covenant, praying to the Lord

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
that the Ark of the
Covenant is back finally

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:90%
from the land of the enemy.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And at that morning,
so says the Bible,

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
72 of the Israelites
died, including children.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
What have these
children done wrong?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.440 align:middle line:84%
The only thing, they
were too close to the Ark

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of the Covenant because
the Ark of the Covenant

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely dangerous.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Aaron was the priest,
the brother of Moses,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and Aaron was the one who
created a new priesthood.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Only those ones
are allowed to go

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
close to the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They had to wear separate
suits, seven times woven,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:90%
separate clothes.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the
Covenant was dangerous

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:84%
because it was in reality
a plutonium reactor.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Plutonium reactors are used
today in our satellites.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:84%
If you need a satellite who
needs power for 20 or 40 years,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
you need a miniature
plutonium reactor.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Plutonium reactors are
never used on Earth

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because they are
incredibly dangerous.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Plutonium is really dangerous.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Just a little piece
of powder of plutonium

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:90%
can kill thousands of people.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a very, very
high radioactivity.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why we use it
only in satellites.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And they never tell it to the
humans that in these satellite,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
the energy came from
plutonium reactors.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So finally, the
Ark of the Covenant

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.620 align:middle line:90%
was back with the Israelites.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:90%
72 of them died.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
They continued their
trip and Solomon

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
created the first temple.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Solomon put the
Ark of the Covenant

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:90%
in a temple in the holy place.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Then Solomon-- by the way,
he had some flying machines--

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Solomon could fly all the time.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.600 align:middle line:84%
These flying machines of Solomon
is not part of the Bible,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.380 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the
so-called Kebra Nagast.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:84%
The Kebra Nagast is the book
of the kings of Ethiopia.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.790 align:middle line:84%
There you read about the flying
machines of King Solomon.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.240 align:middle line:90%
They even say how fast it was.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So in one day, he made
the distance of 30 days

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:90%
if you were going on the ground.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, Solomon created a
temple and had a separate room

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:90%
for the Ark of the Covenant.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, Solomon,
because he can fly,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:10%
he had a girlfriend, the Queen
of Sheba, in today's Ethiopia.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.190 align:middle line:84%
He visited her at
different times

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:90%
and they had a boy together.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
He went to visit
his father, Solomon.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So he came from two days
Ethiopia with a caravan,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.700 align:middle line:84%
with many camels, and
came to Jerusalem.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And in Jerusalem, [INAUDIBLE]
said to his father,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Solomon, my mother, the Queen
of Sheba, which you love

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE],, has some
problems for enemy

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and she asked me to
come to Jerusalem

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that I should bring
the Ark of the Covenant

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to Ethiopia to the
Queen of Sheba.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Because the people who have
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.210 align:middle line:84%
they always have
power, she said.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, Solomon said to his
son, this is impossible.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:10%
My own people, my
priests, would kill me

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.325 align:middle line:10%
if I would allow you to take
the Ark of the Covenant out

00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:10%
of the Temple of Jerusalem.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But the boy was finally
the son of Solomon,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:90%
he was a priest himself.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:84%
So at night, he went with a
few followers into the temple,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
into the room where the Ark
of the Covenant was standing.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:10%
He made an exact copy of it.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They went out again, and
outside the walls of Jerusalem

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
his artists created a copy
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.290 align:middle line:84%
At night, they made the
priest of Solomon drunken.

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:84%
They went into the
temple, they stole

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:84%
the real original
Ark of the Covenant,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
and they put the copy there.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
The next morning, the priest
didn't even realize it.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It took two or three
days before they realized

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that not the original is anymore
in the Temple of Jerusalem,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%
it is a copy.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, Solomon, he knew
exactly it was my son.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And he went with his
horses to follow,

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
but he could never reach
him because [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
with the Ark of
the Covenant again

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:84%
was flying in one
of these flying

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.810 align:middle line:90%
machines to today's Ethiopia.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So the original of the
Ark of the Covenant

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
arrived, in fact, in
two days in Ethiopia.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The Queen of Sheba, she
was very, very happy.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people surrounded
the Ark of the Covenant

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of people died,
again with the same sickness

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
as we had before in the
second book of the Kings.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Queen of Sheba
was afraid of the Ark

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:84%
She realized that this
object is dangerous.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
She put it down in a hole in
the ground, and exactly there

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
today in the Ethiopian
city of Axum,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:84%
the cathedral of the Holy
Virgin Mary is standing.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is Coptic
Christianity in Ethiopia

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and a few years ago, the
head of the Coptic Church

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
was in Switzerland
shortly and in Germany.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.472 align:middle line:84%
And one journalist
asked him, do you

00:16:56.472 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:84%
know about the Ark
of the Covenant?

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that it is in
Ethiopia under the Church

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Virgin Mary?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:90%
And the chief said, yes.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I was one of them who saw
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.250 align:middle line:84%
This object is not
from this planet.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
This object is from
another planet.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I am
asked by the critics

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
where are the proofs
for extraterrestrials?

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant,
even if only a piece of it

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
has survived, would
be final proof.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's a
question of religion.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The religions would
never allow us

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
to go down there to
make scientific research

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
on this object.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:90%
So the time is not right for it.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.090 align:middle line:84%
We have change, again,
this period of time.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:90%
You see, my God--

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.520 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion, in my dreams--

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
does not need a vehicle
in which to move around.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:90%
God is omnipresent.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:84%
God is like a spirit,
he's always there.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Bible,
the prophet Ezekiel

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:90%
describes a strange story.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
He says, when I was
captured among the captives

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
at the river of Chebar.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
at that time,

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem was overtaken
by the Babylonians.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
The Babylonians
ruled over Jerusalem

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and the high
society of Jerusalem

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.610 align:middle line:84%
went as captured as
slaves to Babylonia.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
There they had to work
for the Babylonians.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel by profession was a
high priest of the temple,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
so he was among
the high society.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
He had to work there.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, when these
slaves are working

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and Ezekiel writes all
this in the first person,

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.650 align:middle line:90%
that means the I form--

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:90%
I did, I saw, I realized --

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
not a story in the
third person, I saw.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel writes that
all of a sudden,

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%
they hear a noise in the sky.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:90%
All the slaves looked up there.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Then he sees an object
coming down from the sky.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Then he realizes the object
makes a tremendous noise.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
He compares the noise with
the thundering of a waterfall

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
or he compares it
with fighting wagons.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
So a terrible noise [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
All the slaves looking there,
the objects comes down,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:90%
sand is blown up.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel is high
priest by profession,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
so he believes in the
beginning it must be God.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
He falls on his nose
to pray to the Lord.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized
this is not God.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And then he describes
exactly what he sees.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.930 align:middle line:84%
He describes no
longer the noise.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:90%
He describes the wings.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:90%
The wings move.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
When the wings move,
there's a tremendous noise

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:90%
starting to be there again.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600 align:middle line:84%
When the wings stood still,
they were hanging down.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:90%
He describes the legs.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
He clearly says the
legs were out of metal.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Then he cries the wheel.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And the wheel
shocked him totally

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:84%
because the wheel of his times
can go forward and backward.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But the wheel
which he sees here,

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:84%
they go also forward
and backward,

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time left and
right without making a steering

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
You see, when you are
sitting in your car today

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and you want to make a
curve, you make on your wheel

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:84%
a curve, a steering movement,
and the wheels are turning now

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:90%
that you come in your curve.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel sees a wheel which
goes forward, backward, right,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and left without making
a steering movement.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
This shocks him so he
can't understand it.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:90%
He describes it four times.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Some 30 years ago, I
had a secret speech

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.735 align:middle line:84%
at the headquarters
of NASA in Huntsville,

00:20:50.735 --> 00:20:51.685 align:middle line:90%
in the United States--

00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:52.485 align:middle line:90%
secret.

00:20:52.485 --> 00:20:53.285 align:middle line:90%
Why secret?

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Because both parties
agreed not to go to public.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I did not say a word at that
time and the other part not.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And in this speech, I also
talked for about five minutes

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:90%
about Ezekiel.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And after the speech,
we had dinner together

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and the chief of the
Department of Construction,

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and ex-German-- his name
was Joseph Blumrich--

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:84%
who came to me and said,
that was very interesting.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
But Mr. von Daniken,
in the Bible

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.410 align:middle line:90%
you will never find technology.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:90%
The Bible, this is imagination.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.680 align:middle line:84%
These are dreamings, these are
visions but not technology.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, he said, I
was the first one

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:90%
who brought him up to Ezekiel.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:90%
He never read Ezekiel before.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Now he will do it.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:10%
He started to read
Ezekiel and finally he

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:46.510 align:middle line:10%
realized that whatever
Ezekiel described is real.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They have it on their
design desk today.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And he started to reconstruct
Ezekiel's description.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:10%
The outcome was a book
with the English title,

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:10%
"The Spaceships of Ezekiel."

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And in the foreword of
it, Mr. Joe Blumrich,

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:10%
the ex-chief of the Construction
Department at NASA said,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:10%
I absolutely started this
work to disprove Erich von

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.350 align:middle line:10%
Däniken's story of Ezekiel.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was absolutely
sensational what comes out.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel did see an
extraterrestrial spacecraft.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, Ezekiel's spaceship
is not a mother spaceship

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.240 align:middle line:10%
with which you can move
from star to start.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel's spaceship is only
an object which today we

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:90%
would call space shuttle.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.992 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
a mother spaceship

00:22:32.992 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and from the mother
spaceship a smaller vehicle

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:90%
comes down to the Earth.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it was.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, Ezekiel describes--

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it's after
chapter 40 or so--

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.840 align:middle line:90%
that the splendidness of God--

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
yes, by the way, this
is very important.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I knew the original Ezekiel.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I read it first in Hebrew.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I did not learn
specially Hebrew,

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
but we had the
Latin translation.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the original Ezekiel,
the word God never appears--

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:90%
never.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel says it was the
splendidness of the highest.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:84%
The word God in the
Bible only comes in later

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:90%
by the translators.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.230 align:middle line:84%
The translator thinks by the
splendidness of the highest,

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
he means God.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
In the original the word
God is never mentioned.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So in theology, they say,
well, Ezekiel had a vision.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
He saw God sitting on
his flying chariot.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:10%
As I said before, for me God
does not need a flying chariot.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, anyhow, he continues
in the book of Ezekiel

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and says that the
splendidness of the highest

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
arrived a second time and this
time, the hand of the highest

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:90%
put him on the throne.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:84%
In my view, he was sitting
in the co-pilot's chair.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he describes
how they started.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, and the hand of the
highest pressed upon my chest

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
because he feels the
gravity when starting.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
He does not know where the
trip goes because he says,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
they brought me on a
very, very high mountain.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:90%
He clearly says very, very--

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
not just very high mountains,
but very, very high mountain.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know where he is.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.260 align:middle line:84%
He looks down and he
sees under him something

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.740 align:middle line:84%
like a city, a small
city or a big village

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and in the center of it,
something like a temple.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the word temple,
again, we have to analyze.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:84%
What was a temple
for our forefathers?

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
A temple was a place where
the gods were living.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Later, we made temples,
churches in believing

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
that now God will
come into there

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.590 align:middle line:90%
in the original [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So he saw something
like a temple

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
in this big village
or small city.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting himself in
the splendidness of the God

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:90%
in the co-pilot's seat.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The splendidness of the
Lord comes to a standstill

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:90%
over the temple.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:10%
Slowly, slowly he sinks
inside the so-called temple

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:10%
and Ezekiel realizes
at that moment

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:10%
that the noise of the wings
was this time higher and louder

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:10%
than what he had heard
before in the desert

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:10%
because now the echo
comes back from the walls

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called temple.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Then it comes to a standstill.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel goes out, gets
out of the space shuttle,

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and of a sudden, a
glittering beam being again,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.190 align:middle line:90%
one of the strangers.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And he says to Ezekiel,
oh humans, you humans--

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:84%
you have eyes to see,
but you see nothing

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and you have ears to hear,
but you hear nothing.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the man in
the glittering suit

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
gives Ezekiel a measuring
device in order for him

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
to measure this whole
building, the so-called temple.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel in the
meantime, he understands

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
that this has nothing to do
with God so he has courage.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:84%
He asks back to the
glittering man, why?

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Why should I
measure this temple?

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And the other one says, that's
the reason why we brought you

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:90%
here, humans.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So Ezekiel starts to measure
length and width and how many

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:90%
stairs, etc.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.160 align:middle line:84%
All this you can read in the
Bible, all the measurements

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:90%
of the so-called temple.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Germany we had a
German engineer whose name

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
is Hans Herbert Beier and
he read these measurements

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and he asked himself, is this
a true [INAUDIBLE] building

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:84%
or is he just
imagination or fantasy?

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the theologians
say this temple,

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:84%
this building is a future
temple in a future Jerusalem.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.600 align:middle line:84%
But the German engineer wanted
to know, is this a real object?

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And he started to
calculate exactly

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
according to
Ezekiel's measurement

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and outcomes a building which
looks today like a stadium,

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:90%
like a football stadium.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:07.240 align:middle line:10%
And then this German
engineer came to me

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.510 align:middle line:10%
and I saw his calculations
absolutely precise.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.290 align:middle line:10%
I asked him, have you ever
heard of NASA, of Mr. Blumrich's

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:10%
reconstruction?

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Because NASA, it only
reconstructed the splendidness

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.610 align:middle line:84%
of the highest, which
means the shuttle,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
while the German engineer
was only reconstructing

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:90%
the so-called temple.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So one had the splendidness
of the highest and the temple.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So I brought the two men
together, the German engineer

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and the NASA engineer.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And the space shuttle fit
perfectly into the temple

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:90%
by every centimeter.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
The so-called temple
was nothing else

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
but the base station for the
extraterrestrial shuttle.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.900 align:middle line:84%
They had to come to [INAUDIBLE],,
they had to repair it,

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.090 align:middle line:90%
they had to do something.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have definite
proof of all this.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And here, at least
for me, something

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:90%
is very, very important.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:04.350 align:middle line:84%
You see, when you read the
Bible just as a normal people,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:84%
you read and the temple
will be so and so long,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:84%
the temple will be so and so
large, will be so and so high,

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.010 align:middle line:90%
etc.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Will be means future.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But the original Ezekiel has
nothing written in the future.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I know the original, I
translated it myself.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
In the original, he says the
building is so and so long,

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:90%
is so and so large, etc.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.900 align:middle line:84%
How can this future, this form
in grammatic of the future?

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.530 align:middle line:84%
The theologians
believe that Ezekiel

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
had a vision of the almighty
God and the Lord now

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:84%
shows him a future temple
in the future Jerusalem.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Semitic language,
the original Semitic language,

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:90%
has no vowels--

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
has no A, E, I, O, U.
It has only consonants

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and you simply put
these vowels in it.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, because they
believe that Ezekiel

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
is talking about a future temple
in the future of Jerusalem,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
they have translated Ezekiel
in the form of the future--

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
the temple will be so and so
long, will be so and so large.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.370 align:middle line:90%
In reality, it's all present.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:19.560 align:middle line:84%
That temple is so
and so, is so and so.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.326 align:middle line:84%
The temple was nothing
other than the landing base

00:29:23.326 --> 00:29:24.700 align:middle line:84%
for the extraterrestrial
shuttle.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Imagine there is a
group of humans working

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
as slaves for the
Babylonians on a river

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:90%
with the name of Chebar.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:84%
A group of extraterrestrials
is watching them,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.210 align:middle line:90%
learning their language.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
The group of
extraterrestrials came down.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:84%
They know in the
meantime which human

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:90%
is the leader of this group.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:90%
He was Ezekiel.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.640 align:middle line:84%
By profession, he was a
high priest in the temple.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.290 align:middle line:84%
They took him and brought
him on a very high mountain

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:02.250 align:middle line:84%
in a far off country, very
high mountain far away.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:84%
They give him the order
to measure the building

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and then they bring him
back to his own people.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, his people will ask, hey,
Ezekiel, you are back again?

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.700 align:middle line:90%
We were afraid for you.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.990 align:middle line:90%
What have they done to you?

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Have you been hungry, thirsty?

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:90%
And Ezekiel is very, very happy.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
He describes his
first flight and he

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:84%
describes that he had
to measure a building.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, here are the
measuring dates, here.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Why should extraterrestrials
do things like this?

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.700 align:middle line:84%
They knew exactly
Ezekiel and his society

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:41.220 align:middle line:84%
believed that it has to do
with the real almighty God.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And because Ezekiel
had the chance

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to be taken away by
the real almighty God,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
such a description will
not just be thrown away.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Such a description becomes holy.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Such a description will enter
into the holy books of mankind.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.410 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials know
that of course, humans

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
will have wars
throughout the history,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:84%
they will fight
against each other.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But the holy texts will remain
because they are translated

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.680 align:middle line:90%
in many, many languages.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.060 align:middle line:90%
They knew this.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:84%
They knew again
in the far future,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the human race will have the
capability to fly themselves.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.860 align:middle line:84%
They will read this
old text of Ezekiel

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and they will say, come on, this
is not God; this is technology.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.592 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have
the temple, we

00:31:29.592 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
can reconstruct these things
because of the measuring

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:90%
dates of Ezekiel.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:84%
They will come to
the one conclusion

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.210 align:middle line:84%
which I said here,
it was not God;

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
it was simply a space shuttle
of the extraterrestrials.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do now or
our science has to do now

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:84%
is find the temple
where Ezekiel was.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.050 align:middle line:84%
He was on a very,
very high mountain.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have a possibility
of such a temple.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
In South America in Peru,
3,800 meters in the Andes

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
is a temple which archeology
does not understand.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The temple is called
Chavin de Huantar.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Chavin de Huantar has
no starting point.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.250 align:middle line:90%
It was promptly here.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.810 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea of the
culture of Chavin de Huantar

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
because every culture
has a development.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.140 align:middle line:84%
A culture is not just
here, it starts slowly,

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:84%
but the temple of
Chavin de Huantar

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
does not fit into the
development of a culture.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Also on the walls of the
Temple of Chavin de Huantar,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you find strange heads who
look absolutely strange.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Some of them have helmets on.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you find some
engravings of winged beings.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.725 align:middle line:84%
In archeology they call them
winged genius, winged beings

00:32:46.725 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:90%
done so precisely.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes when he was
brought up this very, very

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
high mountain, he said they came
down to the so-called temple.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.800 align:middle line:84%
The temple was
nothing but the base

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.670 align:middle line:90%
camp of the extraterrestrials.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And he saw on the wall, I
saw some hats and figures,

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and some winged
creatures on the wall.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And in Chavin de Huantar, we
find these winged creatures.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And archeology does not know
who started Chavin de Huantal,

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.350 align:middle line:84%
simply not because it was the
extraterrestrials in that case.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:24.160 align:middle line:84%
They needed on
Earth a base camp.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:10%
You see, when our scientists
or our mountain climbers,

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.450 align:middle line:10%
they go to the Himalayas, you
don't make it in just one line.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.680 align:middle line:84%
You need base
camps, stop by stop.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.630 align:middle line:84%
So the extraterrestrials needed
something like this, too.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of these base
camps was Chavin de Huantar

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and Ezekiel was brought up
there and he writes about it.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Today we find the temple.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We see these winged
creatures, etc.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:90%
It all makes perfect sense.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm Erich von Däniken.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time on
Beyond the Legend.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:58.187 align:middle line:90%
