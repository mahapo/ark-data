00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: We
have all heard of the myths

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.135 align:middle line:90%
and the legends of our history.

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:12.260 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.260 align:middle line:90%

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.282 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I was educated in Switzerland
as a strict Catholic.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as a young man,
I was a deep believer in God.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I still am
a deep believer in God.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But, as a young man, God had
to have some qualities for me.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:10%
For example, God
makes no mistakes.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:10%
God is omnipotent.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:90%
He's all over.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't need a vehicle in
which to move from point A

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to point B. Of course,
God makes no mistake.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:90%
That I had in my head.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:90%
As a 15- 16-year-old boy.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I was educated in a strict
Catholic school led by Jesuits.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And there we had to
learn Latin and Greek.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And always we had to
translate parts of the Bible

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:90%
from one language to the other.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, slowly,
that the God of the Bible

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
does not have these
qualities I expected.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:10%
For example, the
God in the Bible,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:10%
he is using a vehicle
in which to move around,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:10%
described by the prophet,
Ezekiel, for example.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And the God in the
Bible, he makes mistakes.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
He creates human, and he
says, and it was good.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But later he finds
he was not good,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and he decided to
destroy them all.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:10%
He makes experiences.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
He sent Adam and
Eve to the paradise.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And he knows at once that
they will make a sin.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And they promptly make what
he expected, what he knows.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was very disappointed.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So, I simply had doubts in
my own Catholic religion

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:90%
in my education.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know if other
communities in antiquity

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
have similar stories as
we had in my religion.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of "Chariots of the Gods."

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I started to read
Hindu mythologies.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And even in the college, I
was educated in the college,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
some of the professor who knows
that I had doubts in religion

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
said, Erich, go to
the university library

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and ask for the Book of Enoch.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And as a 17-year-old,
I read Enoch.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that here
someone is telling us

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
the story in the
first person, and he's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:84%
talking about guardians of
the sky, fallen angels, sex

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
That was really absolutely
crazy for my young brain.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So my doubts continued.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I want, in the
beginning, only as a hobby,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.150 align:middle line:90%
follow this path.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.622 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:04.622 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:90%
I was growing up in hotels.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:10%
My family were hotel managers.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:10%
So, I was growing up, running to
reception in bars and kitchen,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:10%
and so it was absolutely normal
that after my high school,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:10%
I took the way of
hotel business.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the
hotel special school.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I was a waiter.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:90%
I was a receptionist.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I was a barkeeper.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And whenever today I
sit in a restaurant

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and I realize that the
waiters or the barkeepers

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
are doing something wrong, I
said to myself, come on, Erich,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:90%
you could do better.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You could stand behind the bar
or behind the reception desk.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So, when I finally wrote
"Chariots of the Gods,"

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.894 align:middle line:84%
I was managing director of
a five-star hotel in Davos,

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
which is a place in
the Swiss Mountains.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated by the
idea that in the Bible

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
and the religions, we are the
victims of misunderstanding.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
I was fascinated.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:10%
At that time in Germany,
there was a magazine

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:10%
called, "Neues Europa"--

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:10%
"New Europe."

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:10%
And as a young man,
as a waiter already, I

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:10%
was writing for this magazine.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Even in high school,
I was good in writing.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I always had the best
notes in writing.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So, I wrote for this magazine
about mysterious things

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible, and so on.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.260 align:middle line:84%
In 1964, that was four years
before "Chariots of the Gods"

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
was on the market, I
published an article.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a full double-page
in a big Canadian newspaper.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a German newspaper
called, "Der Nord-Westen"--

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
"The North West,"
appeared in Winnipeg.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the title was, "Were the
Gods of the Bible Astronauts?"

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:90%
by Erich von Daniken.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So, I was writing
about that subject

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
long before I made
"Chariots of the Gods."

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I was working in hotels,
and the hotels had seasons,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, summer
season, winter season.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Between the seasons, I
was always traveling.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I learned, in all these books,
about archeological mysteries.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:90%
So, I wanted to go there.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And always before I went
to an archeological place,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I knew the literature
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and I knew the
scientific literature.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I knew what the archaeologists
said about such and such place.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So, I read the book
before I traveled.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Even as an 19-year-old, I was
for the first time in Egypt.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
At the high school I was, it
was a school for rich kids.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the rich kids in my
classroom was an Egyptian boy.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And he invited me to Egypt.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:10%
So, as a 19-year-old, I was the
first time sitting on a camel.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And standing before the
pyramids as a 19-year-old,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I was the first time in
subterranean caves in Saqqara.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So, I was writing
about this subject,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:90%
even as a hotel manager.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, by the years,
I knew I learned a lot.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening I was always
discussion with some guests.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Finally, one of the
guests said, you

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:90%
should write the book, Erich.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I said, the book?

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, why not?

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So, I wrote the book, "Chariots
of the Gods," in my free time

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon and evening.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And the original
book had 235 pages.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Then I sent this manuscript
to 20 different publishers

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:90%
in Germany.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And 20 publishers sent it
back, each and every one

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:84%
with, Well, this is
not for our society.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:90%
This is not for our edition.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
This is not professional
enough, et cetera, right?

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.365 align:middle line:90%
All were turned back.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the hotel guests I
had was the editor-in-chief

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.970 align:middle line:90%
of a big German magazine.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:10%
The magazine's name is
"Die Zeit" at the time.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I
have a manuscript now

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:90%
but nobody wants to publish it.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Erich, I
probably can help you.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The next morning he
was phoning to someone,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't know, and I
hear it, still as if today.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
He said to someone,
listen, Erwin, I

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
am standing here in a hotel
in Davos in Switzerland,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:90%
and I have a young man here.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And this young man has
written a complete crazy book,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
but the man is not crazy.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:90%
You should listen to him.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So, that is how was
"Chariots of the Gods"

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
was published in February,
1968, in Switzerland first.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.030 align:middle line:84%
The German title in the
beginning had, of course,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:84%
German words, "Erinnerungen
an die Zukunft,"

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:90%
means, memories of the future.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Normally, you can
memorize only the past.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:90%
You cannot memorize the future.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So, "Memories of the Future"
was the original title

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:90%
in the German language.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:10%
Because I had the idea we were
visited by extraterrestrials.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And we, the human race,
we would do the same thing

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
We will visit
other solar systems

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:90%
and we will influence others.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why "Memories
of the Future."

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
This title has come to the
desk of my British publisher.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
In London, it was
Souvenir Press.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And Mr. Ernest Hecht,
he could do nothing

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:90%
with "Memories of the Future."

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has memories
of the future.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
We can memory, have memory of
the past, not of the future.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And because I quoted Ezekiel
in "Chariots of the Gods,"

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and the word,
chariots, is expressed,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
chariots of the
gods, in Ezekiel,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Killed the British
publisher decided

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to name the book,
"Chariots of the Gods."

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:84%
In Switzerland, we have
also different magazines.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big magazines,
not just today, is called,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:84%
"Die Weltwoche," the
"Week of the World."

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And "Die Weltwoche,"
they started

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to publish that German version
of "Chariots of the Gods."

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So, it has become a
bestseller before the book

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:90%
itself was on the market.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Because at that time, I knew
already the "Mahabharata."

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:90%
I knew the Book of Enoch.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And I slowly understood, my God,
this is all a misunderstanding.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.296 align:middle line:84%
The gods must have
been astronauts

00:09:54.296 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:90%
from another solar system.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote "Chariots
of the Gods,"

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I had the opinion that I
am the first person who

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
write about these things.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Later, when "Chariots of the
Gods" were on the market,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I received several letters
where people just mentioned,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:84%
"Dear Mr. von Daniken, but a
similar idea we have already

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
in such and such a
science fiction story.'

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So, science fiction
authors were already

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
writing about this
speculation, you know,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:84%
so astronauts are
traveling to another world.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And there they are
looked at as gods.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And so, even in some
scientific newspapers--

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and all this I learned later
when "Chariots of the Gods"

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:90%
was on the market--

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
in scientific
newspapers there were

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:84%
articles written by scientists
with the same question.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So, I was not the
first with that idea,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:90%
and not the first on the market.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But I was the first one who took
it for serious, not as fiction.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:90%
I took it as fact.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I brought in
"Chariots of the Gods"

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:90%
all the sources I mentioned.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Where did I have these questions
and these answers from?

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
So, I took it seriously,

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, when "Chariots of
the Gods" was first published,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and my German publisher, he
found an English publisher.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
absolutely no professional

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
concerning writing in these
things being an author.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So, my German
publisher suggested,

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, all the foreign right,
we make half and half

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
between the publishing
house and the author.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do nothing about it.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So, the German publisher
sold "Chariots of the Gods"

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
to a British
publisher in London.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The British publisher sold the
right to an American publisher

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:90%
in New York, hardcover.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:90%
It was Putnam's and Son.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.854 align:middle line:84%
Putnam's and Son sold
the paperback rights

00:11:42.854 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to another company
in the United States.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, they sold about
8 million paperbacks

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of "Chariots of the
Gods," but this publisher

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:90%
made half and half with Putnam.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Putnam made half and half
with the British publisher.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
The British publisher made half
and half with the German ones,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.590 align:middle line:90%
and the Germans with me.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So, from this 8 million
of "Chariots of the Gods"

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
as paperback, I maybe
received a few cents per copy.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So I made money, of course.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not blaming no one,
for it was my mistake.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's not that I have
ever become a rich man.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I was crashed down from
the beginning, especially

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:84%
the archaeologists, but also
theologians crashed me down

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:90%
and made out a fool of me.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
After "Chariots of the Gods"
was a bestseller number one,

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
even in the United States, soon
after that a small booklet came

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:84%
on the market with the title,
"Crash Go the Chariots."

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:84%
The author was this professor,
Dr. Clifford Wilson.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I asked my publisher,
who is this professor

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
doctor because the press said,
he's a professor in archeology.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:10%
He crashed me down that
everything I was writing

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:10%
was nonsense and fantasy,
and I did not take seriously

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:10%
the scientific community, etc.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But my publisher said,
it doesn't matter.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
This anti chariots could simply
help the sale, so don't worry.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Years passed and I met this
professor, Dr. Clifford Wilson,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
on a TV show in Australia.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And we were very friendly,
very correct together.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And after we were
drinking a glass of wine,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and I said, professor,
what kind of archeology

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:90%
is your specialty?

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean are you an Egyptologist
or Central American

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:90%
archeologist?

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
He said, Erich, I'm
not an archaeologist.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm a minister.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm a priest.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So, do you know that
many of the attacks

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
have come from the
side of the church,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
not only the Catholic
church, different sects

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
crashed me down, made a fool
out of me because they said,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
come on, he disturbs
our believing.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.141 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
When "Chariots of the
Gods" came on the market,

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:84%
in a Swiss newspaper I was
crashed completely concerning

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:90%
the tombstone of Palenque.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It was an archaeologist who
crashed me down completely

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and who gives the scientific
explanation what all this is

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and Erich von Daniken's
just all nonsense.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Now he put me in his
article in the corner

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:90%
of a group of idiots.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fool.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I am just one who
wants to have right,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and in reality I understand
nothing from archeology.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And he was harming me and
he did it expressively.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
this archaeologist

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:90%
has become an old man.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
He wrote me a
letter two years ago

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
where he apologized
for this case.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Erich, I
was doing you wrong.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And I will not die
before you forgive me.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I wrote
him a wonderful letter.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:84%
That's all over, the fight, 40
years in the past, of course.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Be happy and go to
the next dimension.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.902 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:15.902 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:10%
All my books, not only "Chariots
of the Gods," also, our titles

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:10%
were never published
in the Communist block

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:10%
until 10 years ago, never.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I was in Poland and
I met one of the professors,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, one of
these ideologists.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, what do you
have against Erich von Daniken?

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Erich,
you know, according

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:10%
to Darwin's theory of evolution
everything has grown by itself.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:90%
It's evolution.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't need God anymore.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:90%
God is dead.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And now an idiot like you
can and creates or invents

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:90%
new gods, extraterrestrials.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:90%
That's why they were against me.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, the situation
has changed completely.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
of course, my books

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
do exist in Poland and
Romania, and so on,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:90%
including in Red China.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:10%
Whenever I am in one
of these countries,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:10%
I have to sign books,
signing sessions,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:10%
I have to give speeches.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:90%
They are very, very excited.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
is still criticism.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:90%
I love the criticism.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, soon as you speak
honestly with the criticism,

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:90%
the scientists, you are honest.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:90%
You are not bluffing.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying to
cheat him, to lie him.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:90%
And what you say is correct.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:90%
And you listen to the other.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
You're not only
talking yourself.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
After two or three
hours of discussion,

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the other side always says
to me, Mr. von Daniken,

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:90%
we didn't know about this.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:90%
We never hear about these texts.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.550 align:middle line:90%
We learn from each other.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I learn from the critics
and they learn from me.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Since "Chariots of the Gods,"
I have written 40 more titles.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And all my titles
together, worldwide, they

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
have sold about
72 million copies.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.480 align:middle line:90%
I believe that we are unique.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Mankind is something
special on this universe

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:90%
because of our education.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.490 align:middle line:84%
In the education, we
have two possibilities.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
We have religious
people, and they

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
believe that God
made everything,

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:84%
but we are the
crown of creation.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:90%
We have a scientific community.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The scientific community
says, it's all evolution,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:90%
but we are on top of evolution.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:84%
In both cases, if you look
at the religiously, crown

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:84%
of creation, or scientifically,
top of evolution,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
in both cases, we look
at us, we are unique.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Something like us does not
exist anymore in the universe.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I was young,
I had the same opinion.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I said we are unique.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Then slowly, I learned
that the gods in antiquity

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:84%
must have been astronauts,
so I have become modest.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:90%
I said, come on, Erich.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:90%
We are nothing in this universe.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So the situation has changed,
has changed my feelings.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I have become more
sober, more modest,

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and not talking nonsense and
believing we are the greatest.

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We have to differentiate
between old, holy writings

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and archaeological facts.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
From the old, holy
writings, the biggest point

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
was definitely the Book
of Enoch because Enoch

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:84%
writes in the first person,
what happened to him.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:10%
And the Book of Enoch is
not part of the Bible.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:10%
Normal people never hear
about the Book of Enoch.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:10%
And if they hear about it, is
there must be a falsification.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, you read only
two phrases about Enoch.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%
He was the first
man who disappeared

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.580 align:middle line:84%
with the fiery chariot,
the first human who

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:90%
left our planet.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I read the German
version of the Book of Enoch,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely thrilled.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.210 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Enoch I don't
consider as mythology.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Enoch is
written in the first person,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's absolutely
the top title.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:10%
On the other hand,
in India there

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:10%
is this gigantic mythology
of the Mahabharata,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:10%
the Vedic mythology.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
And there is "Drona Parva."

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
When I read "Drona Parva,"
are completely shocked

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
again because in "Drona
Parva" they clearly

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
speak about three
cities in the firmament.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:90%
The humans watch them.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:90%
They looked up there.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:84%
The three cities had
different powers, etc.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
So when I read this,
also, in the "Drona Parva"

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
for the first time I read about
atomic explosions in deep past.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Cities were
completely destroyed.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Elephants were burning,
turning around.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
All this is in
the "Drona Parva."

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:90%
When I read this, I was shocked.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Also, I said, Erich come on.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years ago
and nobody mentioned it?

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting fact,
which really shocks your head

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.030 align:middle line:90%
is the tombstone of Palenque.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I was standing on
this tombstone.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:90%
I made photos.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And you're completely shocked.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:90%
The picture is absolutely clear.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a man sitting
in a sort of capsule,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
bending forward like a
motor racing cyclist.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:90%
He uses his hand to manipulate.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:10%
He has a mask on his nose.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:10%
He's sitting on a chair.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:10%
And outside the frame
there is a linking flame.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:10%
When you see all this, you
are completely shocked.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:10%
And you know, this stone
plate was chiseled at least

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:10%
2,600 years ago in the past.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So this was the real revelation
in archaeological view.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of
Inscription in Palenque,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
which is in reality
a pyramid, according

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to official archeology is maybe
about 600 AD, so not very old.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:10%
But the tomb, with the
tombstone of Palenque,

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:10%
because there were
stalactites, stalagmites,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:10%
must be much older
than the pyramid which

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:10%
was put up later on the
tomb, so at least 2 and 1/2

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:10%
thousand years,
if not much more.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Some 30 years ago, I knew
a young man in Germany.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had a close
encounter with UFOs.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.155 align:middle line:84%
And he told me his story,
and he was absolutely

00:21:52.155 --> 00:21:55.950 align:middle line:84%
an honorable young man, and
I believed what he said.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:90%
He was in a UFO.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, when you
have a contact again with them,

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
please tell them one of my
friends is Erich von Daniken.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
He wishes that he sees or
that he was taken into a UFO.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you give him a chance?

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And my first question
would be the question

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:90%
about God and the universe.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:90%
How did it all start?

What is your religion?

What is your knowledge about
this spirit of the universe?

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Have you been here
thousands of years ago

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
or do you know of other
societies who were here

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago?

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Was I right or wrong by
saying the Bible is wrong

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
and all the religious
books are wrong?

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:90%
Was I wrong or was I correct?

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:90%

they would show up to me,

it will be official by

This is a question
of the next 10 years

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
because we have the
answer in our genes.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And we will find the answer
on the surface of Mars,

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
on the back side on the
moon, and on Sirius.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
On Mars, wonderful

been made of the surface
of Mars in a good quality.

these photos for days and days.

I know one of them.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And there are absolutely
strange structures on Mars,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
like something who
looks like a pyramid,

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
or something who are definitely
a triangle and other things.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Now again, in science
we try to find

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the next plausible, reasonable
answer, which is correct.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:90%
It's good to do so.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But if these things continue, if
we find more strange structures

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, on the moon,
for example, around Mars

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
we have two moons,
Phobos and Deimos.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And these two moons, they turn
around mass over the equator.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:84%
If one moon does
this by coincidence,

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:84%
it's possible,
but two moons not.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are the only
moons who surround

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:84%
their planet, Mars, faster
than Mars turns by itself.

Some 20 years ago,
I was in Moscow

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and I had a discussion
with Professor Shklovsky.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:10%
Shklovsky was the
head of astronomy

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:10%
at the Sternberg
Institute in Moscow.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, Erich,
these two moons surrounding

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Mars are artificial.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:90%
They are hollow.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So, this will be one
of the explanations

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:90%
in the next future.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And on Phobos, some
of our satellites

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
found something
like a monolight.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
You just clearly see the
monolight in the shadow.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do out there.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So, we will find on the
surface of these planets

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.890 align:middle line:84%
strange things, which
definitely are artificial.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And then we have no way out.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have to confess
it to the humans.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is the answer.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:84%
My desire is to change
the spirit of time.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
From all archaeological
points I have written,

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I know the scientific
literature.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I do never write about
an archaeological temple

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
or complex without knowing
the scientific literature.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Also, when I read some
mythologies, or religious books

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:84%
like the Bible, Ezekiel, I
know the scientific literature

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:10%
Concerning Ezekiel,
I read 41 books

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:10%
of theologians, professors,
doctors, brilliant men,

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:10%
who gave their explanation
about Ezekiel, how

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.060 align:middle line:10%
we must look at it.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Now it is my desire to bring at
least a little part of mankind

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.270 align:middle line:90%
to new questions.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Have we been wrong in
our interpretation,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:84%
interpreting the
Bible, the religions,

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
some of the
archaeological artifacts?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:84%
It is my wish that
a part of mankind

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
starts to rethink these old
things with the new idea,

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
with a new consciousness, and
by this, we change the world.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we changed the
feeling, we change religion,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and we become not
so arrogant anymore.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:90%
We become humble.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
We learn we are a little,
little, teeny piece

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
in a famous universe of millions
of extraterrestrial forms

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I am always looking for
stories, and at the moment

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:90%
I am writing a lot of books.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
what is possible

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and what will be possible
in genetics in the future.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out by the
scientific literature,

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.070 align:middle line:84%
will it be possible to
travel to the next stars?

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to reach
the speed of light or even

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
over speed of light?

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So I will learn all this and
I come to my own conclusions.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my
project is to speak

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.930 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of
theologians, theologians

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.690 align:middle line:84%
who generally are brilliant
people, especially

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:90%
the old theologians.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.810 align:middle line:90%
They are not stubborn anymore.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.350 align:middle line:90%
You can talk to them.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So I hope to change their mind,
and then know in some cases,

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:90%
I was successful.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's my working.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I am doing a lot
of speeches worldwide.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I try to wake up the people,
not as a figure of having right;

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I am the one who was right.

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.490 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not the idea.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I always say, please criticize.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Don't believe what I say.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Be critical, but
read the stories.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm doing now.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.710 align:middle line:84%
"Chariots of the
Gods" has definitely

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
influenced millions
of people and hundreds

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:90%
of different authors.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Since "Chariots of the
Gods," we have many books

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.460 align:middle line:84%
on the market by
brilliant people.

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Tellinger, Sitchin
are just some examples.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:84%
There are other authors, other
researchers who go on the same

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
trail and came out with
new mysteries of the past,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:90%
which I didn't.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So in my time, so
I have influenced

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:90%
a little part of mankind.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Always when I have speeches, and
I'm sitting on a signing table,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:84%
many people come to
me and say, Erich, you

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:90%
have changed my life.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I was a theologian and
you have changed my life.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I was an archaeologist,
you have changed my life.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
I see it now with
different eyes.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So I have changed
a little something.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
I'm 82 years old.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I am happy and graceful, but
my brain functions and my body

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:90%
functions, more or less.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.110 align:middle line:90%
But my brain functions.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I have not forgotten
nothing of what I learned

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:90%
in the antique, old books.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, I
will die, of course,

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
We have a brilliant
organization, our society,

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and I have a brilliant young man
who is handling this society.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And also we have
an organization.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:84%
You just go to internet,
and you look to RAMAR.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
RAMAR is society
and organization.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They put together all the
archaeological places.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can go on camera to
these archaeological places.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
They show the links
between the lines,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:90%
between all these places.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So, whenever I die, the
story I have started

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:90%
will never die out.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:90%
This will continue.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:19.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to realize we are
neither the crown of creation

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.370 align:middle line:90%
nor the top of evolution.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
We have to become
humble and learn

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that our universe is
full of forms of life,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:84%
and that we have been
visited by ETs in the past,

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.860 align:middle line:90%
and we are visited right now.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
This is what we have to
learn and to understand.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.312 align:middle line:90%
It was a pleasure to be here.

00:30:44.312 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your help
and your understanding.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:90%
