[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN: We have all
heard of the myths and legends

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.336 align:middle line:90%
of our history.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:12.460 align:middle line:90%
But is there another story?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:10%
In Central America and in South
America, we had, of course,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:10%
gods descending from the sky.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Like in every culture,
they were teachers.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And you can prove it.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Just outside of Mexico City is
a gigantic archaeological place

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:90%
called Teotihuacan.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Every tourist should
visit Teotihuacan.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
There are different
buildings and pyramids

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
lain up on a street which they
call "The Street of the Dead."

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, this street is
orientated north-south,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:10%
and the pyramids and the
buildings are on the side.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:10%
And on the top of it is a sun
pyramid and the moon pyramid.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
An American archaeologist--
his name was Hugh Harleston--

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
found out that all the buildings
on this Camino de los Muertos,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
on the Street of the Dead, are
laid out in the same distance

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
as the planets in
our solar system.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the center,
you have the Sun.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:90%
The next planet is Mercury.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Then follows Venus.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Then follows the Earth.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Then follows Mars.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Between Mars and Jupiter
is the asteroid belt. Now,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
on this street,
Camino de los Muertos,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
they have made an
artificial river.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The river is composed of
thousands of thousands

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of stones, small stones
and bigger stones.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And this river is laid
out under the Street

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead, the
Camino de los Muertos,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.330 align:middle line:84%
but in the correct distance
between Mars and Jupiter.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So the river with the
thousands of stones symbolize

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
the asteroid belt. The asteroid
belt is composed of 10,000s

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:90%
of stones.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are small.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Others of them are
very, very big.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But the natives of
Teotihuacan could not

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
have known something
about the asteroid belt.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So this continues.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
For every planet is a building,
including Uranus, Neptune,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:90%
and Pluto.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is a very teeny planet
which our astronomers detected

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:90%
in 1930.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But Pluto is part of the
system of the great, so to say,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
of the Camino de los
Muertos of Teotihuacan.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
They could not have
known something

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
about the asteroid belt,
neither something about Pluto,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's there in stone.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:10%
When Hernando Cortes--

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Hernando Cortes was
the Spanish conqueror

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:10%
who arrived a few hundred
years ago in Central America.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:10%
He passed over Teotihuacan.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It was all just covered
by grass and bushes.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:90%
You could not see the pyramids.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And Hernando Cortes
had a priest with him.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
The priest was the one who
learned first the languages

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:90%
of the native.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:10%
Bernadino de Sahagun
was his name.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle line:10%
And Bernardino de Sahagun asked
the locals, what is this here?

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:10%
What's the name of the place?

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.653 align:middle line:84%
He said, the name
is Teotihuacan.

00:03:44.653 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:90%
So what does "Teotihuacan" mean?

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
"The place where the
gods are buried."

00:03:48.900 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
In our times, they have
found, like in Egypt,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
small shafts under the
Camino de los Muertos

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:84%
from one place going
to another place.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Small shafts and
rowboats were in there,

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and they have come to a place
under the Great Pyramid,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
the Piramide del Sol,
the Pyramid of the Sun.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And the rowboat
came to a standstill

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:90%
before gigantic stone blocks.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the newest message.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
behind the stone blocks.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
But if the message of Bernadino
de Sahagun, the priest,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
was correct, maybe we find
some sarcophaguses of the gods,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrials.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I say, the ancient Indians,
we have translatings

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
of the fuel, the composition
of the fuel with us together.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
components was mica.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Teotihuacan,
there is a mica chamber

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:90%
completely isolated with mica.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It was for a long time
not open for tourists.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.179 align:middle line:84%
After I have published
it in my book,

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:90%
now it's opened for the public.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
They cannot hide it anymore.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We have no reason today why
is a whole chamber completely

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:90%
isolated with mica.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it has to do with
the fuel of the gods.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Mica has some special qualities.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, mica is
extremely heat-resistant.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why we use mica in
high ovens, high temperatures.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Mica is an electrical isolator.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why we use little parts
of mica in our computers still

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And mica is resistant
against all kinds of acids.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have heat resistance,
electric isolator,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:90%
and isolates all kinds of acid.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And we found in
Teotihuacan a whole chamber

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:90%
isolated with mica.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So the ones who gave the
order to make this chamber

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and to isolate it must
have known something

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:90%
about the quality of mica.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.254 align:middle line:84%
But the ancients could not have
known this heat resistance.

00:06:05.254 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Then we have spoken about
Tikal, Tikal, the pyramids

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.640 align:middle line:90%
in Guatemala, Central America.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
There again, under
the main pyramid,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
they found a big sarcophagus
where they believed, finally,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:84%
we find the founder
of the city, Tikal,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:90%
the one who created the city.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But inside, they
found quicksilver.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Quicksilver is, again,
one of the components

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
of the fuel of the
Vimanas in ancient India.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You see, quicksilver is
very dangerous, again.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
When you respire quicksilver,
you are dead very quick.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So quicksilver can be
isolated in mica chambers.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And quicksilver was, again, one
of the components of the flying

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:90%
machines of the Vimanas.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The dating of Teotihuacan
outside of Mexico City

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:90%
is a mystery.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
A French archaeologist,
a lady-- her name

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
was Mrs. le Jourette--
she was working

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
more than 50 years leading the
excavations of Teotihuacan.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And in her work, she says,
it's an absolute mystery.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't know even
the constructors.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You see, in Central
America, we had the Mayans,

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:90%
but Teotihuacan is not Maya.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids of Teotihuacan
are not Maya pyramids.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I said before the Mayan pyramids
are like towers, like in India,

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:90%
like towers.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But the Teotihuacan pyramid
is, again, like in Egypt.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not a tower.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a triangle.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:90%
It was not the Maya, for sure.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who
were the constructors.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why we told the
culture, the Teotihuacanos.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:90%
It's neither the Maya--

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:90%
of course, not the Inca.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:90%
The Inca were in South America.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.705 align:middle line:84%
Dating, Mrs. le Jourette said,
at least 1,000 BC, at least,

00:08:07.705 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:90%
the dating.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mentioned
before that Teotihuacan

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
is a city which has a main
road called Camino de los

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Muertos, the Street of the Dead,
where all these buildings are

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:84%
which represent
our solar system.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
1,000 BC-- that means
someone must have planned it,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
designed it, because you cannot
construct such a city in one

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:90%
generation.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
You have to plan it and you know
that your following generations

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
of your tribe will work on
this plan for maybe 300 years.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long time before you
construct all these buildings

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:90%
and the Great Pyramid.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:90%
So there was a planning before.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Planning means, again,
evolution, evolution

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
in technology, and it does
not fit to the Teotihuacanos,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:90%
the builders of Teotihuacan.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, the teachers were
the ones from heaven.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the big mystery.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea between Mars and
Jupiter is this asteroid belt.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The natives of Teotihuacan,
the Teotihuacanos, 1,000

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
before Christ, could
have known nothing

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
about the asteroid
belt. So somebody

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:84%
must have told them there is
an asteroid belt between Mars

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:90%
and Jupiter.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why they made
the layout of this creek

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
with the thousands of
stones of different shapes

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:90%
under the street.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Teotihuacan is unique.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what culture
created Teotihuacan.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call
it the Teotihuacanos.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:90%
It was definitely not the Maya.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
The Maya had a lot of style
of building step pyramids

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
like towers.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids in
Teotihuacan are different.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
They are like the pyramids
in Egypt, big triangles.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
In South America, we have,
again, gigantic temples.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
You see, in Central America, we
are talking about Teotihuacan.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
In South America
in today's Bolivia

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%
is a temple called Tiahuanaco.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.875 align:middle line:84%
The words "Teotihuacan,"
"Tiahuanaco" somehow

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:90%
are related together.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, now this is the
Inca mythology, not

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:90%
the Maya mythology.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:84%
The Inca mythology
speaks about the god.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
His name was Viracocha,
and Viracocha descended.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, he was the
teacher of mankind.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And when the Spanish
conquerors came up

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to today's Bolivia
4,000 meters high,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:84%
they saw the ruins of
this place, Tiahuanaco.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And just next to
it, just next to it,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
they saw gigantic stone
blocks on the ground.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Spanish
themselves said, even

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
we Spanish with
our technology, we

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
could not move
these stone blocks.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.895 align:middle line:84%
And they asked the locals,
the Inca who were there,

00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:90%
their priests, who made this.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And they said, it was not we.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
It was the gods who
made this in one night.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, we have the
work of extraterrestrials.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:84%
You see, we are talking about
the Stone Age society, again,

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:90%
roughly 1000 BC.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
We know what tools they had.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, these blocks
in the ground, they

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
are fabricated out of a material
which is called andesite.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Andesite is hard like chromite.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
You need a hard tool
to cut andesite,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and they've cut very
precisely on the millimeter.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:90%
You see grooves inside.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
You see blocks who look
like an H. Altogether,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:90%
all this means planning.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:84%
The locals had known
of this planning,

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and the locals had no tools
to work on these hard stones.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:84%
The locals had no possibilities
to move stone blocks which

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.480 align:middle line:90%
have 800 tons.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And we are talking of a
height of 4,000 meters,

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:90%
so there's not too much air.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
You have difficulties
to breathe.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
They move a block of 800
tons, so in my opinion,

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
we have to do here with the
work of extraterrestrials.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Why should extraterrestrials
work with stone?

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the humans
made all these things.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Imagine our astronauts would
be able to go on Mars one day,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.030 align:middle line:90%
and they construct buildings.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:84%
They would, of course,
use the stone on Mars

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:90%
for their buildings.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.380 align:middle line:84%
They would not take from the
Earth stone blocks or iron

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:90%
blocks or steel up there.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a question
of transportation.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
You use the blocks
which are there.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But what you use is your
knowledge and your tools

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:90%
to make these precise blocks.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly why they did it.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Imagine ethnologists.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Ethnologists have their
precise technology with them,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
maybe photo apparatuses,
measuring devices,

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and they don't want to
carry up all this all the time

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:90%
on their back.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:90%
They need some kind of depot.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
make a little place

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to deposit their high technology
to save it against the clouds,

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:30.152 align:middle line:84%
against the lightning,
and against the animals

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and, of course,
against the humans.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:84%
In North America, we have
a very known Indian tribe

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
called the Hopi,
and the Hopi Indians

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:90%
have wonderful traditions.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They make little figures
which they call "Kachinas."

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And the Kachinas have
the shape of a form.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a body and a kind
of mask around the head.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
You ask the Hopi about the
tradition of the Kachinas.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.295 align:middle line:84%
The Kachinas were the
high spiritual leaders

00:14:01.295 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
a long, long time
ago which taught

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
the forefathers of the Hopi.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, come back to South America.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
In South America, we have
a tribe called the Kayapo.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The Kayapo live on the
upper Amazon River.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:10%
Every year, still today, they
have a special festivity.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
One of their leaders
dresses in a straw garment.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The straw garment
covers the whole body,

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
comparable to the
Kachinas of the Hopi--

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:90%
covers the whole body.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no opening for
eyes, nose, mouth--

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:90%
it's completely covered.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the tribe
dances around this straw

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
man in straw garments, and they
sing the story of the teacher.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:84%
One day a long,
long time ago, they

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%
hear the noise in the skies.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
They were afraid, and they saw
a shimmering light coming down.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
They were more afraid, and
they went to their caves.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Finally, it became quiet.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
They went out, and in the
center of the village,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
this big being was
standing, big--

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
it had no eyes, mouth--

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:90%
nose.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
In his hand he had an object,
and he was always looking

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:90%
with this object around.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And then an animal appeared,
a jaguar, and the animal

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
went close to this
strange being.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And he just pointed with
his object to the animal,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and the animal fell down.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
It was not dead, just like
a electroshock, et cetera.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
The natives realized that
this strange being was not bad

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.520 align:middle line:90%
because it did not hurt anyone.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And the natives within three
days learned their language.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my name
is Bep Kororoti.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And the natives ask,
what is "Bep Kororoti"?

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.271 align:middle line:84%
It means "I'm coming from
the sky, from the firmament."

00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Like in all other
mythologies, Bep Kororoti

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:90%
was the teacher of then.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He taught them,
again, in astronomy.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:84%
The Kayapos know about
our solar system,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
about the planets
surrounding the Sun

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:90%
in the correct distance.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:90%
He taught them about astronomy.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
He taught them about agriculture
and different other little

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:90%
weapons and so on.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Before Bep Kororoti disappeared,
like in other places,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
he promised, I will return
in a faraway future.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, here in North
America, the Hopi Indians

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.880 align:middle line:90%
make these Kachina dolls.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And they make it also
in honor of the gods

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:10%
and that no one should
forget that the gods promised

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:10%
to return in a far future.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're speaking of South
America, upper Amazon River.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We have this guy in this
straw garment, Bep Kororoti,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same mythology.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Before he disappeared,
he promised

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:90%
to return in the far future.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have other tribes
where we can prove the gods.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You see, in Central
America, the Maya had

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:90%
a very, very precise calendar.

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
According to their
mythology, in the beginning,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.727 align:middle line:90%
four gods were descending.

00:17:17.727 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Before they touched the Earth,
they surrounded our planet,

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:90%
and they surrounded it 13 times.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Four times 13 means 52.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
The figure 52 is the ground
figure of the Maya calendar.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Every 52 years,
something starts again.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You can put many 52
years together to blocks,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
but it always ends and
begins again after 52 years.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, today, they
symbolize these four gods.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:58.170 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Mexico City before
the great Museo of Antropologia

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.270 align:middle line:84%
or if you go to Chichen
Itza or to Teotihuacan,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:90%
the natives show you this.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
There is a gigantic
pillar up to the skies.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, four Indians arrive
in their colored dresses.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:90%
They climb the pillar.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a rope with him.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Up on the pillar, they put
this rope around their foot

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and then they jump
down, open their arms,

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
like the flying gods in Tulum,
the flying gods in Chichen

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Itza, the head first.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:90%
And then the wings come down.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Now every of these
four symbolize gods--

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:84%
surround the pillar
13 times before he

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
touches with his hands the
ground, the Mother Earth, Gaia.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Before they were 13
times, it was four gods.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Four times 13 means 52, the
Maya figure in the calendar.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So still today, in full
glory for tourists,

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:90%
they show us these things.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I'm
really shocked.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.655 align:middle line:84%
A few years ago, I
was in Chichen Itza,

00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting under
a tree in the shadow.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And a tourist guide
came with his tourists,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and then he saw the four Indians
flying around this pillar.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, this
is a probe of courage.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I was like, forget it.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.566 align:middle line:84%
This is linear mythology,
not a probe of courage.

00:19:19.566 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Every human on Earth in
the past and in the present

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.830 align:middle line:90%
adores their gods.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.440 align:middle line:90%
The gods were the teachers.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Every cult does this, not
only the Maya or the Inca

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or in India, all the
cultures around the world.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And still today,
still today, we have

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
four or five big religions.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
They worship their religious
leaders or their gods.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But the gods of the past were
the teachers from outer space.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:84%
The culture of the
Maya, of course,

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
they represented
their gods in stone.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:84%
You go to Chichen Itza,
you see the descending gods

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.440 align:middle line:90%
in stone, chiseled out in stone.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:84%
You go to Copan;
it's all the same.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
You find the descending
gods all over the world.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Now we are talking
about the Maya.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And there is a place
called La Venta.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
La Venta is, again, in
Mexico, and there is a park.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And there, for example,
you find one stone

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
which is called "the
dragon monolith."

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
You see, again, a human
being, like in Palenque.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:90%
He's sitting on a dragon.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, he uses some of his hands
to manipulate some control,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.060 align:middle line:90%
and he's definitely flying.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Also, you find a big stile.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
A stile, in that
case, is a stone block

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:84%
which is about three
and 1/2 meters high.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And up there, you
see a flying god.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
You see his helmet completely,
and you see his hands

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:90%
pointing down to the earthlings.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And his knees, his feet,
are pointing out to heaven.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Down there, you see humans with
great eyes, with open eyes.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.870 align:middle line:90%
They look to the sky.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So they have chiseled their
descending god coming down

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:90%
from the sky.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:90%
These examples do exist.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
The Maya pyramids are all
linked astronomically.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about Palenque,
the Temple of Inscription,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
where the god Pakal is in his
vehicle going out to space.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The temple itself
to the pyramid is,

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.670 align:middle line:90%
again, orientated east-west now.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So it all has to
do with astronomy.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
On this planet, we
had many cultures,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and there are cultures
who were more primitive

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and others who
were more advanced

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.000 align:middle line:90%
in technology and in knowledge.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The ones who were
technologically

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
seen more primitive, they
were not visited or influenced

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.350 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:84%
The one cultures who are higher
in technology and in knowledge

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:84%
of astronomy, mathematics,
they were visited and taught

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:90%
by extraterrestrials.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.170 align:middle line:90%
That's the only difference.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Soon as we had contact
with the teacher,

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
the culture
developed differently

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
than if you had no
contact with the teachers.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing today.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:90%
You have kids out there.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The kids who are taught in
school are well-educated

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and they understand something
about reading and mathematics,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.245 align:middle line:90%
and the others don't.

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I know from all the mythologies
that the so-called gods

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:90%
promised to return one day.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
All the cultures in the past, as
soon as the white man appeared,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
the natives believed
in the beginning

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the white man was the
long-expected returned god.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:10%
For example, when
Francisco Pizarro--

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:10%
he was a Spanish conqueror.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 400 years ago, he came
to South America, today's Peru.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:11.550 align:middle line:84%
The natives believed that he was
the long-awaited returned god.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They all fell down
on their knees.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
The same thing in
Central America--

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Hernando Cortes
was the conqueror.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the highlands of
Mexico, Moctezuma was ruling.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Moctezuma was a
well-educated man.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:10%
Personality, with a lot of
gold and silver and knowledge,

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Even Moctezuma felt on his
knees before Hernando Cortes

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
because he believed the
long-awaited god has finally

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:90%
returned.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:10%
The same thing in
the South Sea--

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:10%
for example, when James Cook,
he came for the first time

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.330 align:middle line:10%
to Hawaii, the natives
believed that James Cook

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:10%
was the long-awaited god.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So all these
cultures in the past,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:58.320 align:middle line:84%
they had already the expectation
that some gods will return.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Now honestly, not every religion
can have right or can be right.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Some of them must be wrong.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:84%
There is neither Jesus
or Mahdi or Messiah

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
or ever who will return,
simply extraterrestrials.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, you ask me what happens
in connections of today.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, at the
moment, we are already

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
visited by extraterrestrials,
but they do not shock us.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:90%
They are friendly enough.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.180 align:middle line:90%
They know how we function.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
They know how our
brain functions.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They, of course,
have the technology

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to show up before a
big football stadium.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
There, all the cameras
are already there.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:10%
But the shock for humanity
would be an absolute catastrophe

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:10%
because most of the
religion would break down.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And most of millions of
people have a feeling,

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:90%
my life makes no sense anymore.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I even suggest that
the big religious leaders,

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
they would say, no, they
are not good things.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:90%
They are evil things.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Fight against them.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So the extraterrestrials
know exactly how we function.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
They know it because
we are their offspring.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.790 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to shock us.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why they slowly
observe us today.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:90%
They study us.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
What language are
these humans talking?

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:10%
What kind of bacteria
and viruses do they have?

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:90%
What kind of weapons do we have?

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Could it be dangerous for them?

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Do we have atomic weapons?

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a scientific
program of observation.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
They study us in all
fields before they

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%
make an official
shake-hand, and they

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
want that the spirit
of time changes.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to shock
mankind completely.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:84%
They want that the new
generation grows up,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and the new
generation is infected

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of the gods
that they promised to return

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and now they are back.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
I am sure at the moment,
we are under observation.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And because they don't
want to shock us,

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:84%
they make things like
these crop circles.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Crop circles-- we know
there are falsified cases.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We know how you can produce
these small crop circles.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But there are pictures in the
fields which are gigantic,

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
which humans cannot
falsify the case,

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:90%
definitely not in one night.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
So they show us by pictures
not to be shocked but learn.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Humans learn.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:84%
When always we humans see
something extraordinary,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense that we first
look for a scientific answer.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
A scientific answer
means, come to

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:90%
the next plausible explanation.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So in the crop circle
case, we find all kinds

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:90%
of plausible explanations.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we find
out the plausible

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
or the next logical
explanation is not logical

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
anymore because the
pictures, the message,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
becomes bigger and bigger.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mystery, which
forces us again to think, hey,

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here?

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Are we alone?

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Is someone out there who
tried to give us a message

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and we still are too
stupid to read it?

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
That's a kind of teaching
which goes on at the moment.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials,
for themselves,

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:90%
they learn everything about us.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And for us, they
do not shock us.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
They give us a little time,
at least one generation,

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to be prepared for
an official landing.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm Erich von Daniken.
