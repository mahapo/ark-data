>>ANNOUNCER: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.510 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.272 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:41.855 align:middle line:84%
And thank you very
much for joining me

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:45.492 align:middle line:84%
on Spirit Talk, where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:45.492 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I like your enthusiasm.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Today I thought we'd talk
about a subject which I just

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book about and
it's called The Soul.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.777 align:middle line:84%
So many of us hear
about the term the soul,

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
but we really don't know
sometimes really what it means.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean, the soul?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
the soul means?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Just jump-- say it out loud.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:90%
The soul.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Your true being.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: True being.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.784 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Your essence.

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Essence.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Higher self.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.435 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Higher self.

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:11.115 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Spirit.

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spirit.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
A little different.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:90%
So it's all of these things.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
It's higher consciousness,
it's your true being,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
it's the true
essence of yourself.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It's you beyond this personality
which you currently live in.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
This is just a small part
of who you are as a soul.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
As the soul, you are grander,
much, much bigger, much

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
more immense than just
this little physical body.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
This is just a small
part of the soul.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of analogy that
the soul is like the water,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
like an ocean, and this current
personality is like a wave.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So your soul has lived
way, way beyond and way,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:90%
way in the future.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no, no ending.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It always has been
and always will be.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:90%
That is a soul.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And a soul tends
to, if you will,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.475 align:middle line:84%
incarnate in a
physical dimension,

00:01:58.475 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:90%
in this three-dimensional world.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Or it can also incarnate
in other worlds,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in other star systems, in
other forms of being-- liquid,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
gas, air.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, eh?

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So we seem to put
limitations on the soul,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and the soul's way,
way beyond that.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
For us today who are
watching the show and being

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:84%
part of the show, let's just
say that your soul has indeed

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
spanned the breadth
of time and space.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And we as a soul have come back
through many, many lifetimes

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:90%
of experiences.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
soul can, let's say,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.727 align:middle line:84%
expand and grow based upon
the experiences it has.

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Each soul-- I find this really,
really interesting-- before we

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
come back into the
incarnation, we will sit down

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
with our counselor, our
spirit counselors, our guides,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
our teachers, and we will
really have a soul connection

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
with them and go over our soul
review and our soul blueprint,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
if you will, for
the next lifetime.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
So you will have laid before
you different experiences

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that your soul will go through
in the upcoming life in order

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.425 align:middle line:90%
for you to learn and to expand.

00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And each soul comes back
with different soul lessons.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.199 align:middle line:84%
So one soul might come back
to learn about forgiveness.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the
lessons in their life

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.545 align:middle line:84%
might be situations where
you have to forgive somebody.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:90%
How many have had that lesson?

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Hello, all raise your hands.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness, right?

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness, it's a big one.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a big soul lesson.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Compassion, another one.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Compassion.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Having a passion.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.516 align:middle line:84%
When someone does you wrong,
what's the right thing to do?

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Turn around, have compassion.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we never know what
that person's backstory is.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a history.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.336 align:middle line:84%
And we really should not judge
somebody, because sometimes we

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
don't know what
their history is.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So compassion is
another soul lesson.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness,
compassion, and what's,

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.445 align:middle line:84%
of course, the number
one soul lesson

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that we come back to
learn and to experience?

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.085 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Love.

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Love.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Love is our natural
soul's energy.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural soul's
language, is love.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.749 align:middle line:84%
And love-- see, I'm
going to crying now

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about
love-- because love

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is such a high
vibrational frequency.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Energy basically means
molecules that vibrate or move

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:90%
at a certain rate of speed.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You are made-- your
soul is made of love.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's way beyond
this personality.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:90%
You encompass everything.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:90%
That is pure love.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Love permeates everything.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Love is God, and God is love.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
believe in a religious god,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe God is
everything, omnipresent.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I believe God should be-- I
think God should be the word--

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:90%
the initials ONE.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
God-- omnipresent
nurturing energy.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
what I believe God is.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:90%
I think God is everything.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I think God is way beyond
the human comprehension.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And you as soul will
really come back lifetime

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
to lifetime to learn your
soul lessons and to really,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:84%
if you will, integrate
that loving energy,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
that God energy into your
soul in each lifetime.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, very important, to
recognize that soul's energy,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that God love, that one
love in every single person

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:90%
who you meet upon your path.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.156 align:middle line:90%
Cool, huh?

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:08.974 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:10.515 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's
time for your soul

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:12.944 align:middle line:84%
to graduate-- because this
is really our school room.

00:05:12.944 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:90%
We come back to learn.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.276 align:middle line:84%
Our soul comes back here to
learn many lessons, of course,

00:05:16.276 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
to perfect lessons, soul
lessons, if you will.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you pass
those lessons in a lifetime.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes you may not.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
We're always given-- in our
blueprint of that life--

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
we're always given
a various situation.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It will show itself, a
scenario will show itself.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But we all have
the free will, how

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
we're going to deal
with that situation.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to use
love for a situation,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:90%
or are we going to use fear?

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
It is up to your soul
to decide which one.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
lifetimes of experiences

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
will ignite your soul to
use the right choi-- make

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
the right choice
using love not fear.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.245 align:middle line:84%
It seems we use fear-- it's
false ego appearing real.

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:90%
I talk about this all the time.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes as humans,
we get caught so much up

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:84%
in the human self that we get
caught up in the fear self.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's not, as I
said, your true self.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Your true self is soul.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:90%
That's your love.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Love is soul, soul is love.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So today as we
come together, you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.591 align:middle line:84%
come here with lots of
lifetimes of experiences.

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Everybody watching
this and everybody here

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:84%
in the audience, everyone
here is different.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
You might be sisters, you
might be husband and wife,

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
you might have come
together as friends.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But every single
person is unique.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And every single person
has their own blueprint.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I often think that the soul is
also the fingerprint of God.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I like to say that as well.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Each one is unique.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Each soul is very
unique and each self

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
comes back with its gifts,
its abilities, its lessons.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
what it's about.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I contact
other souls, you

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
have to realize that the soul--
part of the soul is the mind.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So at death what
happens, the brain

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:90%
dies with the physical body.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the brain is part
of the physical body.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.067 align:middle line:84%
So what continues on
is the mind-- the mind,

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
which stores all the
memories, all the

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
experiences you ever had in
this three-dimensional physical

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So when souls wish to
communicate through me, what

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.320 align:middle line:84%
happens is I open
myself up to a soul.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Whichever soul comes in,
I'll just open myself up

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and the soul will
walk into my space.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And they will start to
transmit, if you will,

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:84%
information-- memories,
emotions, feelings,

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.484 align:middle line:84%
the memories of
scenes that you used

00:07:28.484 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to live that that
soul experienced

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:90%
with you, with your soul.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The connections that you
have, the relationships

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
soul-to-soul communication.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the soul
mind-- their mind--

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
is communicating with
my mind, sending me

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:90%
thoughts and feelings.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's soul-to-soul
communication.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And I am going to communicate
with the discarnate soul, which

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
means they're out of this
physical, three-dimensional

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:90%
They're beyond that.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.906 align:middle line:84%
So I can also read you, as
far as a soul right now,

00:07:58.906 --> 00:08:00.530 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going to
do in a few seconds,

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and see what it's
like as I can tell,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
your soul, the essence of your
being, the purity of who you

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
are, maybe abilities and gifts
that I see but you're not

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:90%
aware of yet.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do that
in a few seconds.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.293 align:middle line:84%
So before I start
that, I'm going

00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
to do a soul-to-soul reading.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Before we do that, any
questions before we start?

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.343 align:middle line:90%
You have a question.

00:08:20.343 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
you were talking

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:90%
about the soul blueprints.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Do you
get that as you're

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
transitioning from
dying to the next step?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:90%
So what happens is this.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Before you come back
into this incarnation--

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
so before you came
back to birth--

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
you really sat down with your
counselors and your spirit

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
guides, and you really
looked at your life

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that you've just lived--
or the lifetimes you just

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
lived-- which brought you
up to a certain point.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And you see the lessons
that you learned

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and the ones you didn't learn.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in another
lifetime, oh, I should

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
have should show more
compassion at one point.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, I should have been
more trusting at one point.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.536 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, I should have loved
myself a little more.

00:08:57.536 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, you may have
to come back in this lifetime

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:90%
to perfect that.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's the blueprint
that you set up.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a curriculum
that your guides, your teachers

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
help you set up-- you
being the student--

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and they help you set
up in this lifetime

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.605 align:middle line:84%
and look at the various
scenarios, and so forth.

00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
what I was wondering

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.352 align:middle line:84%
is I saw somebody a couple
weeks before they passed away.

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And their mouth
was opening and closing,

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
and the hospice people were
saying that that happens.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
wonder if they're

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:41.162 align:middle line:84%
doing some kind of talking with
God, going over their next--

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In that
kind of what you're

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
saying-- reassessing
their lives.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: From
my understanding,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
it's when we leave the
physical body in totality--

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that the so-called dead, that
they're no more a sense of life

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
in that physical shell-- it's
when you're in the other world.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
It's in the spirit
world, after you've

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.485 align:middle line:84%
had your memorial
service and your funeral,

00:09:59.485 --> 00:10:01.068 align:middle line:84%
then you go to the
other side of life.

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
have a life review

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.490 align:middle line:90%
and you see different things.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be a little bit of
time spent in the spirit world.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't come right
back, many times.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:84%
Most times you spend over
there, that's our home.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%
This is not our home.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.233 align:middle line:84%
And most of us don't want
to come right back here.

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Would any of you want
to come right back here?

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.738 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:10:15.738 --> 00:10:16.732 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:84%
In 30 years, I've
never had a spirit say,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I want to come back.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:90%
I miss that body.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I miss that disease,
I miss the sickness.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Never once.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So we really don't
rush back here.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
It seems sometimes the souls
that come back earlier seem

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to be the ones either suicide or
maybe children that die early.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
They tend to come back
earlier, it seems.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.894 align:middle line:84%
But most of us want
to stay over there.

00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go from our next life,
we'll see what's before us.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.806 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also
want to point out-- thank

00:10:42.806 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
you very much-- I also want
to point to a lot of you,

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.337 align:middle line:84%
many people talk about
soul mates and soul groups.

00:10:47.337 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know someone
over here was going

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to ask a question
about soul mates.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I know you were because
I'm psychic, right?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.209 align:middle line:84%
You were going to
ask that question.

00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:55.374 align:middle line:90%
I knew you were.

00:10:55.374 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll answer it for you
without even asking it.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.206 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:10:58.206 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So many people think,
you know, soul mates--

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:90%
do I have a soul mate?

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do have a soul mate.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And many people think of a
soul mate as just one soul.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It's someone you could be
married to, or as a partner,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:11.490 align:middle line:90%
or so forth.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily true.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:84%
A soul mate or soul
mates, as I should say,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
are those souls who you've
shared many lifetime

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
experiences with.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
You've come back and
learned many lessons with.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:84%
You've taken many
classes together.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And you really have an
affinity with each other

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
because you've learned together
over the many eons of time.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.621 align:middle line:90%
So those are soul mates.

00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And you know that.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when you met somebody--
and a lot of-- everybody here,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in your lifetime, you met
somebody and you feel,

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
oh, I know that person.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I know them
from the inside out.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.394 align:middle line:84%
There's a connection I
have with that person.

00:11:41.394 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And also places
that you've been.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
You go to certain locations,
like, I've been here before.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I feel a connection here.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had that happen more
with friends, that connection,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:90%
than necessarily with family.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
They feel very much--
you've had that.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:90%
They feel like, oh, I know them.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:90%
They're part of me.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:90%
That's a soul mate.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to come
back-- when we're

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
researching our
incoming life-- we

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:90%
tend to-- hold on, slow down.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Spirit's already coming in.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
They're already
lined up behind me.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
If they push me off
the stage, you'll know.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is we tend to
come back with our soul mates,

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
but soul groups also.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So soul groups are family
members and friends,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and those beings--
those souls-- who

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.723 align:middle line:84%
choose to come back
and have lifetimes

00:12:23.723 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:90%
with-- lifetimes of experiences.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And each lifetime, we
take on different roles

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in that soul group.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.195 align:middle line:84%
So not only can you
evolve-- your soul

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:33.560 align:middle line:84%
can evolve individually--
but you also

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:90%
evolve as a group, soul group.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So in one lifetime,
you might be the mother

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.224 align:middle line:84%
and that person might
be the daughter or son.

00:12:40.224 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Another lifetime, they'll be the
child, you'll be the parents.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:90%
You switch roles.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much
like Shakespeare said,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the world is a stage and
we're merely players upon it.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:90%
That's really the way it is.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So start looking at
yourself as a soul having

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
a human experience, not
the other way around,

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's
really, really true.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Another one more question?

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:01.557 align:middle line:90%
Yes, young lady.

00:13:01.557 --> 00:13:03.598 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to stand
up and ask your question?

00:13:03.598 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So in the
realm of soul groups,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.174 align:middle line:84%
can that include a
pet in your family?

00:13:07.174 --> 00:13:08.673 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
for sure, animals.

00:13:08.673 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:10%
Of course they're
souls, of course.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:10%
And you souls have been
together in lifetimes.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:10%
Now have you been an
animal in another lifetime

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.579 align:middle line:10%
that's been a human?

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
doing this work,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.205 align:middle line:84%
I used to think that there's a
separate kingdom for animals--

00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:84%
there's animal souls--
and a separate kingdom

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.466 align:middle line:90%
for physical, human souls.

00:13:25.466 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I
thought for a long time.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And I asked a friend
of mine about that,

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:90%
or I was talking about it.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And my friend, who is
also a healer, and she

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:90%
said, why do you limit the soul?

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Why can't a soul be part
of that animal, the soul

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:90%
be part of you?

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And she said, think of it like
water and that water permeates

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.680 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So why can't part
of your soul be

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:90%
part of that animal right now?

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And that animal be part of you.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I have two wonderful children--
two four-legged furry animals.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Boo Radley and Maisy May,
who I show on my Facebook

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:90%
They're my children.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.702 align:middle line:90%
And I know when I--

00:13:55.702 --> 00:13:57.160 align:middle line:84%
once I had-- there
was an accident,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I went to see-- I saw
this animal get killed,

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:90%
hit by a car.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.951 align:middle line:90%
And I was really distraught.

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And spirit said to
me, there's going

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to be an animal sent your way
that's going to help you heal.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I went down to the pound
there and I found Maisy May.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was really weird, as
it usually is when it's truth.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that when I
went down to the last kennel--

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the last cage-- I look
and there's little

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.137 align:middle line:84%
Maisy May with her
white furry self.

00:14:22.137 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And she rolled over and
showed me her belly.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I knew right away there
was an instant connection.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.996 align:middle line:84%
There was a soul connection
that I had with that dog.

00:14:28.996 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
she really did

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.630 align:middle line:84%
help save me as far as
healing me with that situation

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that I witnessed several
weeks before when

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
I saw a dog get killed.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And so I always feel that.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the more you can tune
into your soul self--

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that essence of
being-- you really then

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
become aware of that soul
essence in every living thing.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So the other day I was
at a store checking out,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and there was an ant-- a little
ant-- walking on the platform

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And the cashier
said, oh, an ant.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes, how
lovely that ant is.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't kill it-- because you
immediately want to kill it.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%
We're part of that soul.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:90%
That soul's part of us.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have to start thinking
that way maybe, and changing

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts and
realizing that we're

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:90%
a part of that soul essence.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.925 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:90%
That explains a lot for me.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Explains a lot, right?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It's something to
think about, for sure.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So to show you how this works,
that I'm going to-- I just

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
want to start with doing
a soul-to-soul reading.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Which means that
my soul is going

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to read the
incarnate-- your soul

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:84%
within this physical
body-- and is just

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:90%
going to start with that.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.442 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:15:29.442 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so you wanted a
soul-to-soul reading, yes?

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and
what is your name?

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Diana.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So Diana.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So let me just connect with
you on a soul-to-soul level.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So as I read your soul, and
I intuitively read your soul,

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.634 align:middle line:90%
my soul reads your soul.

00:15:39.634 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you that in this
lifetime when you've come back,

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.817 align:middle line:84%
your soul's come back-- you've
always been a people person.

00:15:44.817 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Can I just say that?

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And you've always been a people
person in other lifetimes

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
You've been before
people, around people,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes, in
front of the scenes.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And something which you really
have worked on on a soul level

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:90%
is empathy.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hm.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.001 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is empathy.

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:10%
Empathetic work.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you would
have had very much an ability

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and a gift, if you
will call it that,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.554 align:middle line:84%
to feel about other people
empathetically, yes?

00:16:07.554 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And to
feel sorrow and to be

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:90%
emotional with other people.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:84%
In as much as in this
current lifetime,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.710 align:middle line:84%
you've had to learn
how to defend yourself

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:90%
as far as feeling too much.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Absolutely, isn't it?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.686 align:middle line:84%
Because I know as you're young
girl, as a young girl first

00:16:21.686 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
coming into this physical body--
and I'd say really around two,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
three, four, five years of age--
I'm always-- I'm totally open.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm completely open.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling programs.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling energy
from everywhere I look.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.369 align:middle line:84%
And I got to learn
how close it down.

00:16:33.369 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Mommy, Mommy, help me, help me.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what to
do because I'm so open.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling things
left and right.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:10%
There would definitely have
been a love for animals as well,

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.310 align:middle line:10%
and because animals
are unconditional love.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:10%
Yeah?

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.224 align:middle line:10%
And you really are an
unconditional loving person.

00:16:45.224 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:10%
Around the age of seven
or eight years of age,

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.890 align:middle line:10%
unfortunately, you had to shut
down to that essence of truth

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:10%
and start listening to what
was expected of you, like most

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:10%
of us do in this life.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But you're also
extra empathetic.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Can I say that.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I would like to say with
you, you closed down empathy,

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.418 align:middle line:84%
but you also could
open it up right away.

00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
If you took a class in psychic
development, intuition,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:90%
open right up.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Because you're very intuitive.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:90%
You're very sensitive.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:84%
You're also a gifted
writer, so you

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
would like to express yourself
with the written word.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely, yes.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
you've have lifetimes

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
of expressing yourself
in the written word.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And also you would have
lifetime-- maybe not

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
in this current
one-- that definitely

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
would have been a
lifetime with color,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.824 align:middle line:84%
working with color and
art and aesthetics.

00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, especially.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.458 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know you've come back

00:17:24.458 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
with a sense of design.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.772 align:middle line:84%
And you could have had a
choice in your soul's career

00:17:28.772 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime
where there'd want

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:84%
to be the empathetic self
working with that, working

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.294 align:middle line:84%
with people, whether it's going
to be through medical work.

00:17:35.294 --> 00:17:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Understand, so you
could have gone

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to college about
medical work or thought

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
about being in that
healing arts field.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.775 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.529 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that you come in
with that, as far as the soul

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:45.930 align:middle line:90%
gift, the soul ability you have.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.494 align:middle line:84%
And that's going
to stay with you.

00:17:47.494 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
You've been-- many
lifetimes you've been there

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:84%
in the healing arts, but
also psychology as well.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.231 align:middle line:84%
There could have been--
You understand that.

00:17:54.231 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:10%
So you could have
done that as well.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.750 align:middle line:10%
And I would say in
this current lifetime,

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:10%
your soul needs to express
itself to feel fully

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.780 align:middle line:10%
fulfilled in working
with the healing arts,

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:10%
in working with people,
empathy, helping people out

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:10%
realize who they are.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:10%
You understand that.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And I know that you have a very
strong sense-- your soul has

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:10%
a very strong sense
of you, who I am.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is with
your soul, when you--

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.675 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I take
that as validation.

00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:22.805 align:middle line:84%
Because I know if someone
tells you differently,

00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and they don't see you for
who you are, you're like,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
excuse me, that
doesn't work for me.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:90%
That's not who I am.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know in prior lifetimes,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.790 align:middle line:84%
can I say it that way, that
you've had to defend your soul.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.847 align:middle line:84%
You defend who you are and
who you were in many times--

00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:90%
in your station, your situation.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And you've had to defend that.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:90%
And in this lifetime, no way.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
They either love me for
who I am, or bye bye.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:90%
I am who I am.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.741 align:middle line:84%
I'm centered in who I am
and that's who you are.

00:18:48.741 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Does
that make sense?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, thank you.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.925 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:52.925 --> 00:18:54.104 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

00:18:54.104 --> 00:18:54.770 align:middle line:90%
You can applaud.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:55.270 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.956 align:middle line:90%
Good energy.

00:18:55.956 --> 00:18:58.303 align:middle line:90%
Not for me, but for her.

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:01.627 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to-- Let's go
over here with this lady here.

00:19:01.627 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if I give you a
quick soul-to-soul-- oh, great.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:90%
My name's Katie.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Katie.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, Katie.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Very nice.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you're here.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.808 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think you
were going to be here,

00:19:09.808 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
but you're here,
which is important.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So interesting.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
When your soul's come back
in this current lifetime,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I know family would have
been a major lesson for you.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:90%
So you've come back in a family.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if
when you were younger,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:84%
there was a separation
of family and you

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.620 align:middle line:84%
had to redefine family
in your own way?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:27.915 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:19:27.915 --> 00:19:29.706 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when
you were a young girl,

00:19:29.706 --> 00:19:32.365 align:middle line:84%
you come in as a
teacher to the family.

00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:90%
I just got to say that.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're also a
very unique blueprint,

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in that you do
things your own way.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the family
looks to you for decisions.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
You came here as a very
mental type of person.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Decision making,
decision making.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're somebody
also that the colors

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:84%
of your soul, there's a lot of
red, which is lot of energy.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
There's also a lot of
yellow, which tells me

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're a very
mental processor.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:84%
That you think, you think,
you think before you act.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like, I have to
be very careful at what I do,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.919 align:middle line:90%
what I say before I do it.

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
process that you're

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
working through your mind
and through your head.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:06.585 align:middle line:90%
And you're a thinker.

00:20:06.585 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Can I say that?

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:07.755 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:07.755 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I'll also tell you

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.068 align:middle line:84%
that your soul came back
in this lifetime-- one

00:20:11.068 --> 00:20:16.442 align:middle line:84%
of the interesting lessons was
not to be so self critical.

00:20:16.442 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Make sense?

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That makes
a lot of sense, yeah.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know as your soul comes back

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime as
critical or self critical,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.786 align:middle line:84%
that it's put you in a
bad situation sometimes.

00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:27.285 align:middle line:90%
Limitation.

00:20:27.285 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Can I say a limited
way of living.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%
A limited reality.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:32.884 align:middle line:90%
Can I just say that to you?

00:20:32.884 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
it's almost like,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember that
thoughts are things,

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:84%
and you created that reality
based upon self imposed,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:90%
because of your critical self.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.945 align:middle line:84%
And I also want you to know
that in this lifetime--

00:20:43.945 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's a hard one for you, a
lesson, a very hard soul lesson

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.179 align:middle line:84%
for you-- to really find your
voice and to express yourself.

00:20:50.179 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
got to be very, very--

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're afraid, fearful
to express yourself.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can't do that.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.344 align:middle line:84%
Now, and would I be
correct if I would

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:03.093 align:middle line:84%
say to you that your
mother and father had

00:21:03.093 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:90%
a separation of some kind?

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Would they get married in
the late '40s or early '50s?

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.845 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Early '50s.

00:21:07.845 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Early '50s.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.442 align:middle line:90%
Great, like '52 or something.

00:21:10.442 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle line:90%
That sounds right.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because as
I look at that soul group

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that you've come
in with, I tell you

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
that they're
together by a thread.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.395 align:middle line:90%
They go in and they go out.

00:21:19.395 --> 00:21:20.850 align:middle line:90%
They're together by a thread.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say that
there's true love there,

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but a bit of the personality
has gotten in the way.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The impersonalities
have gotten in the way.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
just say that, OK.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can't be
everything to everyone.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.707 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:32.914 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Honor yourself.

00:21:32.914 --> 00:21:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Make sense to you?

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.075 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You got
to honor yourself.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can't be what
people want you to be.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be who you are.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the major soul lessons
you've come back to learn

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:45.174 align:middle line:84%
is really about expressing
who you are and honoring that.

00:21:45.174 --> 00:21:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely, great.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't be afraid.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So you're definitely
learning a lot lessons

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.279 align:middle line:90%
in your soul about fear.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:52.275 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:52.915 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Fantastic.

00:21:52.915 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you sweetheart.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Appreciate it.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.584 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:21:55.584 --> 00:21:57.894 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:57.894 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
so what I'd like

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to do with you now
is a soul meditation.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:84%
A soul meditation,
where you will actually

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:84%
start to experience
and have a relationship

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
with your inner soul, the
inner essence of your being.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.602 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:10.602 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you've never meditated
before, do not worry about it.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
focused awareness.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'd just like you
to close your eyes.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And you at home as well,
you can close your eyes

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and just listen to the
music behind my voice.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the sound my voice.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Perfect, perfect.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And just with the
intention that you have,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
just to explore and
to be open, to go

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:37.365 align:middle line:84%
through the seas and the waves
of who you are as a soul who

00:22:37.365 --> 00:22:39.540 align:middle line:84%
have traveled many,
many lifetimes,

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
many, many places
to be here today.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Your soul has, definitely.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Just connect, please, with
the sound of my voice.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect to
the sound of my voice,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:84%
it is probably a voice
you've heard many times,

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:84%
in many lifetimes,
where you definitely

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
can feel or recognize the
tone of the voice you've

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
heard many times,
many lifetimes.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And just as you listen
to the sound my voice,

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
become mindful of your
feet on the floor.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of your
legs, your backs

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:84%
on the chairs, your
shoulders and your arms,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:90%
your neck and your head.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And just be aware
as a soul being,

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
you are so much more than
just this human shell.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Your soul has lived.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:90%
There is no death.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:84%
There's just expressed
life in many ways.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Your soul is also part of
a multi-vast dimension,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
multi-universes,
multi-dimensions.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.445 align:middle line:84%
And just be aware of
that at this moment.

00:23:42.445 --> 00:23:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
We are part of a lovely,
lovely world of light,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.690 align:middle line:90%
of golden light.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Some call it the
spiritual dimensions.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But you right now exist
in many, many levels.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But together, let's connect
that golden light dimension.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So with your mind, the great
creator, the mind, the soul--

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
the soul has done
this many times--

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:84%
let's use our
imagination and envision

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
a bright, bright golden
light far, far above us.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
As far as you can imagine
is this golden light.

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And feel the warmth of the
spiritual, golden light

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
for it's a greater world, a
greater realization, a greater

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
dimension, and the
essence of we are.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And just right now,
as you hear my voice,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:84%
imagine a string of
this golden light--

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:84%
a cord of this golden light
dropping down and connecting

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:90%
with the top of your head.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And as this golden light--
this cord of golden light

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
drops down into the
head, it fills up

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
your body-- the human body--
with this golden light,

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:84%
bathing every cell
with golden light,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
every muscle with golden light,
every organ with golden light

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath,
and exhale and let go.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.244 align:middle line:84%
Let go so you can open up
those veils and receive more.

00:25:25.244 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And again.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And inhale that golden light.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Let go of all the old stuff.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Open up those veils.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Open up those doorways to
the essence of your being.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And then one more
time and inhale.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Hold it-- two, three, four.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just would
like you to stay

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:84%
in the position
right in your heart.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:90%
The heart.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a center
of your soul being,

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:90%
right there in the heart.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And just among yourself,
just feeling, no judgment,

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:90%
no judgement whatsoever.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Just be in that heart
space, in your soul space.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And begin to communicate
with your soul.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.440 align:middle line:90%
With your soul.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you communicate
with your soul,

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
let it bring to you and
to human comprehension

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
the essence of your soul,
the gifts of your soul.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The limitations the human
places upon its soul.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Feel the emotional
aspect of your soul.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit in
this space, also

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:90%
become aware of the human level.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.710 align:middle line:84%
What lessons is your soul
learning in this lifetime?

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:84%
What soul lessons
have you decided

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
to come back and learn
in this lifetime?

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And just let that drop
into your consciousness,

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.938 align:middle line:90%
drop into your mind.

00:27:11.938 --> 00:27:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And just sit with
that and enjoy.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Enjoy the revelation, for the
knowledge is always there.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
open up the door.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.380 align:middle line:84%
They're a truth
to our awareness.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And let the soul express in
our thoughts, in the mind,

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
to reveal those lessons
it's come back to learn.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And as we sit within
that space and you

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.560 align:middle line:84%
become so aware of the
revelations of the lessons

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.760 align:middle line:84%
you've come back in this
current lifetime to learn,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.090 align:middle line:84%
we ask divine
heavenly parent, we

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:84%
ask your blessing upon
this meeting today.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to me.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends,
speak clear to me.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Give us glimpses of eternity.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Let us know that you are free.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Give us names and
facts and places.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Help us to understand
heaven's graces.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Send your thoughts upon me
with emotion and simplicity,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
as we sit together in
peace, love, harmony.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And thank your soul.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate your soul.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Love your soul.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
You've come back to
this human level.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard school.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Give yourself credit.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself a pat on the back
for taking these challenges

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:90%
in this human school.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy, but
you're doing it.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:90%
You're doing it.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.595 align:middle line:90%
So give yourself credit.

00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know everyone
at home who's

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
watching this definitely
got something,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
because I could feel it.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.294 align:middle line:90%
I got something.

00:29:21.294 --> 00:29:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And everybody here
in the audience

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.565 align:middle line:90%
I bet you all got something.

00:29:24.565 --> 00:29:25.065 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I could tell-- you
kind of went uuuuh deep, deep

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.920 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And did anybody have
any lessons that you

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:84%
were, that surprised
you at all, that

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:84%
came to the surface of your
mind that you didn't expect?

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.962 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:29:38.962 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:90%
What did you get?

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I got that, as much as I think
I've worked on forgiveness,

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
boy, I have a ways to go still.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:90%
It's our school room here.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're always working,
we're always learning.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.545 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, really
true-- I'm learning it, too.

00:29:54.545 --> 00:29:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning it, too,
It's a day-to-day thing.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And if, again, if you get
back into that essence,

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:84%
of that sense of "I'm a soul,
and my soul is learning.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:90%
My soul."

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And the forgiveness
thing is hard,

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.000 align:middle line:90%
but it really does matter.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
If you could start
looking at it by saying,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to treat that person
as I want to be treated.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.910 align:middle line:90%
So maybe they didn't understand.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was a wrong message.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they didn't
mean to do that.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.571 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's something
in their background

00:30:20.571 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that caused them to manifest
this in a certain way.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be better than.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be higher-- look
at it from a higher way.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Take the high road.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Less traffic.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, that's right.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
it's really true.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.679 align:middle line:90%
And forgiveness-- great lesson.

00:30:35.679 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us are learning
forgiveness, that soul lesson.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think the number
one way of learning

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.876 align:middle line:84%
that is number one,
being aware of it.

00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:90%
So you're aware of it

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.035 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:30:45.035 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Which is great.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Again, that could be the entire
reason why you're here today.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That could be it.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That might be it.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this
will continue with you

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.884 align:middle line:90%
when you leave these doors.

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It will continue with you when
you finish turning this off,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:90%
it will continue with you.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.656 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So what
I'd like to do now

00:30:59.656 --> 00:31:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is I'd like to
step into my soul.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to have
another soul come forward to me

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.990 align:middle line:90%
and present themselves to you.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see who comes in.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that all right?

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So as I step into
my soul self, I'm

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.541 align:middle line:84%
going to be aware that
a man comes in here.

00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:16.790 align:middle line:84%
This man feels like a father
figure coming close to me

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:90%
on this side of me.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And I must go with, I'm
not feeling very, very

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.790 align:middle line:90%
good toward my end of my life.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:27.016 align:middle line:84%
I know that this is brand new
for me as far as communicating.

00:31:27.016 --> 00:31:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's coming to
the side of the room

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:84%
so, again, this is what
I'm feeling from this man.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.720 align:middle line:90%
And I know I'm a father here.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know this man
wants me to talk

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:39.665 align:middle line:84%
about a specific hat or a cap
that he has-- that he had.

00:31:39.665 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know there'd
be a photograph of me

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.330 align:middle line:90%
with this hat or this cap on.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very aware of that.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.569 align:middle line:84%
I'm also aware of
this man's eating,

00:31:47.569 --> 00:31:49.110 align:middle line:84%
he's telling me that
the eating would

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.090 align:middle line:84%
have been limited
before he passes

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of life, that
the eating would be limited.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't eat that much,
and he can have as much food

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.570 align:middle line:90%
as he likes right now.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware that I
want to do things in his name.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
that, it's very strange.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I know April is very
significant when

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm connecting
with this gentleman

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
I'm going to go.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.392 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go over
to this side of the room.

00:32:09.392 --> 00:32:11.266 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm back
here with this lady.

00:32:11.266 --> 00:32:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Did your dad pass over, please?

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: May I come to you?

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So you understand about
your dad passing over.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand then
about the food as well?

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
Or a problem with
eating before he passes?

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He couldn't swallow.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
couldn't swallow.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.774 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
that's significant

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:24.620 align:middle line:90%
when he comes in about the food.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.897 align:middle line:84%
I know there'd tubes with
me at one point as well.

00:32:26.897 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there's
IVs that this man would

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.470 align:middle line:90%
have toward the end of his life.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.400 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that I want

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.561 align:middle line:84%
to talk about-- he wants me
to talk about people coming

00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:37.150 align:middle line:84%
from different
parts of the country

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.767 align:middle line:84%
or to come at the end to
see him at the funeral,

00:32:39.767 --> 00:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
or toward the end of his life
and visit from other parts

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:90%
the country.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
he had have a son?

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:45.035 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a brother?

00:32:45.035 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do have a brother.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
because for some reason,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.620 align:middle line:84%
he wants to talk
about the brother--

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.930 align:middle line:90%
significant about the brother.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when we're
younger, when he was younger,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.070 align:middle line:84%
there were some words exchanged
or some problems there

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:90%
with his soul and your brother.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, the soul of your brother.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.486 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:00.486 --> 00:33:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I would know
that those two guys are so much

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.382 align:middle line:84%
alike in so many ways that they
dislike being so much alike.

00:33:06.382 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And they would see the
other-- each-- characteristics

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.920 align:middle line:90%
of each other within each other.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense to you?

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:11.908 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:11.908 --> 00:33:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And would you also know
that this man, would he

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:84%
be in his early 70s
before-- when he passes?

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: About, like 72?

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:18.205 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Because that's-- and
how old was he then?

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:20.896 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 72.

00:33:20.896 --> 00:33:21.811 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:33:21.811 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just confirming
that it's him

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.870 align:middle line:90%
and that I got him here with me.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's dogs
around with this gentleman.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.998 align:middle line:84%
I know that he had a dog
at the end of his life

00:33:28.998 --> 00:33:30.277 align:middle line:90%
who'd meant something to him.

00:33:30.277 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I know that this
dog, he's telling me,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.360 align:middle line:84%
would have passed over before
him or right before him.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about this.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.165 align:middle line:84%
Did I have to put
a dog to sleep?

00:33:37.165 --> 00:33:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You did.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And was it around the time
of your dad's passing?

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that I have
the dog with me here.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So he's bringing
you the dog, OK?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you felt
this dog earlier today

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:90%
when you were here.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.660 align:middle line:84%
You must have felt the
dog hop up on your lap,

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.980 align:middle line:90%
because the dog was here.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
felt that or not.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.101 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You didn't.

00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:55.510 align:middle line:90%
The dog is definitely there.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And was this your
dog or his dog?

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was my dog.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your dog.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:58.650 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.977 align:middle line:84%
Would you know about having
to do the nails on the dog?

00:34:00.977 --> 00:34:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Trimming them?

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She hated it.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.315 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She hated it.

00:34:03.315 --> 00:34:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But didn't you insist upon
having the nails clean

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning when
you had her cleaned,

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and they had do the nails?

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember that?

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I know that I wanted to say
an appreciation for the dog.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know that at the
end of that dog's life,

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.679 align:middle line:84%
there would have been
either one short leg,

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.179 align:middle line:84%
or something about
the walking would

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.380 align:middle line:90%
have been difficult, correct?

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.819 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, she had
trouble getting up the stairs.

00:34:22.819 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So when she's walking, though,
I know that I'm limping

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.993 align:middle line:90%
or I'm this way.

00:34:26.993 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's the hind legs.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I know that Dad brings
the dog for you.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:33.400 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.962 align:middle line:84%
I would ask also would
there be two females,

00:34:35.962 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:84%
as far as he's talking about
two girls or two ladies.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.064 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if she's
aware of two sisters?

00:34:40.064 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have two sisters.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
So there's two sisters on about.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very aware of that.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that some-- he used
to have a Chevrolet car.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:90%
So I'd say--

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:49.699 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, he
was a cop, yeah.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.196 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was a cop, OK.

00:34:51.196 --> 00:34:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Did he drive a Chevy
when he was a cop?

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: The
undercover car, yeah.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.998 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:54.998 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember
in-- yeah, go on.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So when the soul comes
back, they bring memories.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.728 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask
you, would you know

00:35:00.728 --> 00:35:03.210 align:middle line:84%
about riding in the back
of that car on the side.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.444 align:middle line:90%
Just, Dad, come on.

00:35:04.444 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:84%
He's bringing me a memory
of you riding in the back.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We used to take
the dog to the park in the car.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.555 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:35:09.555 --> 00:35:10.826 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:10.826 --> 00:35:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is the memory that is
coming about with that dog.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that your dad
does have a love of dogs.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.777 align:middle line:90%
I really do know he does.

00:35:16.777 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that
I would have known also

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.318 align:middle line:84%
as this man comes close to me
that he was happy to be dead.

00:35:21.318 --> 00:35:22.165 align:middle line:90%
He's happy be dead.

00:35:22.165 --> 00:35:23.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, I wouldn't
want-- again,

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.956 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want
to come back here.

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:90%
He's very interesting.

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And he never really would have
believed in life after death

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.046 align:middle line:84%
But I got to tell you,
he certainly does now.

00:35:32.046 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise he couldn't do this.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's--
who was Catholic?

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's Catholic.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a funeral mass
for your father when he died?

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We did.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.859 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hmm.

00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's
someone with the name of an "M"

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.009 align:middle line:84%
name also that's
significant here.

00:35:48.009 --> 00:35:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So there would be a
woman with an "M" name.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.425 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
I'm with a Margaret

00:35:51.425 --> 00:35:53.574 align:middle line:90%
or Mary or this sort of a name?

00:35:53.574 --> 00:35:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm
in the spirit world.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the side of
life, not on this side.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hmm.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Margarette.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:59.471 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Margarette.

00:35:59.471 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Is that his mother?

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mary's his mother.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mary's his mother.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And she's on the
other side, isn't she?

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:84%
See, the spirit world
does their part.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We have trouble-- The
living has to do their part.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So the soul of Mary,
his connection to her,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
would be also coming in here
as far as-- very interesting.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I see that, and
you understand, acknowledge,

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.935 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming so close
to me, I see like a horizon,

00:36:21.935 --> 00:36:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful lights
all around you.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know this lady
Mary-- you might never

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.935 align:middle line:84%
had a great relationship or
really known her very well.

00:36:28.935 --> 00:36:31.310 align:middle line:84%
The lady, you wouldn't have
known her very well, did you?

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She died
when I was a baby.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So you would not have
known her very well,

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.195 align:middle line:90%
she's going on about.

00:36:35.195 --> 00:36:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And she wants me to know
that when she was alive,

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:84%
she would be a stay-at-home
mom or a house woman,

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.170 align:middle line:84%
of crafts, sew buttons, and
sewing things all the time.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:90%
That would be her thing.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said, stop
doubting-- what?

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Stop doubting your-- ah.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Stop doubting your
own soul's journey

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and stop doubting
who you're with,

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.625 align:middle line:84%
or the situation you're
with right now in your life.

00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:59.808 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because she said, you

00:36:59.808 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:84%
are where you're supposed to
be and stop doubting that.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that there
would be accommodation

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
from your father in
the police uniform.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:90%
And there'd be a picture of him.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know he would be
receiving something,

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
receiving an accommodation
or something.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
very proud of that.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:14.873 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're--
she's telling me--

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the grandma's tell me that
and he's, oh, thank you.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:90%
He's very proud, too.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And you and your
sister definitely

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
need to get together
and be connected.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.154 align:middle line:90%
Is this your child over here?

00:37:26.154 --> 00:37:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.595 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
his granddaughter?

00:37:27.595 --> 00:37:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Both of them or one?

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My niece.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.781 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Niece.

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So I know that they come over
here, too, as well as for you.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I know you either want to
write or do some more writing,

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:84%
or do something
expressing yourself.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Make sense to you?

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.436 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:38.965 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So continue writing and
you will go to college.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
college is coming in.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been
thinking about that

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to happen.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you at that, OK?

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you every much.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: God bless.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.100 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to come here.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Your name is?

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Laurie.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Laurie,
would you mind standing.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Can I come to you, please?

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:54.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So your father's
passed over, correct?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And your father,
I'm going to talk

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.449 align:middle line:84%
about he had trouble
with one leg.

00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He did.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was there talk
about either getting a leg cut,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:90%
or amputee at one point?

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was he-- was
he in a hospital for a while?

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:07.555 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:07.555 --> 00:38:08.735 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How long?

00:38:08.735 --> 00:38:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A month.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your Dad was
in the hospital for a month.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.468 align:middle line:84%
And was there-- He's talking
to me about being there,

00:38:13.468 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:90%
but he's not aware of himself.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like, he's being
in the hospital or a place

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.825 align:middle line:90%
of being taken care of.

00:38:18.825 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let's
put it that way.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not going to
say totally a hospital,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.004 align:middle line:84%
but a place of
being taken care of.

00:38:23.004 --> 00:38:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.169 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And was it in
a different state, please?

00:38:26.169 --> 00:38:26.835 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:26.835 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't there
another family member

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.114 align:middle line:84%
who was there watching over
him or took care of him?

00:38:32.114 --> 00:38:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would you know
about your dad having a tattoo?

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Uh-huh.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So I know that's significant
when he brings that in.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I know there would have
been time where there would

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.710 align:middle line:90%
have been military in the past.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.345 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:44.053 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he
would have very much

00:38:44.053 --> 00:38:46.234 align:middle line:84%
related to that lifetime
in the military, OK?

00:38:46.234 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.441 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: For
some reason, I know

00:38:48.441 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:84%
your father must come
through here today.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.665 align:middle line:84%
And his soul needs to resolve
some things with you--

00:38:52.665 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.414 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And with
other members of the family.

00:38:55.414 --> 00:38:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So I got to tell
you in some ways,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.034 align:middle line:84%
it isn't necessarily he's
coming for you today,

00:39:00.034 --> 00:39:02.200 align:middle line:84%
but it might be for other
members of the family, OK?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.841 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you know
anyone named Jack or John.

00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:06.684 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A great
uncle of mine.

00:39:06.684 --> 00:39:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: On the
other side with your dad?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.315 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:09.315 --> 00:39:11.356 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
you know if this John was

00:39:11.356 --> 00:39:14.670 align:middle line:84%
at your father's wedding when
your father first got married?

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.094 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I recently
saw their wedding picture.

00:39:17.094 --> 00:39:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:84%
He's just confirming
that you were with him.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
He was watching you do that.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that mom
is having problems

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.010 align:middle line:84%
with her own walking,
her own situation.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.597 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I need to
just rest when I'm walking.

00:39:29.597 --> 00:39:30.430 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know when
you're there in the living room

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.000 align:middle line:84%
as he brings me there,
that I'm walking around

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:90%
and I have to rest a little bit.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.796 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
very, very aware

00:39:38.796 --> 00:39:41.130 align:middle line:84%
also as he brings me into
that living room area

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that there are two sitting rooms
at mom's place where she's at.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a sitting room
which is very important.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I go visit her
there with a television set.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now I know that
when your father comes in,

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.450 align:middle line:84%
he was very relieved when he
passed to the spirit world.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I know there would have been
an operation or surgery ahead

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.110 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.421 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that that was a big deal

00:40:00.421 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:84%
for him and for the family to
go to be witness that surgery,

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now I'm very aware
that he put that surgery off

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.180 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Or he delayed that for
a while, is that right?

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:11.798 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:11.798 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
the odds at the end

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.150 align:middle line:84%
weren't great
after that surgery.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I know that I started going
downhill left that surgery,

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.350 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
he's talking about.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that that
Jack or John person really

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.270 align:middle line:90%
helped him out.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:90%
So I know that.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:25.025 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:40:25.025 --> 00:40:25.649 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:25.649 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I want to also
talk about a porch that's open,

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:90%
an open porch.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And would you have memories,
please, of the open porch?

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.674 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:33.674 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he said you would.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He said you would.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.203 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much, Laurie,
I'll leave with that.

00:40:38.203 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.295 align:middle line:84%
May I come to this
lady here at the end?

00:40:42.295 --> 00:40:44.127 align:middle line:90%
And would you mind standing?

00:40:44.127 --> 00:40:45.293 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I would love it.

00:40:45.293 --> 00:40:46.459 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Take a breath.

00:40:46.459 --> 00:40:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.875 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kathy.

00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kathy.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So Kathy, let me just
tune into around near you.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Great soul.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:90%
You're a great soul, by the way.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:90%
You really give, give, give.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You're a giver and
unfortunately, you

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.630 align:middle line:90%
don't give to yourself.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.620 align:middle line:84%
You're easy giving other
people than yourself.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's someone
in a cancer condition

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.105 align:middle line:90%
when they passed over.

00:41:03.105 --> 00:41:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Is that your mom who had
a cancerous condition when

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:90%
she passes over?

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, she did.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.754 align:middle line:84%
I need to let you know
that your mother wants

00:41:08.754 --> 00:41:11.360 align:middle line:84%
to come in with enthusiasm
and happiness for you.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.964 align:middle line:84%
And she's happy
that you're here.

00:41:12.964 --> 00:41:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm
with a big family.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not a little
family, it's more

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.436 align:middle line:84%
of a bigger family
than a little family.

00:41:17.436 --> 00:41:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Can you understand?

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.886 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to ask, is there
anyone named Lawrence or Larry,

00:41:21.886 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%
or that name in any
sense in the family,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on side
of life or currently?

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.741 align:middle line:84%
But there's a Larry or a
Lawrence would make sense.

00:41:28.741 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.031 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Laurel.

00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:31.185 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, Laurel?

00:41:31.185 --> 00:41:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Laurel.

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Who's that?

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Our niece.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your niece.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.725 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm not sure but this lady
is talking to me about it.

00:41:36.725 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if previously
you went around Laurel,

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
or you saw Laurel, or there
was-- do something with Laurel.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Is there a birthday,
by the way, coming up?

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Or birthday just passed?

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just
passed for Laurel.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And Laurel, right?

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.191 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 16th.

00:41:47.191 --> 00:41:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she's
talking to me about that.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.127 align:middle line:84%
Are you her mother or
friend or-- not mother--

00:41:51.127 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking to this mother.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We're sisters.

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you mind
standing up as well, then,

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:90%
if I bring in your mother?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:56.740 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Jenny.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Jenny.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.116 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk
about, I don't know

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:01.180 align:middle line:84%
if there are two more
of you somewhere around,

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.420 align:middle line:90%
two more siblings around?

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, two brothers.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:03.903 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I understand
that because she

00:42:03.903 --> 00:42:05.986 align:middle line:84%
said there are two more
of my kids running around.

00:42:05.986 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And she has a great
sense of humor.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, she did.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
enthusiastic and I

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:10.935 align:middle line:84%
like working with
her because she's not

00:42:10.935 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:84%
like a, duh-- she's
really enthusiastic.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.670 align:middle line:90%
She's fun.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:90%
She's a fun lady.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.044 align:middle line:90%
She loves-- she's fun loving.

00:42:16.044 --> 00:42:16.960 align:middle line:90%
I gotta tell you that.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.310 align:middle line:84%
She loves music and she
likes to dance a little bit.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So she likes to dance here.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:22.576 align:middle line:84%
She's dancing, I'm going
to tell you that right now.

00:42:22.576 --> 00:42:23.472 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good for you.

00:42:23.472 --> 00:42:24.721 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's loving it.

00:42:24.721 --> 00:42:25.660 align:middle line:90%
She's loving it.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.560 align:middle line:84%
She wants to thank you
for helping her out

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.150 align:middle line:90%
before she passes over.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And I got to thank
you for everything

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:32.580 align:middle line:90%
you did on my behalf.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And your mother is a
lady that kind of like

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.700 align:middle line:84%
does things and, blaa--
and later goes, oops,

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have done that.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.510 align:middle line:84%
She kind of, blaa--
and then phltt.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of
cleaned up after her.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you cleaned
up some stuff after she left.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.840 align:middle line:84%
She said she left you a mess
and you cleaned up after her.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And she said--

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She might say
that but that wasn't true.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she
meant like figuratively.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.908 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if she
had some accounts you

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.540 align:middle line:10%
had to take care of-- some
bank accounts-- and some stuff

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.297 align:middle line:10%
at the house and
some home stuff.

00:43:03.297 --> 00:43:04.547 align:middle line:90%
But I'm-- go on, go on, go on.

00:43:04.547 --> 00:43:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And have you thought about
teaching or was ever a teacher,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.750 align:middle line:84%
or thought about
doing teaching work?

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, very much.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.477 align:middle line:84%
Because she's telling me,
James-- she's saying James.

00:43:14.477 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:84%
She's talking to me
personally, James.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.942 align:middle line:84%
You tell her that one of her
soul's gifts is teaching.

00:43:18.942 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you were
younger, you could

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:84%
have experienced
that, you could have

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:84%
wanted to express
that as your soul.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
that, thank you.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.040 align:middle line:90%
The pearl earrings.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.956 align:middle line:90%
Pearl earrings.

00:43:27.956 --> 00:43:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.345 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand
about the pearl earrings?

00:43:30.345 --> 00:43:32.636 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think she gave
them to me for my wedding.

00:43:32.636 --> 00:43:33.762 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, she did.

00:43:33.762 --> 00:43:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And who was the one that used
to take the photographs, liked

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.550 align:middle line:90%
to take pictures all the time?

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Me.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You did.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:39.955 align:middle line:90%
And don't you have scrapbooks--

00:43:39.955 --> 00:43:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.618 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Of stuff?

00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:45.105 align:middle line:84%
And I know she's talking
to me about that.

00:43:45.105 --> 00:43:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And go on, go on, go on.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:47.590 align:middle line:90%
She was what?

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:51.200 align:middle line:10%
She was watching you
very recently archiving.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.384 align:middle line:10%
Something about archiving
some old photographs.

00:43:53.384 --> 00:43:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
understand that please?

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.138 align:middle line:84%
She's been watching
you trying to archive

00:43:58.138 --> 00:43:59.430 align:middle line:90%
some old photographs.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:03.107 align:middle line:84%
Did you keep some old newspapers
around you, or in storage?

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:03.815 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Some.

00:44:03.815 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Uh-huh.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.389 align:middle line:84%
Where is the storage that you
have, or the boxes in storage?

00:44:07.389 --> 00:44:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In the
basement probably.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:09.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hmm.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.986 align:middle line:84%
And would some of
your photographs

00:44:10.986 --> 00:44:12.410 align:middle line:90%
be in some those boxes as well?

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.234 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
didn't you want

00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to arrange to have some of
those boxes out of the basement

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and brought up to the
other part of the house,

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:20.820 align:middle line:84%
brought upstairs or something
and looking at them.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
want-- she's giving

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot about this
whole thing about I

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.435 align:middle line:84%
want to put it on
DVD, or a disk.

00:44:26.435 --> 00:44:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to have some
stuff on a disk.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.630 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
it make sense to you?

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, and
I'm going to tell you

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.930 align:middle line:84%
when she passes over,
I'm very surprised.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:84%
She's very surprised
when she passes over.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.157 align:middle line:90%
And I got to tell you that.

00:44:39.157 --> 00:44:40.865 align:middle line:84%
And your dad is also
passed over, please?

00:44:40.865 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's on his way.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's on his way.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.211 align:middle line:84%
Because she's talking about
passing him over or helping

00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:90%
passing him over.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:46.804 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:44:46.804 --> 00:44:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
answering your prayers.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you asked her
the other day, Mom, would

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.352 align:middle line:90%
you please help dad over.

00:44:52.352 --> 00:44:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense, please?

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Because she said,
I'm here to help him,

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to help him.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here with his
mother and father.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.170 align:middle line:90%
They're here, too.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.695 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, good.

00:45:00.695 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As a family
there, and they're helping out.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.470 align:middle line:90%
So he's not alone.

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Would you talk about to mom--
yeah, I understand that.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Got it, got it, mom.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:08.920 align:middle line:90%
I understand, mom.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very-- got it.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.420 align:middle line:84%
She's very-- she's
pushing in here.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll get it right, she said.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I will get this right.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I was with you.

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:20.355 align:middle line:84%
You've got some
photos of me out.

00:45:20.355 --> 00:45:21.730 align:middle line:84%
You've got some
photos of me out.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you were putting
them in front of your father

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.740 align:middle line:84%
or try to get dad to
look at some photos.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.572 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:45:27.572 --> 00:45:29.632 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who
was Catholic, please?

00:45:29.632 --> 00:45:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The whole family.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And a Joseph-- Joe or Joseph.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a name incoming
in, Joe or Joseph.

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Would you know that name please?

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uncle Joe.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Uncle Joe
in the spirit world?

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Uh-huh.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know there's a Joseph or
a Joe on the other side helping

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:44.610 align:middle line:90%
him as well.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.351 align:middle line:10%
And I want to tell you, thank
you for helping him over.

00:45:47.351 --> 00:45:48.600 align:middle line:10%
She's right there to help him.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:10%
And fresh flowers.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if he smelled
fresh flowers or roses.

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:84%
But would you
please get him roses

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and put them on the
table next to him?

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.430 align:middle line:90%
And tell him it's from mom.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, very good.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Will do.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We'll do
that and let him know that.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And remember the
conversation we had today

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:06.042 align:middle line:90%
and she's right there with him.

00:46:06.042 --> 00:46:07.916 align:middle line:84%
And she's patting him
on the top of the head.

00:46:07.916 --> 00:46:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And she would do
that all the time.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a sign.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, wonderful.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He keeps
scratching right here.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He keeps
scratching right there

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.410 align:middle line:10%
because she's tapping him
on the top of the head.

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:21.626 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell him, that's her
tapping on the top of the head.

00:46:21.626 --> 00:46:22.417 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:46:22.417 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
Very, very welcome.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.680 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.364 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:27.364 --> 00:46:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want
to talk to somebody

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.830 align:middle line:84%
who had a lady who
took care of them

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.220 align:middle line:90%
when they were a young girl.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.920 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a parent, necessarily,
but somebody took care of them.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Like an aunt or another lady.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
to anybody here?

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.780 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.267 align:middle line:90%
Now that's just you.

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.350 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you, please?

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, please.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.760 align:middle line:90%
And you're connected, right?

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: This is
my daughter, Karen.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:49.976 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:46:49.976 --> 00:46:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:51.935 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lady
here named Mary.

00:46:51.935 --> 00:46:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:53.085 --> 00:46:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's your--

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother
on my mother's side.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.781 align:middle line:84%
And would you know
if this lady wants

00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:02.030 align:middle line:84%
me to talk about game boards,
board games, and checkers?

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And going
back to a memory when

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.595 align:middle line:84%
you were a young girl and
doing these things with games.

00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:07.553 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:47:07.553 --> 00:47:08.275 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:08.275 --> 00:47:09.816 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk
about-- she wants

00:47:09.816 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:84%
me to talk about
a watch, a watch.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So I know she used
to tell you the time,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.314 align:middle line:90%
or teach you the time.

00:47:15.314 --> 00:47:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to go way back now
to when you were a little girl.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't you
spend a lot of time with her?

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A lot of time.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't know
if she lived at your house,

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.330 align:middle line:90%
you lived with her, but--

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just
visited a lot, yes.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:25.078 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:25.078 --> 00:47:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And she taught you time,
she said, on her watch.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.885 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you,
did you recently start

00:47:29.885 --> 00:47:33.280 align:middle line:84%
a new school or a new
course of study please?

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.005 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
became Reiki master.

00:47:35.005 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You became
a Reiki master, very much,

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.090 align:middle line:90%
good, good, good.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I know this
lady is helping you.

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.518 align:middle line:84%
I know she's helping
you very, very much.

00:47:40.518 --> 00:47:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And she's very proud of you, OK?

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.321 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she's
telling me about you having

00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:45.930 align:middle line:84%
a picture of an
angel around you.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.056 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you work in your
studio or wherever you work,

00:47:49.056 --> 00:47:51.680 align:middle line:84%
there must be a picture of some
kind of an angel or some angels

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:90%
where you work.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have a framed one.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes,
and you use that.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:55.965 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She's an artist.

00:47:55.965 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are you an artist?

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever thought
about painting angels

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.040 align:middle line:90%
or painting energy?

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
that's what I do.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
That's what you do.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, there you go.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I know she's
influencing me to tell you that.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:08.565 align:middle line:84%
And this would be
this new course.

00:48:08.565 --> 00:48:09.065 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:48:09.065 --> 00:48:10.164 align:middle line:90%
Right, got it.

00:48:10.164 --> 00:48:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:12.774 align:middle line:84%
So this'll be a new
course of study for you

00:48:12.774 --> 00:48:13.940 align:middle line:90%
or a way of getting into it.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you much.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I will.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:17.250 align:middle line:90%
So you're a natural born healer.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:18.754 align:middle line:90%
Well, healer, healer.

00:48:18.754 --> 00:48:19.254 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:48:19.254 --> 00:48:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, wow.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So this lady Mary is
telling me to tell you

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that your soul's
expressing itself this way.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:26.866 align:middle line:90%
Wow, interesting.

00:48:26.866 --> 00:48:27.365 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:48:27.365 --> 00:48:28.823 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
this-- I'm trying

00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:30.140 align:middle line:90%
to fathom this whole thing.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:84%
She's telling me that
you're being inspired

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.880 align:middle line:84%
as a medium yourself and you
might be using Reiki energy,

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:90%
but guess what?

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're going
to be able to help people

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.120 align:middle line:84%
with the healing
modalities by the colors

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that come through you
and what you paint.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And that that recently,
like two weeks ago,

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.400 align:middle line:84%
that came into your mind that
that's what that was for.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's all coming
together, yeah, healing

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:90%
and art.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Because almost like those
paintings which you put up

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.629 align:middle line:84%
on the wall, or you
put right there.

00:48:58.629 --> 00:49:00.420 align:middle line:84%
If you do that during
one of your sessions,

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.654 align:middle line:84%
they'll get healed by
the colors in that frame.

00:49:02.654 --> 00:49:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.625 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Than just
bringing in the energy this way,

00:49:05.625 --> 00:49:06.450 align:middle line:90%
the universal energy.

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:06.735 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:07.992 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't that wild?

00:49:07.992 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And that just came
through with me.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So whether that person
needs those colors

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.937 align:middle line:84%
in their auric field, you're
going to be knowing it.

00:49:13.937 --> 00:49:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
inspired to receive that.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.525 align:middle line:84%
And someone had to get
some knee surgery done.

00:49:18.525 --> 00:49:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.190 align:middle line:84%
She had a lot of
pain in her knees.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The knee surgery.

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Knees.

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.419 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:24.520 align:middle line:90%
I can walk fine now.

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.550 align:middle line:90%
She can walk fine now.

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.577 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
who George might be.

00:49:28.577 --> 00:49:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: George is my father.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would that
be related to her George?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.302 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her son-in-law.

00:49:33.302 --> 00:49:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that
I've been around--

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:38.349 align:middle line:84%
she's been around
visiting George.

00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:39.390 align:middle line:90%
So she's been around him.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he
might be depressed

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.146 align:middle line:84%
or might be down
for some reason.

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said I'm
helping out with that.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
talk about going

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to the seashore or a
sea, the water or--

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, we love the sea.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.668 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:52.668 --> 00:49:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there's been
talk about you going to a--

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and she's just telling
me there has been,

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.030 align:middle line:90%
she's been around you.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.738 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:58.738 --> 00:50:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Either moving by the
sea, or visiting.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.222 align:middle line:90%
We're still--

00:50:02.222 --> 00:50:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Moving, moving.

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:04.221 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Moving.

00:50:04.221 --> 00:50:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
going to find yourself

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:07.724 align:middle line:84%
in a new scenario, new
situation, she said.

00:50:07.724 --> 00:50:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And it will be by the ocean.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ah, OK.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As you know,
water is very important to you,

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.450 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:13.736 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Water is
very important to you

00:50:13.736 --> 00:50:14.390 align:middle line:90%
and pay attention to it.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:15.910 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you with that, OK?

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank

>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I
want to thank you

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.630 align:middle line:84%
all very much for
joining me today.

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also for
joining me today here.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really important
that we know that, of course,

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost, that you
are a soul expressing yourself

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.879 align:middle line:90%
in this human condition.

00:50:32.879 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully today
through the experiences

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.890 align:middle line:84%
you had today, that you will
realize that, indeed, you

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:40.450 align:middle line:84%
are not alone and
that your soul will

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:43.482 align:middle line:84%
go through this lifetime with
no endings, only beginnings.

00:50:43.482 --> 00:50:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, after today,
you will express yourself

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.750 align:middle line:84%
more as your soul and your
alignment with your soul.

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So thank you all very much.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And love and light until
we see each other again.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:51:09.767 align:middle line:90%
