Hi, everyone.

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:33.293 align:middle line:90%
Hi!

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:34.724 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.592 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for joining me,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and thank you at home
for joining me, also,

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
for "Spirit Talk," where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So on today's show,
a very special show,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
we've had a lot of people
just wondering about one

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
of our previous guests, and
I wanted to bring her back.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So today is all about love
and how you can attract love

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
into your life using what's
called numerology, another tool

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to get to truth.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're very blessed to have a
special guest and a good friend

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:90%
of mine with us today.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%

Hello.

>>VAN PRAAGH: Have

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.192 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now we did a
show with you a while ago,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:90%
and it went really well.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And you have so much
information and so much wisdom.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And you threw things at us.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.573 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people want
to know a little bit more

00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:25.270 align:middle line:90%
about the tool of numerology.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's get started
with that first.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.585 align:middle line:90%
What is numerology?

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: It sounds
like I'm abusive.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
You said, you
threw things at us.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
that's our other life.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.506 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, couple
lawsuits on that one.

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you what this is.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Numerology is the
science of numbers.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It's 2,500 years
old, and Pythagoras

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is the creator of the
system that I use.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The belief is that
everything in the universe

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.366 align:middle line:84%
has vibration,
especially people.

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.198 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
everything in the universe

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:48.409 align:middle line:90%
is measured by numbers.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, actually.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.575 align:middle line:90%
And also, music, harmonics.

00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And music,
the tones, the music, color.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, and if
you hear a song you like,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
chances are its vibrations
are compatible to you.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
If you can't stand
a song, chances

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
are those numbers are
toxic, just like people.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow, that's great.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, when you
meet people, you're like, ooh,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:90%
I like you.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Or you meet someone and
you say, you just drain me.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not feeling good about you.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.505 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I teach.

00:02:09.505 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Raymond on Facebook

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
asked me this question to ask
you, so I got to ask you this.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Is there any correlation
between biblical numbers

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.344 align:middle line:90%
and numerology, like verse 22.2?

00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So tell
us a little about that.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.566 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well,
OK, let's say you

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:90%
talk about the seventh sign.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.597 align:middle line:84%
The number seven
is God's energy.

00:02:26.597 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:90%
That's God's number.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.096 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
this audience today,

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.570 align:middle line:84%
we'll teach maybe
those life paths

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:90%
so everyone knows what they are.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But the number
seven-- when you think

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh sign, the seven
seas, all the spiritual times

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
seven comes up, it's
about test of faith.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's true in
numerology as well.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you talk about
40-- 40 lashings, you know,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:84%
punishment-- fours
learn the hard way.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it's very
connected to the Bible.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to do the
God-numerology connection

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.285 align:middle line:90%
to talk about vibration.

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:55.305 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
your next book should

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
be about numerology
and the Bible.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: It will be.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I-- the problem
for me-- especially,

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
you know my work
forever now, but I'm

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:90%
very spiritual about it.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Numerology is a tool to
help you with your life.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.345 align:middle line:90%
It does not replace God.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And people who panic, they're
like, ooh, it's the occult.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.594 align:middle line:84%
You know, they want to
do that, and I'm like,

00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:90%
are you kidding me?

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It's about being alive and being
happy and treating yourself

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.639 align:middle line:84%
better and the people
in your life better.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:90%
How can that be bad?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's just
having another insight, a tool,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.336 align:middle line:90%
like meditation is a tool.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But when you have
someone's number-- honestly,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
this does go back to no
such thing as a stranger

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.340 align:middle line:90%
if you've got their number.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And they can run,
but they can't hide.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
everybody has a number.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so how did
you get involved in this?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I just want to ask
quickly, for those

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
who don't know, how did you
get involved, in all things,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%
in numerology?

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, my
heart was broken,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.025 align:middle line:90%
and it was my first love.

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:42.108 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In love, OK.

00:03:42.108 --> 00:03:44.705 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Raised Catholic,
so that first love is sacred,

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and I thought we'd
go the distance.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I went to see
a numerologist.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They called her a psychic
because it was so accurate,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:90%
but she was a numerologist.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And when she explained, she
goes, he's toxic to you,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.869 align:middle line:84%
so you really don't
belong with him.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.404 align:middle line:84%
But the mother and
sister are just like you.

00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They share the
number three, which

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
is why, when you
go in that house,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:90%
you feel like you belong there.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the minute I found
that out, I was over him.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Two years of crying over
this man, I was over it.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, that makes sense.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm still friends with the
mom and sister to this day.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
for that reason,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:84%
you just thought, well,
numerology makes sense to me.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: That's when I knew,
when it took me out of pain.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in agony and I
can get out of pain,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't I want the
whole world out of pain.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And let's keep this in mind.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.484 align:middle line:84%
As a three, which is my
number, double three, triple D.

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:26.392 align:middle line:90%
Got to throw it in.

00:04:26.392 --> 00:04:27.754 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:29.327 align:middle line:90%
Got to throw it in.

00:04:29.327 --> 00:04:30.368 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's there.

00:04:30.368 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Might as well.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Boy, are they.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you
what that's all about.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
For me, three is the
natural comedian.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.309 align:middle line:90%
So I used to do the comedy.

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did for a living.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You were a
stand-up comic for many years.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.605 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And making people
laugh was for a minute.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.861 align:middle line:84%
Making you happy for your
life is for your life.

00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
What I do now is to help
you with your lifetime.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let me interrupt
you by asking you this

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
because I think its
a good question.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Laughter itself-- because
I laugh a lot here--

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
is that a certain number?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Laughter?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well,
I would tell you

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that the three is
the natural comedian.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.483 align:middle line:84%
You tend to have a
three in your chart

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
when you're really
good at funny.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
If we look at our
comedians-- even

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Joan Rivers is a
good example of this.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Joan was a three,
born on a three day,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
which means she
could look funny,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:90%
but she was really an eight.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.217 align:middle line:84%
And eights are direct
and can come off as mean.

00:05:12.217 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you'll notice a lot
of things that flew out

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of her mouth, you're like,
wow, Joan, you're mean.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.300 align:middle line:90%
She's like, it was a joke.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It was a joke.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm double three.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So if I go funny,
it stays funny.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:90%
But she was good.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back into her
early career, she was on fire.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
She had a different way--
then it became more critical.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
The number eight-- and this
is true for any eight here--

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.379 align:middle line:84%
you're very judgmental,
judgemental of yourself

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.878 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:05:33.878 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't help but
kind of dissect them,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's what she
did in her comedy.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.520 align:middle line:90%
Tina Fey has a three.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Rosie O'Donnell has a three.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We'll get into
celebrities in just a moment.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, but
I'm just telling you

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
that number three tends to
be in successful comedians.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now when
you say that number,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
she's a three, that means
the day she was born?

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.444 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Well, more than that.

00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
When you take a
full date of birth

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and reduce it to one digit,
you get your life path number.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so let's
stop with that, life path.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, and
we're going to teach you.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can you
give me my life path?

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Of course, but--

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
we're going to-- everybody

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.760 align:middle line:90%
can understand this and

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Do we have
a large board, James?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We
have a large board.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
So give us five minutes, and
we'll get the large board.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to replace
you with a large board.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I'm
sorry to hear that.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I was replaced by
something flat.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.472 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But full.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.257 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: OK, well,
we'll do that because I

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
do want to show how to
break down the numbers

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:90%
so everyone can learn today.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We'll do that now.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.733 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK?

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:22.024 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.024 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, this
is James back with you.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're with
Glynis McCants who's

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:84%
telling us about-- or teaching
us about numbers, numerology,

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:90%
and love by the numbers.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.772 align:middle line:84%
And Glynis is going to
help us figure this out.

00:06:31.772 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
She gave everybody
a piece of paper

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and a pen to write
their numbers out.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Their birth dates, correct?

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.866 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do that for you
here so we see what's going on.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.339 align:middle line:90%
So that's me, JVP.

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:90%
That's my initials.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And you want my birth date.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Your full
date of birth, 8/23--

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.278 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:90%
8/23/1958.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm old.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.533 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: No, you're not.

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:51.240 align:middle line:90%
You're adorable.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.415 align:middle line:90%
Adorable doesn't age.

00:06:53.415 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
You're the age of fabulous.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, fabulous.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: So let's keep going.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.991 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you do.

00:06:57.991 --> 00:07:01.716 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want you to
go 8 plus 2 plus 3.

00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:02.632 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 8.

00:07:02.632 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus--

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.203 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Plus--

00:07:04.203 --> 00:07:04.895 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: 2.

00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:05.561 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 2.

00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 3 plus 1.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Plus 1.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 9

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I got it.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 5 plus 8.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And then, you're
going to add that all up.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No, you're
going to add that up.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't do numbers.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: No, we'll
do it as a class.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Guys, ready?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I do dead people.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.843 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Let's do this, ready?

00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:90%
8 plus 2--

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 10.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.179 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 3.

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 13.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 1.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 14.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 9.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.211 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 23.

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 5.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 28.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.015 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Plus 8.

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 36.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: 36.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:30.776 align:middle line:90%
Now, put 36 here.

00:07:30.776 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, I got it.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And then, 3 plus
6 reduced to one digit is a--

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Nine.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Nine.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Which means James Van
Praagh is an old soul.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:90%
He's a nine.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
my life path number.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.896 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: That
is your life path.

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It's the most important number.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.462 align:middle line:84%
It is the one who comes through
with a lot of information.

00:07:47.462 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if you're
a nine because you're

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:90%
going to relate to this.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.706 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Where
are my fellow nines?

00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:90%
One, two?

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, fellow
nines, look at them.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:90%
And you, raise your hand.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
knew I liked you.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.506 align:middle line:90%
No nines over here?

00:07:57.506 --> 00:07:58.172 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Nine?

00:07:58.172 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, whoever was a nine.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.287 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it goes.

00:08:01.287 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Even as a child, you made
a note of what you liked

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
and what you didn't like so that
when you grew up, it was like,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to let that stuff go.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
That's your biggie
is letting things

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
go because when you're
a nine, you keep it all.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's very true.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.586 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:08:11.586 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but nine
also means people

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
assume you know what's going
on even if you have no clue.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%
You can pull it off.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: True.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And you
know what it is?

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to disappoint.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Nine?

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I'll do it
because they need my help.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't like
letting people down.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.973 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But it is the highest
number in the basic numbers

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:90%
one through nine.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Nine is the number
of completion.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.274 align:middle line:84%
So it's an old
soul, James, which

00:08:32.274 --> 00:08:33.815 align:middle line:84%
makes perfect sense
for you, correct?

00:08:33.815 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK, so that's--

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, give him a hand, he's a 9.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Somebody asked,
do nines get along with nines?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Of course.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
There's respect.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%
You have an instant respect.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
There are numbers that
are called natural match.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.764 align:middle line:84%
You can put those
down if you'd like,

00:08:47.764 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:90%
just because they're simple.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.915 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, hold on.

00:08:50.915 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: They're
really simple.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just give
you three categories.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So life path
is really important to know.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: It's huge.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It's your life purpose.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
If you don't fulfill
that life path number,

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.446 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to be that happy.

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:03.072 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel like you're
a little behind what you want.

00:09:03.072 --> 00:09:04.612 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
life path-- I'm just

00:09:04.612 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
going to write this
down so I remember--

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.522 align:middle line:90%
life path equals purpose.

00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, life purpose.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.813 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and then
the next thing we want?

00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I would say there's
natural match categories.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you said, well, does
nine get along with nine?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.830 align:middle line:84%
When you are hanging with
your natural match category,

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:90%
you tend to like each other.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:90%
By the way, I'm a three.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:90%
He's a nine.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.041 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Gotcha.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.961 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: So here we go.

00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Three, six, nine-- you can write
that down as a pack of numbers.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's creative.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
You could say they're
creative minded.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.645 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And then two,
four, eight-- business minded.

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Business, OK.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.144 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And
when you're a two,

00:09:41.144 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:90%
it's business with your heart.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a two, it's
like, I want to make money,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.368 align:middle line:84%
but I want to make
sure my heart's in it,

00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:90%
not just to make money.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But fours and eights,
they need that security.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
One, five, seven-- that's
the next and final group.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Those are the mind numbers.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:90%
They never stop thinking.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:90%
It's the most cerebral numbers.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They've got to find
healthy ways to escape

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.114 align:middle line:84%
because the dark
side of one, five,

00:10:06.114 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
seven-- escaping
through the alcohol

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.902 align:middle line:84%
because they want to drown their
thoughts, but it doesn't work.

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
No matter how much they drink,
they're still kind of sober.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.205 align:middle line:90%
It's one, five, seven.

00:10:15.205 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there
are only nine numbers.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.663 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well,
these are the basics.

00:10:18.663 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
You also have master numbers,
which people know about.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
You could just put
that, master numbers.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What
is a master number?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: 11--

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hold on.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.993 align:middle line:90%
I'm only going to write so much.

00:10:25.993 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Master numbers.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.295 align:middle line:90%
OK, 11.

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: 11 is one of them.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But don't
you go down to one?

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.838 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well,
in this case, I'll

00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:35.571 align:middle line:84%
explain, but let me
give you-- 11 and 22.

00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that
are the most well known.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.234 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
be born the 11th.

00:10:39.234 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
You could be born the 22nd.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But another master number,
which is unique to get, is 33.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:90%
So you can write that.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But the only way you could get
that is your full date of birth

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.034 align:middle line:90%
before it becomes a six.

00:10:51.034 --> 00:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to tell
you what it means.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if you
have a master number that's

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.150 align:middle line:84%
obvious in your chart, like
born the 11th, born the 22nd.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:90%
You are very sensitive.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:90%
And you can be oversensitive.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.860 align:middle line:90%
And you take things to heart.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And it feels like a cut to your
stomach when someone hurts you.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So I say embrace your lower
frequency vibration as well.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say
11, embrace the two.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:90%
22, embrace your four.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:90%
33, embrace your six.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when you do that, you
feel better about your life.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you always feel
like you're coming up short.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.188 align:middle line:90%
You've got that in you.

00:11:20.188 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
When I said James
has double one,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
it means what's
next, what's next?

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wait a second.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.466 align:middle line:84%
Stop and acknowledge
what you've accomplished.

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:90%
You've done something good.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:90%
And then move on.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.447 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of their lesson.

00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:90%
So life path, purpose.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, this show is
about finding love.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Love by the numbers.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So would they have to do the
other person's life path?

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that's very important,
or how do we do that?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.064 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:11:41.064 --> 00:11:43.119 align:middle line:84%
When you are looking at
a relationship-- though,

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
now, this becomes a
little more complicated

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because you've done
it with six numbers.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can I erase?

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, please.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
You've got three numbers
in a name, three numbers

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.532 align:middle line:84%
in a birthday, and
those six numbers

00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
give you a numerology
blueprint of who you are.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, you're able
to compare your--

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wait, wait.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:90%
You're going way too fast.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, you're
not going to teach this.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.313 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Three
numbers in a name.

00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just
so we understand it.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.789 align:middle line:90%
And three numbers--

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: In a birthday.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.996 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In a birthday.

00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And those
six numbers give you

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
a numerology blueprint
of who you are.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, blueprint.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
Just so we can understand this.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Now all those people
at home can get this.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Because I am very confused.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.473 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's say we're
looking for love.

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a person that's
looking for love,

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and they look for love
in all the wrong places.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.149 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And let's
say they're a two.

00:12:27.149 --> 00:12:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's say their
life path is a two.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Right.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How are
we going to say to them,

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
love is out there, and
this is the type of person

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:90%
you want to find?

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, it
really is mathematical.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.489 align:middle line:90%
This is where numbers come in.

00:12:35.489 --> 00:12:36.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not a game.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.484 align:middle line:84%
Look, I picked my
husband by the numbers.

00:12:38.484 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The book "Love by
the Numbers" was

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.875 align:middle line:84%
written because
I went out there.

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a dating site,
but I said numerologist

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
looking for a man who's
really got my number.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And my husband Charlie--
you know Charlie.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I've been with him 12 years.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:90%
He is my best friend.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But I knew it on paper
before I met him.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.559 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's
just a two life path

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and they hook up with
someone who's a five,

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm instantly concerned
because a five wants freedom,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:90%
and a two needs to feel loved.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Fives tend to
travel, and a two's

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:90%
like, but where are you going?

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:90%
See how that doesn't work?

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so let
me ask you this question.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.489 align:middle line:84%
If you're meeting somebody for
the first time-- it's a date.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
You're just getting
to know them.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.566 align:middle line:84%
You've been on JDate
or Christian Mingle.

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're just there, and
you're meeting a person.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you can do,
besides asking them their birth

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.454 align:middle line:84%
date, maybe their
name or something,

00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
you can get an idea right
away what number they are?

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.495 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Well, yes.

00:13:24.495 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And one fun thing
we did last time

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.017 align:middle line:84%
we can prove with
this room as well

00:13:28.017 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
that if you have
someone's first name,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
you have instant insight
because of the first vowel

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
in their name.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
The other thing you could know,
if you learn the basic life

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
path number, you can
find out automatically--

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
like in the book it
says what turns them on,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:90%
what turns them off.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And you really will know that
without knowing that person.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to do
the first vowel, just

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:90%
to show a couple examples.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.463 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sure.

00:13:48.463 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we do that?

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: We can do that.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And we'll
take the board away.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that all right?

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.765 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:13:51.765 --> 00:13:57.439 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.439 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So here we
are with Glynis McCants,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.041 align:middle line:84%
and today, she's teaching us
all about love and the numbers.

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And everything in the universe
is measured by numbers.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.985 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has a life purpose
number, life path number.

00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And Glynis is going to do a few
reads of the audience regarding

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:90%
their numbers.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:90%
So Glynis?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: OK, because this
group has done their birth

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:84%
dates, I'm going to do what
I call "fast food" reads.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to whip
through a couple just

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.272 align:middle line:84%
to show that, when
you have their number,

00:14:19.272 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
they're no longer a stranger.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.688 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you have
ketchup with that? [GROANS]

00:14:22.688 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK, so let's see.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, who do I want.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.150 align:middle line:84%
If you desperately want
a read, raise your hand.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, my goodness.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.487 align:middle line:90%
She did it first, so go.

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Date of birth?

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.177 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 5/25/1951.

00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you stand, please?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.477 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So your date
of birth 5/25/1951?

00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: All right.

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:90%
Your life path number was?

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.030 align:middle line:90%
What were you?

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: One.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: A one, exactly.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Now here's why that's funny.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Ones always get up first.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Remember how she was the first?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Look, I say ones make good
singers. (SINGING) Me,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:52.770 align:middle line:90%
me, me, me.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Me, me, me, me.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm
a voice teacher.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.486 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:56.486 --> 00:14:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, wow.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.714 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I spent
my 30 years in opera.

00:14:59.714 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You're
on fire, sister.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.440 align:middle line:90%
So here's what else I would say.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Your attitude number is
three, which is humor,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
like you like to laugh, but
you're also communication.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.474 align:middle line:84%
But because you're born
on a seven day, mystery.

00:15:11.474 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you
shut down, they

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:90%
can't get you on the phone.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:15.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like I need a time out.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I need to be by myself now.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And nature speaks to your soul.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, mountains,
plants, flowers--

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
that's when you feel good.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I just
want to regroup,

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.342 align:middle line:90%
and you regroup by yourself.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're a very good
teacher because you

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.825 align:middle line:90%
don't miss any detail.

00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:29.325 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:15:29.325 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So
that's "fast food."

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I want to do another one
just like that over here.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Yeah, that's great.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Can you stand?

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: All right, and
what's your first name?

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Catherine.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: It's Catherine.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.488 align:middle line:84%
And Catherine, what's
your date of birth?

00:15:38.488 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 9/14/61.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.127 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK, 9/14/61.

00:15:42.127 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And what was your life
path because you just

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:90%
learned how to do it?

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Four.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.083 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So you're
a four life path.

00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:48.441 align:middle line:90%
Now this is interesting.

00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Because she was born on a five
day, she has a five attitude.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.560 align:middle line:84%
That means people
don't know you.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
People think they know
you, but they don't really.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.422 align:middle line:84%
How often do you feel
a little misunderstood?

00:15:57.422 --> 00:15:59.389 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that's-- I agree.

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: English works for
me, or any language, but--

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.884 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:03.592 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:03.592 --> 00:16:05.419 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:05.419 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Anyway--

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.543 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm telling y'all.

00:16:07.543 --> 00:16:09.056 align:middle line:90%
I warned you.

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But let me
tell you why I know that.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, what's funny
about this little person,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I was at the hotel.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.040 align:middle line:84%
She was like, oh my
gosh, I know your work.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:90%
I said, please come down.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.445 align:middle line:90%
So here she is.

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:18.965 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
you're the lady.

00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And then, you
picked her, which is gorgeous.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.569 align:middle line:84%
But five means
celebrator of life,

00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
natural detective,
digging for truth.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:90%
You love that.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But behind it is your four, and
your four's afraid of failing.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.707 align:middle line:84%
If I can't do it perfectly,
I don't want to do it.

00:16:31.707 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So good ideas can live
and die in your head.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:90%
How often does that happen?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, that's true.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All the time?

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: And it's frustrating.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So what I would say is
you got to learn to say,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
you know what, put on
my Nikes and just do it.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Stop over-thinking
because life's too short.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not a dress rehearsal.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It's now.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:90%
But your five also tells me--

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just
got the Nikes thing.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.162 align:middle line:90%
Just do it, got it.

00:16:50.162 --> 00:16:51.458 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:51.458 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: With
those fives, it also

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:84%
means, even if you wanted life
to be calm and cool, it's not.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:90%
It's always a drama.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:90%
You're always up against it.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I agree.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Can I just interrupt
for a second?

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:01.150 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just look
around your auric field,

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like drama,
drama, drama all around you.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
something going on.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.821 align:middle line:84%
Even though you'll say to
me, I don't make that happen.

00:17:08.821 --> 00:17:10.379 align:middle line:84%
But there's drama
all around you.

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like, I know that I'm

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
living life if there's
drama going on.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Something has to be happening.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
There's always got
to be stimulation

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:90%
around you for some reason.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Never a dull moment.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.442 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Never a dull moment.

00:17:19.442 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.114 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But she is
a human Christmas tree,

00:17:22.114 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:90%
if you look at that little face.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:90%
She gets very excited.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Look at her.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at the smile.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're a healer.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Right,
and very giving.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.242 align:middle line:84%
It's easier for you
to give than receive.

00:17:31.242 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Not as comfortable receiving.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing, all
fours-- raise your hand

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:90%
if you're a four, besides her.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Keep your hand up
if this rings true.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
The deal breaker
for you is a liar.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.610 align:middle line:84%
If someone's dishonest, you
don't want them in your life

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.805 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:17:43.805 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, all fours.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Stay up.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Because you are about truth.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:90%
And you walk in truth.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So you're like, just tell me
the truth, even if it's bad.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Just tell me.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.405 align:middle line:84%
But if you find out behind your
back, you don't get over it.

00:17:55.405 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So you got to let those people
go instead of torture them

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and say, remember when
you-- don't do that.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
It's better to let
them go if you can.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the four.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.533 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:04.533 --> 00:18:04.947 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who doesn't
have love in their life?

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
They're really searching
for a mate, a partner?

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.137 align:middle line:84%
Is anybody here looking
for some person?

00:18:11.137 --> 00:18:12.011 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Be honest.

00:18:12.011 --> 00:18:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Hands up high.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.650 align:middle line:90%
That messes you up.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say,
"Love by the Numbers"

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.242 align:middle line:84%
was set up not
just for love love,

00:18:19.242 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I got to
have my partner.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about learning
to get along better

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.736 align:middle line:84%
with the people in your
life so that you feel better

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:25.521 align:middle line:90%
about love.

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And even-- I talk
about naming your pet--

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.362 align:middle line:84%
you can have a pet that you
love, but it's a psycho.

00:18:30.362 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's the name.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:90%
The name.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going
to share with them.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.804 align:middle line:84%
It's all very much
numbers because last night

00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in the hotel--

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, so good.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.506 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I asked
Glynis about this.

00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
My room was 257 or
something, and she said,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:90%
that's not good for you.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: No.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She said, the
night before, did you sleep?

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I couldn't get
to sleep the night before.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
I could not get to sleep.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm tossing and turning.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: That's right.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.083 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
said, what's that about?

00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
And you said--

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I said,
that room is a five.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.268 align:middle line:90%
There's no way you can sleep.

00:18:53.268 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
That's a room
where people party.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:90%
A drug addict would be happy.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I will say apartment
complexes often have the five.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So I told him-- I gave
him numbers to alter it.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Because in my book, I say
how do you alter the energy?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I said put a six on
the inside of the door

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to make it into
the energy of two.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
I said put a two between your
mattress because he's a healer,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and two's the healing
number, so you can sleep.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And you?

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.663 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I did.

00:19:16.663 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I slept great.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I put a six next to
the door on the inside

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and I put a two next to me
in the bed and slept great.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And
slept like a baby.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.539 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that neat?

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Who has
a love relationship

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and wants to know if you're
soul mates with your partner?

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:26.974 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, yes.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: How about that?

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If you're soul
mates with your partner.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.336 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Right here.

00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:33.176 align:middle line:90%
This gal's interested.

00:19:33.176 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
To keep it simple, let's just
do your full date of birth.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.940 align:middle line:90%
What is yours?

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.079 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 7/14/1964.

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: OK, and
then your partner?

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:46.376 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 11/27/1965.

00:19:46.376 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK, so this fun.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, what I'm
doing, I'm doing--

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
the three numbers
in your birth date

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
is sacred because
you can't change it.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:90%
You can always change your name.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.531 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:57.571 align:middle line:84%
So if your name's not
terrific with your partner,

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:59.070 align:middle line:84%
you can alter it
to make it better.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to go with
just why they're good together

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:90%
and what makes it fun for you.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.015 align:middle line:90%
How many years now?

00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 27.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, thank you.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: No, but
here's what's funny.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.439 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:20:08.439 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Be honest.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Haven't there been
times you're like,

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:90%
wow, do I want to do this?

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:90%
This seems a bit much.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: They never leave.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:14.436 align:middle line:90%
I swear.

00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:15.225 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:15.225 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I refer to it as--
got your five.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.075 align:middle line:84%
You're double five
like my friend.

00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And she'll say, you know,
I think I'm leaving.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:90%
I said, how many years?

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:90%
47.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, would you just stop?

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.610 align:middle line:90%
You're not leaving.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
But a five needs to know they
can leave if they want to.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Now what's fun is he's
also a five, just like you.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.817 align:middle line:84%
So it means you guys are
going 150 miles a minute.

00:20:32.817 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And someone needs
to check the brakes,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.344 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise you
can hit that wall.

00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you've done.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.884 align:middle line:84%
You've hit the
wall many and then

00:20:38.884 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:90%
just made it through again.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.809 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I see--
you're a natural counselor.

00:20:42.809 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:90%
So what's his first name?

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sean.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Sean is your patient.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:46.566 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, wow.

00:20:46.566 --> 00:20:47.399 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: You know?

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:49.654 align:middle line:84%
You've ended up counseling
Sean, working through Sean,

00:20:49.654 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
helping Sean with his stuff.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And Sean, chances are,
has issues from his family

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
originally as a
kid-- mom and dad.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.172 align:middle line:84%
What do you know about
that original family?

00:20:59.172 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: What do you mean?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.796 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
he have issues?

00:21:01.796 --> 00:21:03.593 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: What were they like?

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I don't
want to say in case--

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, you do.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:90%
They were horrible.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.735 align:middle line:90%
But thank you.

00:21:06.735 --> 00:21:08.012 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.012 --> 00:21:08.783 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.783 --> 00:21:10.116 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't mince words.

00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:11.776 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: What I'm
saying is-- first of all,

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.200 align:middle line:84%
no one-- they're
not watching Gaiam.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:90%
And I say that with love.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
The chances of them
coming across-- no.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying to
you is, with the nine,

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
they have old
issues from family.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And they don't let it go.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You're born on
a five day, five life path.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.868 align:middle line:90%
What you see is what you get.

00:21:27.868 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:90%
He gets moody.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.900 align:middle line:84%
He's almost-- duality
in his personality.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.514 align:middle line:84%
He sometimes feels
schizo, right?

00:21:33.514 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: It's like
who are you now?

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.035 align:middle line:90%
Whiplash in agreement?

00:21:37.035 --> 00:21:37.701 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:37.701 --> 00:21:38.654 align:middle line:90%

00:21:38.654 --> 00:21:39.125 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.125 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But
that's what it is.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But I'ms saying I see why
you've gone the distance,

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to stop
rescuing as much as you do.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, let's
let him figure out.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And focus on other
things because when

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.270 align:middle line:84%
it comes to our partner, if
we study them too closely,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.979 align:middle line:84%
no one looks good
under the microscope.

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: True.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: No.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:90%
And you do that.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.421 align:middle line:84%
You dissect him,
and it ain't pretty.

00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So we're
going to give her your book.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to give
you "Love by the Numbers."

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yay,
you get the book.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:03.594 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:03.594 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Look at you, and
you're going to like the read.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to like what
you see about you guys.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: All
right, thank you.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, sweetheart.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Before we go, I want
to readings here

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
because I know there
are dead people wanting

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:90%
to speak to people here.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
they come from love.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And they are love.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And your love brings
them in as well.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's all tools to
find that love of self and love

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:90%
in each other.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Since you're here,
I've got to ask you

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:90%
about certain celebrities.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.194 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Oh, yes.

00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
we all like celebrities.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So some celebrities,
like Beyonce and Jay-Z.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Do we all know who
Beyonce and Jay-Z is?

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: OK, you hear
about them, and I know--

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
they're married.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: They are married.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But
I'm sure there was--

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: -- which I love.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to tell you,
they have a fascinating story.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:90%
We burn out.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.517 align:middle line:84%
Like if you love other things--
I'm sure this room's burnt out

00:22:46.517 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:84%
on the celebrity stuff because
every time you go online,

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:90%
it's in your face.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's not really their fault.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.101 align:middle line:84%
It's keeping you
distracted by other issues.

00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.391 align:middle line:84%
We know politically,
don't look over there.

00:22:56.391 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:90%
Look at Beyonce and Jay-Z.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.533 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: However, comma,
they are fascinating.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Here's why.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Both were born on a four day,
and both are a five life path.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Four is commitment.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Five wants freedom.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.345 align:middle line:84%
They dated six years
before they got married.

00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Interesting.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.691 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And then they
tattooed the number four

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:84%
on their ring finger, and
four's the commitment number.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So they're like, we're
going to go for it.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to try
to make it work.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
This couple has
manifested $800 million.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, that means meant to be.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So yes, the tabloids like to
rip things to shreds, right?

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they're breaking up.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.208 align:middle line:84%
Oh, look, he's--
I'm like, I can't.

00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer Aniston's had how many
babies in the last seven years?

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.379 align:middle line:90%
And she's had none.

00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
people they go after.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:90%
So I would tell you--

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How about
Catherine Zeta-Jones

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and Michael Douglas.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.218 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: That's
another good one.

00:23:42.218 --> 00:23:45.614 align:middle line:84%
Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael
Douglas were born the same day.

00:23:45.614 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
born the same day,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.202 align:middle line:90%
it's an instant connection.

00:23:48.202 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And the minute he
met her, he says,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.495 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have your
babies-- first thing he said.

00:23:51.495 --> 00:23:52.703 align:middle line:90%
She's like, get away from me.

00:23:52.703 --> 00:23:53.671 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.671 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:90%
But here they are.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So when they went
through that break up

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit,
the separation,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.252 align:middle line:90%
I knew it wasn't going to end.

00:24:00.252 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Because here's what
goes wrong-- and this

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.376 align:middle line:84%
is true for everyone
in the room--

00:24:03.376 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
if there's drugs or
alcohol involved,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how good it looks
on paper, it's not healthy.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.910 align:middle line:90%
And remember she was drinking.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:90%
She had the bipolar.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:90%
He went through throat cancer.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They went through way
too much, and it was just

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:90%
done for a moment.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm like, they
will come full circle.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.762 align:middle line:84%
And he said, now, it's
mandatory date night.

00:24:19.762 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I don't want
to lose this woman.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.969 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the sparkle again.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
That's numbers.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really good
at not just saying,

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.961 align:middle line:84%
oh, they belong together or
they shouldn't be together,

00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
but I can see where
it could come back,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the potential of
what it could be.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you think
they will be back together?

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: They are.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.638 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They are.

00:24:35.638 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Didn't even know that.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: James is on
the Starship Enterprise.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.685 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.385 align:middle line:90%
I like it here.

00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: He's not going to
know what's on planet Earth.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
He's like, but
where are they now?

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But I brought this
to beam me up.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.778 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, very nice.

00:24:50.778 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: I did that for you.

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you, Glynis.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Give Glynis a--

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.133 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, thank you.

00:24:54.133 --> 00:24:54.945 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:54.945 --> 00:25:00.207 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Glynis' book,
"Love by the Numbers,"

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:03.520 align:middle line:84%
definitely everybody
should go get that.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And "Glynis Has
Your Number," also.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.053 align:middle line:90%
And she's on the internet.

00:25:06.053 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Very, very well-known and
very, very good at what

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:90%
she does, obviously.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.511 align:middle line:84%
And if this goes
bad, side, south, she

00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:90%
can always go do comedy.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.482 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.482 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
We might do a Las Vegas
act together, actually.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:16.760 align:middle line:90%
We're thinking about it.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Might?

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:90%
We're doing it right now--

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Psychic
and a sidekick.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: --in Boulder.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.851 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And friends, yes.

00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:22.088 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.088 --> 00:25:22.677 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.677 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to, a little
bit, if we could, just

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
work with the
spirit world who've

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:84%
been enjoying this
and helpful also.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that
came here, I hope

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.790 align:middle line:84%
you got a lot out of this today
because I know that they did.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And you got to change things
up every once in awhile

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.145 align:middle line:84%
and look at yourself in a
different way and perhaps

00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
with different tools
to understand yourself.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.808 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady who
comes very close to me.

00:25:39.808 --> 00:25:45.194 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like this lady was
laid out when she passed away.

00:25:45.194 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a family member.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.672 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
the-- I'm not sure

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:84%
if it's the daughter in
the audience right here.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But definitely would
have the dress--

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
a certain dress.

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.603 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to make sure
her mother looked very, very

00:25:54.603 --> 00:25:56.775 align:middle line:84%
good when she put her in
the wake or laying her out.

00:25:56.775 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:90%
I've got to say that.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it
was a yellowish dress,

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.835 align:middle line:90%
but that's what I see here.

00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
had to be nails applied

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:84%
on my fingernails, fake
nails on my fingernails.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it makes your
mom's hands look good.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Who does that make
sense to anybody here?

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:90%
No one understands that.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Seriously?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.227 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:26:18.227 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So I might be wrong saying
it's a mother or grandmother.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It might be somebody else,
like a mother-in-law.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.031 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Mother-in-law, correct?

00:26:24.031 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, would you mind standing?

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:84%
So you understand
about the lady who

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
would have been laid out very
nicely when she passed away.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That'd
be a mother-in-law.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm also feeling there could be
sparkles around the necklace,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:84%
like wearing a nice necklace
or having sparkles around me.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, she
always had beautiful jewelry

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and very well dressed.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.249 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:41.747 align:middle line:84%
I just get the feeling
when she comes to me.

00:26:41.747 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a feeling
of being very cropped.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.734 align:middle line:84%
She had to be beautifully
put out, turned out.

00:26:46.734 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that you

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.360 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure everything
was perfect for her.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I got
to tell you that she

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.519 align:middle line:84%
wants to thank you
for doing that.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I know there's an
older woman around.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.142 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you
have a sister-in-law?

00:26:57.142 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:90%
You understand sister-in-law?

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.774 align:middle line:90%
So your husband's sister?

00:26:59.774 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now I know that
there'd be a gold wristwatch

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:84%
because she shows me
a gold wrist watch.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's Longinnes,
L-O-N-G-I-N-N-E-S.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Longinnes wristwatch.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a gold metal wristwatch.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, her daughter
has a beautiful watch like I've

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
never seen before,
a gold one she

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:84%
was wearing the other
day that was hers.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
that's mother's.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.413 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:27:20.413 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's L-O-N-G-I-N-N-E-S. And
I see it very, very clearly.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's a jewelry line.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Was that the watch line?

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So would you find out
about that because she's

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.260 align:middle line:90%
talking about that.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I like that a lot.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's talking
to me about her nails now.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.515 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make sure her
nails look very, very pretty.

00:27:35.515 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know you
made that-- got it--

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
you made that statement
about her nails and her hands

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.894 align:middle line:90%
have to be a certain way.

00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And do you know if
she had a brooch on?

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.528 align:middle line:84%
She was wearing a brooch or
they put something on her

00:27:46.528 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:90%
like a brooch on the body.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I believe so.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she
shows me a brooch here

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.078 align:middle line:90%
when she's lying there.

00:27:51.078 --> 00:27:54.037 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh my goodness, I
lost a lot of weight, she said.

00:27:54.037 --> 00:27:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She did.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As she
looked at the body,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:84%
she goes, oh my goodness,
I lost a lot of weight.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.570 align:middle line:84%
She's very funny
because this is just--

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She is.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love her
energy, her sense of humor.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
She's looking down at that
casket, being laid out.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.625 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, I
wouldn't wish this on anybody.

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my god.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she said, I
wouldn't wish that on anybody.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:90%
They put perfume on me.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.981 align:middle line:90%
They stunk it up with perfume.

00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:90%
And she has beautiful perfume.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.188 align:middle line:84%
This lady had perfume
from the south of France.

00:28:15.188 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:90%
She had perfume from everywhere.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I bought perfume in New
York City, she said.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
it was on Park Avenue.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
She loved Park Avenue.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:90%
She just loves it.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:90%
And who is Michael?

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.619 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's her oldest son.

00:28:26.619 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
he involve himself

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.202 align:middle line:84%
with her goods, what she
left behind in the world?

00:28:33.202 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He's the
executor, I believe.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And I know that something
was changed as far as where

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.835 align:middle line:84%
the-- either where was laid
to rest, where she was going

00:28:41.835 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to be laid to rest
that changed up.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:44.130 align:middle line:90%
They made a change in that.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I know that there

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.430 align:middle line:84%
was a change from what it
originally was going to be.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, thank you.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
She's talking about that.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.988 align:middle line:84%
I know that she used
to wear a fox stole.

00:28:51.988 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS]

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.615 align:middle line:90%
She said a fox stole.

00:28:53.615 --> 00:28:54.866 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember the fox stole?

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:56.823 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Her store is
called The Silver Fox.

00:28:56.823 --> 00:28:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Everyone called
her the silver fox,

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.024 align:middle line:84%
and she had a beautiful
silver fox fur.

00:29:00.024 --> 00:29:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, that's what
I see, very much right here.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.316 align:middle line:90%
Very much here.

00:29:03.316 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's her story.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.034 align:middle line:90%
That's who she is.

00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:06.450 align:middle line:84%
That does describe
her beautifully

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.825 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
regal part of her.

00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:10.325 align:middle line:84%
I like the little hair thing
on here, this little hair thing

00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:84%
here, the net thing or hair
thing I'm seeing with her.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She always
had her hair done.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.838 align:middle line:90%

Everything is impeccable.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.002 align:middle line:84%
She'd go to finishing
school, this lady.

00:29:18.002 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:90%
She really could.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Finishing school all the way.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I like the way she handwrites.

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.520 align:middle line:90%
She has stuff in handwriting.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.611 align:middle line:90%
She wrote you a card.

00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:84%
She said, you have a card of
mine with my handwriting on it.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I do.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.050 align:middle line:84%

>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:29.080 align:middle line:90%
She'd always write cards.

>>VAN PRAAGH: She
always liked cards.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.795 align:middle line:90%
She never forgot a birthday.

00:29:30.795 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She never
forgot a birthday.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:90%
She never forgot an anniversary.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:90%
She was right there.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.656 align:middle line:84%
She'd be the first
card to get it.

00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.461 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She spent
a lot of time and effort.

00:29:38.461 --> 00:29:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything she did,
time and effort.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:90%
She cared.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.598 align:middle line:84%
She had a mindfulness
about every little action

00:29:42.598 --> 00:29:43.240 align:middle line:90%
that she made.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
that many of her things--

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.840 align:middle line:84%
she wants to thank you
for respecting her things.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

She has the best shoes.

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know that.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I want to-- if you could--
I think things are still

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:84%
a little bit in a
flux in the family

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.385 align:middle line:84%
with her passing
and her materials.

00:29:57.385 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.893 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she
says things are in flux.

00:30:00.893 --> 00:30:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I want you to
please, please, she said, would

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.590 align:middle line:84%
you take care of my things and
give them to people who really

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.950 align:middle line:84%
appreciate them, not
just throw them out.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you'll
smell her perfume,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:90%
and that's her sign to you.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:90%
She loves you very much.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for helping.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:14.296 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

00:30:14.296 --> 00:30:15.228 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:15.228 --> 00:30:16.626 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:16.626 --> 00:30:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
you lost your dad, yes?

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
mind standing up, please?

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, not at all.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
what is your name?

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's Clifton.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
going to tell you

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that when I bring
this man close to me,

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
he wants me to tell you that
he's happy that you're here.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you that he got you here.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you were
not going to come here,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:90%
but he got you here.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know you
weren't-- there was a time--

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and I know this-- you
were going to leave,

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.157 align:middle line:90%
but you had to come back.

00:30:38.157 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
that drove you

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in your mind that said,
I got to come back.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe my dad's going
to come through.

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I got to tell you

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.003 align:middle line:84%
that Dad is coming through
now, and Dad's coming through

00:30:47.003 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.851 align:middle line:84%
Also, I've got to talk
about someone drinking.

00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:51.476 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why,
but I want to talk

00:30:51.476 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
about someone
drinking in the family

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.680 align:middle line:90%
that he would know, your dad.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Is there a drinker
in your family

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.335 align:middle line:90%
that your father would know of?

00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You know,
alcoholism really

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.570 align:middle line:90%
isn't an issue in our family.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are
you guys married?

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No,
this is my sister.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
that's your sister.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:90%
This is your dad, too.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.574 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, stand up.

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:08.276 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:08.276 --> 00:31:09.191 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.929 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here we go.

00:31:10.929 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:90%
We're getting the whole thing.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.205 align:middle line:84%
OK, so do you know of
someone who'd be an alcoholic

00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:84%
or who died an
alcoholic in the family?

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Our grandparents
were alcoholics.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His
parents, specifically.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, his parents.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
There are two more siblings
you have, stepsiblings?

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Two more.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right?

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
he would know of?

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He would
know of them, yeah.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to give
you some information.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:84%
He's very much involved
in everybody's lives.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say that to you.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's still
living on the earth here?

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.813 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, great.

00:31:34.813 --> 00:31:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about something
he's involved himself in,

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.804 align:middle line:90%
and he can't breathe.

00:31:38.804 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Before he passes over,
he can't breathe.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
he was given oxygen

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:84%
at one point toward
the end of his life

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.440 align:middle line:84%
or he had to have
help with breathing.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Would you know about that?

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.805 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was in a canyon.

00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
was in a canyon.

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.207 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In Utah.

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did they go find
him or paramedics go after him?

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
were looking for him.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.895 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if they put an
oxygen mask on him, because he

00:31:55.895 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:90%
said they did.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm sure they did.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It'd be likely.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.193 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
he get in the newspapers?

00:32:00.193 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Was his death in the newspapers?

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.266 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:02.266 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did he go hiking?

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Backpacking.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Backpacking, great.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:06.994 align:middle line:90%
And did he go by myself?

00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, do you know if
there were two other people who

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
were going to go with
him, but they decided

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.822 align:middle line:84%
not to at the last--
and/or changed their minds?

00:32:14.822 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That
could've happened.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:16.675 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's likely.

00:32:16.675 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You'll
have to find out.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's typical.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
don't know who Bill is.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.500 align:middle line:84%
He's mentioning the
name Bill to me.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Someone named Bill or
William, Bill, Billy.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Bill is--

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: One of
his best friends.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Bill Wilson is
one of his best friends.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Bill, hello.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Check with Bill, hello.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.006 align:middle line:90%
One of his best friends.

00:32:29.006 --> 00:32:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So he was going to go
with him, whether there

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
was talk about it, or
he mentioned it to Bill.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.009 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that the family or
someone's looking at the map

00:32:35.009 --> 00:32:36.425 align:middle line:84%
and looking at all
different maps.

00:32:36.425 --> 00:32:37.236 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:32:37.236 --> 00:32:38.485 align:middle line:90%
And looking at the trail maps.

00:32:38.485 --> 00:32:39.580 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know they're drawing

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the trails, which way
would he have gone,

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:42.960 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I know it's red marker
that I'm seeing.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the red marker
that I'm seeing the trails.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.288 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:48.288 --> 00:32:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Now if I was to go
right down to your car

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and if I was to go in
the glove compartment,

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.819 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't I find
some kind of a map?

00:32:54.819 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Any of my
vehicles have maps in them.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In many
of your vehicles.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.059 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:32:58.059 --> 00:32:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that your
dad is talking to me

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
about if I went into
your glove compartment,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:90%
there'd be a map there.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I know that you think of your
dad in the car all the time.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's
something about him

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.366 align:middle line:84%
in their car that you
have to remind you of him

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My backpack.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
your backpack.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's his car.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, it's his car.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:17.980 align:middle line:90%
It's your dad's car?

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.438 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
one of his cars.

00:33:19.438 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I
don't know about that.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's get more specific here
because I don't like that.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I want him to tell me more.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.385 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
carry his backpack.

00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:29.465 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want
him to tell me more.

00:33:29.465 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you like the lake?

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Did you like the lake?

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Did he like to go to the
lake sometime, your father?

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.016 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever go near a lake?

00:33:34.016 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about a lake

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:36.620 align:middle line:84%
when you were younger,
going to a lake?

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He lived
next to a lake.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
lived next to a lake.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.305 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have a knife
that belonged to your Dad?

00:33:42.305 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lots of them.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like a little
red knife or something

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:90%
that-- a pocket knife.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's
telling me you have that.

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Why am I going
to go to the water with you?

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want
to go to the water.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
want to go scuba diving.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
want to go snorkeling.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.063 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've thought
about doing that, or just

00:33:57.063 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
getting certified in that.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:58.575 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.575 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Have you thought
about going to Mexico?

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm going to Mexico.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's probably her.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
going to Mexico.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:90%
He said Mexico to me.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.610 align:middle line:90%
So you're going to Mexico.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.856 align:middle line:84%
And it was this talk
about snorkeling or maybe

00:34:07.856 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:84%
going to do something like that
down there because you will.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, there might be something
about certifying, being

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:84%
certified as a scuba diver,
or something like that.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:14.850 align:middle line:90%
He's all about this.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
He's going to be with you
on that-- I understand that.

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.093 align:middle line:84%
He said he's giving you
that trip to Mexico.

00:34:19.093 --> 00:34:20.354 align:middle line:90%
It's from him.

00:34:20.354 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How
the weird thing

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.544 align:middle line:90%
happened, how it all worked out.

00:34:23.544 --> 00:34:25.793 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of weird, the dates
that it's going as well.

00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.260 align:middle line:90%
It's coming up.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm leaving Friday.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
leaving Friday.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.338 align:middle line:90%
Have a good time.

00:34:31.338 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Remember us in the cold.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.742 align:middle line:90%
OK, one more thing.

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:38.325 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband
and my daughter

00:34:38.325 --> 00:34:40.050 align:middle line:90%
are certified scuba divers.

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.469 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, are they?

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:42.319 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:34:42.319 --> 00:34:44.735 align:middle line:84%
But I also got to tell you he
said, going to be certified,

00:34:44.735 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
so there's something
coming up for you.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:47.522 align:middle line:90%
So don't even ask them.

00:34:47.522 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But when you get down there,
I'd say, come on, honey,

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:90%
maybe you want to be certified.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:90%
See if that happens.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.261 align:middle line:90%
Guarantee it will.

00:34:52.261 --> 00:34:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Guarantee it will.

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.381 align:middle line:84%
I want to say something
to the son, my son.

00:34:55.381 --> 00:34:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I want to say something you'll
understand about your father.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.220 align:middle line:90%
And I know you have his hat.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.630 align:middle line:90%
I know you have my hat.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
I know you have
pride with that hat.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's a cap
or a hat of his, correct?

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, or no?

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, thank you.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Just do your part,
that's all I ask.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.288 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:35:11.288 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know I'm
talking here about campgrounds,

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.735 align:middle line:90%
camping, camping out.

00:35:16.735 --> 00:35:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I know if I'd come
to you, I have

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:84%
memories of camping or going
on camp-- a long time ago.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:21.606 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:21.606 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And you would know
about that, correct?

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know that if I
could take that cap

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and I smell the
smoke of the fire.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I understand that.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:31.525 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:35:31.525 --> 00:35:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.955 align:middle line:84%
And you never thought about
boating, going boating?

00:35:33.955 --> 00:35:36.551 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever like to go boating
sometimes or getting a boat?

00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Only canoes.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.049 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
like you in boating.

00:35:39.049 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I like you in boats.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but I
want to see you in boats.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.854 align:middle line:84%
Did you go into canoes
or boats with your dad

00:35:44.854 --> 00:35:46.120 align:middle line:90%
when he was alive?

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, we used
to canoe quite a bit.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, one more thing
I want to give you--

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and I want to thank
you for being here.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:51.536 align:middle line:84%
Your whole family's
here because of you.

00:35:51.536 --> 00:35:54.347 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say one thing
to you and then move on.

00:35:54.347 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to say it to you
that you'll know it's him.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, my son has the backbone
I've always wanted to have.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.589 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:05.671 align:middle line:84%
That's the phraseology
I have to use,

00:36:05.671 --> 00:36:08.550 align:middle line:84%
my son has the backbone I've
always wanted him to have.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I'll
leave you with that.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.206 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:12.206 --> 00:36:13.610 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.674 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.674 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to
talk about a lady over here.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a mother figure
that comes in here.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.076 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
this lady couldn't

00:36:21.076 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:84%
speak when she was passing
away, or right before she

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.425 align:middle line:90%
lost her vocals, verbal person.

00:36:26.425 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was a
stroke, but she couldn't [GASPS]

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:90%
express herself.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I want
to go back here somewhere

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.984 align:middle line:84%
with a mother who had
a problem with that.

00:36:33.984 --> 00:36:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Was it your mom?

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.792 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:36:35.792 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.020 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Elizabeth.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
mind standing up, Elizabeth?

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.212 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Certainly.

00:36:40.212 --> 00:36:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.455 align:middle line:84%
So this lady is very, very
excited to speak finally.

00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:46.990 align:middle line:90%
She finally got her voice back.

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:49.444 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a mother that
could not speak at the end?

00:36:49.444 --> 00:36:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And you understand that
this lady was, in a way,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel, whether I'm
paralyzed-- I can't move.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She was in a coma.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't tell me.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.617 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, sorry.

00:37:00.617 --> 00:37:01.366 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:37:01.366 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:90%
She could not move.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I
want to know that you're

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the
bed because she saw you

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the bed.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
you're standing

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the bed, and
you're looking right at her.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.959 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that your
father is there as well.

00:37:12.959 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So your father must've
been in spirit then.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
as I'm looking

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.993 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the
bed-- I'm you now

00:37:17.993 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of this bed--
my father's over here.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.173 align:middle line:90%
Her husband's right there.

00:37:21.173 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:90%
She's right there.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's in and
out of the body quite a bit.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
the month of April or May

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:90%
is very significant here.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, that's
my birthday month.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
that's your birthday.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And my sister's
birthday month would be April.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.448 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:36.235 align:middle line:84%
I know after I died, you put
up a-- right-- you cheered me.

00:37:36.235 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:90%
You cheered me.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: (LAUGHING) Yes.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
understand that?

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.250 align:middle line:90%
You cheered me.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know she
wants to thank for that.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Because it's very interesting.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We talked with
Glynis earlier today.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
We talked about some people have
to get things right, perfectly

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:47.300 align:middle line:90%
right when they do things.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And you did everything
right for your mother.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know you
put lotion on her skin.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I know you did that.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And you really made it
soft, and you really

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:84%
tried to make it
better than it was.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know you
didn't like my mouth open,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:58.700 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you actually
made a comment to the nurse,

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.600 align:middle line:84%
please don't have her
mouth open like that.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.902 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well-- yes.

00:38:04.902 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.235 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
she said you wanted

00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:09.682 align:middle line:84%
it to be very--
you know, dignity.

00:38:09.682 --> 00:38:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And she's all about
dignity, your mother.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Would you know about
your father and mom--

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:13.765 align:middle line:90%
your father's coming in now.

00:38:13.765 --> 00:38:15.056 align:middle line:90%
He said everything's all right.

00:38:15.056 --> 00:38:15.612 align:middle line:90%
She's OK.

00:38:15.612 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth is your name?

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Elizabeth.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Isn't there another
Elizabeth over here please?

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.795 align:middle line:84%
Is there a grandmother
with that name or is there

00:38:21.795 --> 00:38:23.060 align:middle line:90%
an aunt with the name Elizabeth?

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's a family name.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
a family name.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, then
other people over here

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:84%
have something to
do with that name.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very aware of that.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware, also,
when you were a younger girl,

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to a
memory of driving

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.090 align:middle line:84%
in a station wagon
with the family.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, oh yeah.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.315 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:38:35.315 --> 00:38:36.815 align:middle line:84%
Because when Dad
comes through, he's

00:38:36.815 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:84%
giving me this memory
of a station wagon.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Now I know that.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.321 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware--
go on, go on, slow down.

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stop.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a two-toned car.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to get what
kind of car it is here.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I know we have the
rack on the top.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.510 align:middle line:84%
On the back of the hood,
there's that rack for luggage.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.593 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to get it.

00:38:55.593 --> 00:38:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It begins with an R. I'm
trying to get the car.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you kids are
fighting in the back.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:00.982 align:middle line:90%
Now be quiet, the three of you.

00:39:00.982 --> 00:39:02.106 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet, the three of you.

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet back there.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:90%
The three of you be quiet.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And who ended up
being a policeman

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.864 align:middle line:90%
or working for the law.

00:39:06.864 --> 00:39:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No one
that I know of.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.532 align:middle line:90%
Oh, uncle, my uncle.

00:39:09.532 --> 00:39:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was
a policeman, was he?

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a sheriff.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.776 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sheriff.

00:39:12.776 --> 00:39:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So I know-- waving
here from that.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But I get that feeling of
police or sheriff here.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And he's also talking
to me about when

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:20.500 align:middle line:90%
the family used to get together.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I know there would have
been-- the family would've

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.780 align:middle line:84%
gotten together, and it would've
been in the summer times.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this
man, the sheriff,

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:84%
know it's his family
would've been there as well.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So I know there would've been
like a family get-together.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.264 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
car is going somewhere.

00:39:32.264 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Where is that
station wagon going?

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And then that guy
comes in, he goes,

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.038 align:middle line:84%
we're having a
family get-together.

00:39:36.038 --> 00:39:38.032 align:middle line:84%
And it was like barbecues
and things like this.

00:39:38.032 --> 00:39:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Many times.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Many times.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
memories that I

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:84%
know that love-- that
this loving energy brings.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.416 align:middle line:90%
Spirit comes back in memories.

00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:46.915 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:39:46.915 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.125 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And they're
talking about that.

00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And-- I'm obsessed
with that car.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.312 align:middle line:90%
Let it go, James.

00:39:54.312 --> 00:39:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel I want
to talk about the floaty

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:90%
that you were in.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:90%
The floaty?

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember
that floaty that you had.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
You said, Mommy, I
want that floaty.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's giving me this--
the whole thing about you

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.220 align:middle line:84%
wanted to buy the floaty at like
five-and-ten, a nickel and dime

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:04.719 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No doubt.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
there'd be old photographs

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.980 align:middle line:90%
of these get-togethers.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that you

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.790 align:middle line:84%
would have been either talking
about them recently or talking

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to a sibling about them or
looking at them recently.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
to you, please?

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.881 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's
lots of pictures.

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And they are on Facebook.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.654 align:middle line:84%
And my sister just--
what do you call

00:40:20.654 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
it-- shared a whole
bunch of them.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.986 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:40:22.986 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Did she share one
when you were kids?

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.016 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:40:26.016 --> 00:40:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And she would've shared one
also if it was either the family

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.752 align:middle line:84%
get-together or the lake
or something like that.

00:40:30.752 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, we had
a cottage at the lake.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Cottage at the lake.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.348 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:34.348 --> 00:40:37.014 align:middle line:84%
And the station wagon would
haul all the stuff to the lake.

00:40:37.014 --> 00:40:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know the
barbecues-- the guys--

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:84%
the men would
barbecue the franks

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and the beans and
the hamburgers.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:41.470 align:middle line:90%
That sort of a thing.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.053 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
would do the cooking.

00:40:43.053 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: One more thing.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.294 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:40:44.294 --> 00:40:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Your dad is showing me
a flag, a military flag.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.705 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:46.705 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
he's in the military

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:48.898 align:middle line:90%
because he's shows me a flag.

00:40:48.898 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:90%
And he's very much that way.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.410 align:middle line:84%
He's very honorable this
man when he comes in here.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.542 align:middle line:84%
And he said, ah, the
hell with the insurance.

00:40:54.542 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:90%
Ah, the hell with the insurance.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:84%
The insurance didn't
pay something,

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.144 align:middle line:84%
or the insurance might not
have paid for your mom or him.

00:41:01.144 --> 00:41:03.187 align:middle line:84%
But he said, the hell
with that insurance.

00:41:03.187 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said to me.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Because he's all about the
insurance, or something being

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:84%
paid by insurance,
and it never did.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It
would be like him.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, that's
what he's talking about.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know I collect the
newspapers for a long time.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Stack up the newspapers.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.640 align:middle line:84%
He used to collect
things like this.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.085 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of a junker
or a collector of things.

00:41:18.085 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.376 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that he would-- 1943--

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.225 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:22.225 --> 00:41:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --is significant.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.447 align:middle line:90%
1943.

00:41:24.447 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what that means.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Can I say?

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, tell me.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a
lieutenant commander

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Navy in
the South Pacific.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.582 align:middle line:90%
And he was at Guadalcanal.

00:41:31.582 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And pretty much--

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:33.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that was 1943.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: There you go.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.743 align:middle line:90%
Because I know that.

00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:38.864 align:middle line:84%
I know that he saved
that newspaper.

00:41:38.864 --> 00:41:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.894 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that when
you went through his things,

00:41:41.894 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:90%
you would've found that out.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We did.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
you've seen those pictures

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:45.850 align:middle line:90%
on the front cover.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And Pearl Harbor was a big deal.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.277 align:middle line:84%
And your dad lost a
lot of friends there.

00:41:49.277 --> 00:41:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was very aware
of that sort of thing.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.370 align:middle line:84%
When you were a
little girl, there's

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle line:84%
a house you lived next to
near a white picket fence.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Would you have any
memory of that?

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.545 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was
my grandmother's.

00:41:56.545 --> 00:41:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That was
your grandma's, great.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And didn't you used to go over
there all the time, visit.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She just
lived a block away.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Around the corner.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she
loved the rose gardens.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:04.840 align:middle line:90%
She loved the rose gardens.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.350 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now
she's coming in,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.070 align:middle line:84%
obviously, because I
don't walk like this.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:08.968 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:08.968 --> 00:42:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:10.630 align:middle line:90%
She's coming in.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.706 align:middle line:84%
And she has-- she shows
me like these things

00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:13.830 align:middle line:90%
that you walk under, arbor.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A rose arbor.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Because she goes,
look at my arbor.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And she stands there, and
the roses are over the arbor.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.260 align:middle line:90%
And she's very proud.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.468 align:middle line:84%
She's very proud at how
pretty she makes things look.

00:42:22.468 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She said
it's done from love.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
it's done from love.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And she makes her own
outfits or own clothes.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.010 align:middle line:84%
She's a very
self-sufficient lady.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
She said, don't you
come here until you--

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.760 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
help with something.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Don't just sit around.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:34.500 align:middle line:90%
You're going to help.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that she
used to make lemonade

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.000 align:middle line:90%
when you used to come over.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:90%
She used to make some lemonade.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.246 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:42:39.246 --> 00:42:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And do you
remember her with a hose.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, she'd
be out in the garden.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With a hose.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But I know I want to
clean that sidewalk, too.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.407 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:45.407 --> 00:42:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I want
you kids help me we weed.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So she gets you on hands
and knees to weed something.

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Weeding something.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:51.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that her husband is like,

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, here we go again.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.952 align:middle line:90%
And she's, like, demanding.

00:42:54.952 --> 00:42:56.285 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about a meatloaf.

00:42:56.285 --> 00:42:57.470 align:middle line:90%
A meatloaf.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.818 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I'm
making the meatloaf.

00:42:59.818 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that was her
recipe or your mother's recipe.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
about a meatloaf.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was one of the
few things my mother actually

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:90%
could make well.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.871 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:07.871 --> 00:43:09.245 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Isn't that strange?

00:43:09.245 --> 00:43:10.160 align:middle line:90%
That's so funny.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Thats so, so funny.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your sister
has your mother's papers.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
she has everything.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.189 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, she said my
other daughter has my papers.

00:43:18.189 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:90%
So she would have papers.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.500 align:middle line:84%
She would have some
of her school papers

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.955 align:middle line:84%
from when she went to school
even, a long time ago.

00:43:22.955 --> 00:43:23.871 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
very interesting--

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.580 align:middle line:84%
was there anyone near--
connected to Niagara

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.885 align:middle line:84%
Falls or upstate New York
or in that area, please?

00:43:29.885 --> 00:43:30.730 align:middle line:90%
That's where I want to go.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
where I grew up.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.084 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
where you grew up.

00:43:32.084 --> 00:43:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
where we all were.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They're
taking my mind,

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.470 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing it right to the
Niagara Falls and upstate New

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.990 align:middle line:90%
York area.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
the homestead.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's it.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I want to go.

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
these memories are made

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:41.295 align:middle line:90%
and love is created.

00:43:41.295 --> 00:43:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, indeed.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I
love that very much.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.084 align:middle line:84%
And they're still very
much a part of your life.

00:43:46.084 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's thanking
you for helping her

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.490 align:middle line:90%
with the medical decisions.

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:51.215 align:middle line:84%
And helping-- and your
other sister, too.

00:43:51.215 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:84%
She bullied her way in a
little bit, your other sister.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.900 align:middle line:84%
But you did what you
could emotionally

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.750 align:middle line:90%
to help your mother.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going
to tell you that-- what?

00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Tell them what?

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Tell them.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:84%
So she said, I have
to tell you all that,

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:08.690 align:middle line:84%
she said, I was
following my soul.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Her soul had to go through an
experience at the very end.

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if this lady used

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.985 align:middle line:84%
to be very religious
when she was younger.

00:44:15.985 --> 00:44:18.360 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I just want
to feel religious in someway.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I'm
Catholic or what I am.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Her dad was
a Presbyterian minister.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, a
Presbyterian minister.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So she
grew up in a very--

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:25.603 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She would've
read the Bible or something

00:44:25.603 --> 00:44:25.850 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she said even the Bible

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:84%
would have failed me
because it goes beyond that.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know that there's

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.680 align:middle line:90%
a picture of Jesus Christ.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
a big picture

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.720 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred heart of Jesus.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.220 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:36.736 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:44:36.736 --> 00:44:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So she had that.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.060 align:middle line:84%
I want that to be passed on
to family members, she said.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I hope
I can find it.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.395 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
sister has it.

00:44:43.395 --> 00:44:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Ah,
that makes sense.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:45.833 align:middle line:90%

00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:46.851 align:middle line:90%


00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, go on.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Anna.

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:50.882 align:middle line:90%
Someone named Anne?

00:44:50.882 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
her middle name.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.343 align:middle line:84%
It's my sister's and my
mother's middle name.

00:44:55.343 --> 00:44:57.176 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, your
sister, Anne, has it.

00:44:57.176 --> 00:44:58.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:58.960 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Sister Anne has
the sacred heart.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:01.690 align:middle line:90%
And one more thing.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy here.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy here.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy here.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There was a
baby that was lost as well.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She has the baby.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.940 align:middle line:90%
She said to tell you that.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:09.780 align:middle line:90%
She has the baby.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The baby's
over here as well.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Got the baby.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Aw.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
really happy about that.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I know your father's picture
is in that manila envelope.

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:16.860 align:middle line:84%
You take out the
manila envelope,

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and there's his
military uniform.

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Him in the military picture.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:19.855 align:middle line:90%
It's a colored picture.

00:45:19.855 --> 00:45:21.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's in a manila envelope.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And you open it up
and put it back in.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.385 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:45:23.385 --> 00:45:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I do.

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's
very much a man of respect.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.286 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he
lets things happen.

00:45:28.286 --> 00:45:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Did he once buy you a rabbit?

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We had
all kinds of animals,

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:33.020 align:middle line:90%
including rabbit hutch.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.549 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I know at Easter time,

00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:37.340 align:middle line:84%
some people give rabbits,
but they gave you

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.470 align:middle line:90%
a live rabbit or something.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:40.856 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And there was
a joke about the rabbits

00:45:40.856 --> 00:45:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and how fast they reproduce.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I know your daddy wants
to mention something

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.885 align:middle line:84%
about the rabbits
at Easter time.

00:45:44.885 --> 00:45:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and that's it.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.281 align:middle line:90%
And the Good Shepherd.

00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So see if there was a church
that your mother would have

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.770 align:middle line:84%
known or your family would have
known named the Good Shepherd

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.315 align:middle line:84%
Church when you
were a young girl.

00:45:53.315 --> 00:45:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it was
right around the house.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I know we'd have
to walk to church.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.658 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel we have to
take a car necessarily,

00:45:58.658 --> 00:45:59.750 align:middle line:90%
but on a walk to church.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
most of the churches

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:90%
were within walking distance.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I see it.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And I see the Good Shepherd.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to tell
you-- so find it out--

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, I
know what it is.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:84%
The church I grew up in,
which was around the corner,

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.990 align:middle line:84%
there was a huge
picture of Jesus

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.724 align:middle line:90%
as the shepherd with the lambs.

00:46:15.724 --> 00:46:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Maybe that's
called the Good Shepherd.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Check it out.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.080 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee it is.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:90%
I leave you with their love.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.930 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:24.904 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:24.904 --> 00:46:26.365 align:middle line:90%

00:46:26.571 --> 00:46:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to
thank you all very much.

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, everybody,
for being here.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, also, at home.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank Glynis, also,

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.230 align:middle line:84%
for the numbers work that
she did, lady by the numbers

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.045 align:middle line:84%
and "Love by the
Numbers" and Numbers Lady

00:46:38.045 --> 00:46:39.169 align:middle line:90%
and everything that she is.

00:46:39.169 --> 00:46:39.971 align:middle line:90%
She's incredible.

00:46:39.971 --> 00:46:41.312 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:41.312 --> 00:46:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:42.950 align:middle line:90%
And thank you, everyone.

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:43.991 align:middle line:90%
