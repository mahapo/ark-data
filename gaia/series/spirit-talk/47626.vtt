[AUDIENCE CHEERING AND

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.606 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.242 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Nice to have you here,
your lovely faces.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And nicely at home
you're joining us today.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I love sharing this space
here in "Spirit Talk," where

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I take you one step
closer to heaven.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.105 align:middle line:84%
And today I thought we would
talk a little bit, before we

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
get started with the spirit
world, about the chakra system.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So the chakra system, many have
heard about the word chakra,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
but many don't
know what it means.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And the word chakra is
actually a Sanskrit word

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
which means spinning light
or spinning wheel of light.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:90%
We are all light.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
We are spiritual beings
having a human experience.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And as that light,
whenever a clairvoyant

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.895 align:middle line:84%
will look at somebody and they
see them and they look at them,

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:90%
they will see their lights.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
They will see, if you
will, the chakra system.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
The chakra system are made of
beautiful, beautiful lights

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow: reds, orange,
yellows, greens, blues,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.307 align:middle line:90%
purples, and so forth.

00:01:22.307 --> 00:01:24.306 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
today is to work with you

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and talk to you
about the chakras

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and various properties
about the chakras:

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.524 align:middle line:84%
where they're located, what
they look like, et cetera.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So the first chakra
is in the base

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
of the spine, the coccyx
bone many of us know about.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's right here at
the base, right down here

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the spine.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
have some problems

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
in the lower back or the
coccyx bone, stuff like that?

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's very, very interesting
because that tells me

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
it could be, and I'm
not saying definite,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
but it could be an ailment
of not enough energy

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.129 align:middle line:90%
in the first root chakra.

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
It could be also-- you have to
realize the first root chakra,

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's the color of red,
and the first root chakra

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
is really the space or the
center-- it's about survival.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It's about our survival.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It's about our
survival instinct.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And anybody in your
life who are looking

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
to you for their
survival many times

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
will plug into that chakra
and pull your energy

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
from there, siphon
off the energy.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.206 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you feel
this pain down there.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you're
around these people

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.950 align:middle line:84%
all the time who suck
your energy away from you,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and you feel lower
back problems.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Many times it's people who are
really pulling your energy,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:90%
and that's a survival technique.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have proper
balance in that first chakra

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.509 align:middle line:84%
and it's not well-rounded,
it's not expanded,

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
you might find that you
have some problems there.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And it might be problems also
you might be very insecure,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
not sure of yourself, not
loving yourself, not feeling

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:90%
fully grounded within yourself.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
That tells me that there's
not enough red energy

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:90%
in the first root chakra.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%
So isn't that interesting?

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: We'll look at
that in a couple of seconds

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
when we work a little
bit with the meditation,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.128 align:middle line:84%
but that's something
to know about.

00:02:59.128 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the base chakra.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.107 align:middle line:84%
The second chakra is
the orange chakra, yes?

00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is about two
inches below the belly

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:90%
button or the pubic bone, yes?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is also the
first place where

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
we have raw emotion come
through, raw emotion.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's also the sense of self.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense of self.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the first sense
of loving self.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the first sense of having
freedom of choice of self,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
being free and easy and not
so serious in your life.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about
procreation, of course,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
so it's like what do you
want to bring to the world?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
to leave the world?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
produce in the world?

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's all that sort of thing.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Now if I see when I'm reading
the chakras that there's not

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of energy there
in the orange chakra

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
or that it's not
fully expansive,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I know there's been some
issues or there still

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:84%
are some underlying issues
which the person might have

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
had not only today but for
many years, such as abuse

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:84%
issues, sexual issues, abuse
issues, behavioral issues,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.766 align:middle line:90%
addiction issues.

00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
They have all these
different types of things

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
there in that second chakra
about self, a sense of self.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So when we see that
there isn't enough energy

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
in that second chakra,
we have to build it up

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.392 align:middle line:84%
with orange light, and I will do
that, again, in just a second.

00:04:13.392 --> 00:04:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Now that second chakra
is very important,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
because also it is the first
base of the emotional self,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.219 align:middle line:84%
the first chakra of
the emotional self.

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.487 align:middle line:84%
I'll finish with that
in a couple of minutes.

00:04:24.487 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm moving up to
the third chakra, which

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
is the solar plexus, right here,
right near the belly button.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.594 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the expression
go with your gut, yes?

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Go with your gut right here.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a seat of
instinct right here.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a real strong sense of
power of self, power of self.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And it really does
bring assurance of self,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
of really believing
in self even more so.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the second
emotional center,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.805 align:middle line:84%
which means that you feel
more strong within yourself,

00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
you have more
belief in yourself.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%
I am who I am.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Accept me for who I am.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm doing.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm strong within my being.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the second
yellow root chakra,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.367 align:middle line:90%
the instinct, the intuitive.

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of psychics
work very, very much

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
from this third chakra
here or the instinctive.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So go with your gut,
that's where it's located.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
People who have the
third chakra and it's

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
not really well-balanced
or it's not fully expanded

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
or there's not enough
energy in that third chakra,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.850 align:middle line:84%
you'll find these are people
that overpower themselves.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:84%
They find that there's
too much power, ego.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
They're not fully
aware of who they are,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
but they're just really reacting
to the power in that center.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not an expansive power.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just right here.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just power of self,
and it gets a little ego.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And it gets a
little bit-- it can

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:84%
be very abusive as far
as treating people badly.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's this sort of a thing,
so be careful with that.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to go up
further to the heart chakra.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I love working with the
heart chakra right here.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a third emotional center.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
So look at this.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We had the second, the third,
and now the fourth, the heart

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And that two, three,
and four, those chakras

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:84%
are really the centers for
what we call clairsentience.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Clairsentience is a French
word meaning clear sensing.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So for a medium, someone who
uses the sensing of themselves,

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
sensing of the
spirit world, sensing

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:84%
of the world around
them, the physical,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
they'll use the second,
third, and fourth chakra,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:90%
your sensing chakras, OK?

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Second, third, fourth.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, yes?

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
This is the sensing.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So the heart chakra,
lovely chakra, green color.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful chakra for
a sense of balance.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a place of healing.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a place of self-love.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a place for
higher mindedness,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.880 align:middle line:84%
as far as people are concerned,
caring for your neighbor,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
caring for one
another, attitudes

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.420 align:middle line:90%
about the world around you.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual attitudes,
giving, compassion, balance,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
it's all there in that
heart chakra, beautiful.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Emotional self,
strongest emotional self.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's really interesting.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
If that chakra is
closed down, they're

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:90%
not loving themselves enough.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.161 align:middle line:84%
They're not being able to
love into their highest

00:06:56.161 --> 00:06:58.179 align:middle line:84%
capacity, the potential
that they have.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we really want
to work with bringing

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:84%
more energy to that
heart chakra, yes?

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:90%
The green light.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.889 align:middle line:84%
The next chakra
we're going to go to

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:90%
is the throat chakra right here.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the throat right here.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And this is the color blue.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful sky blue.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a wonderful
creative center,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful creative
center, in that

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.652 align:middle line:84%
when I work with a
lot of artists per se

00:07:19.652 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and people that are very
sensitive to the world

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
around them
aesthetically, I'll notice

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:84%
they have very beautiful
blue, blue colors

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:90%
all around the throat chakra.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lovely
center also used

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
for healing work for all
musician work or artist work,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.170 align:middle line:90%
acting work.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Any self-expression comes
from the throat chakra.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So I will many times
work with people,

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and I see that they
are very closed down

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:90%
in the throat chakra.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know that probably someone
told them very, very long ago,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
perhaps when they were children,
that say, you can't say that.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:90%
You're not allowed to say that.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:90%
And they shut right down.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
They stop expressing themselves,
because that was not allowed,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.124 align:middle line:90%
and they tend to live in fear.

00:08:00.124 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I will work
with them and say,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I see your throat chakra
is closed right down.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
What were you not
allowed to express?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.372 align:middle line:84%
What were you not allowed
to say when were a child?

00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably, they'll say,
well, my parents told me this,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:90%
or somebody told me that.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't able to express myself.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So part of the work
with the throat chakra

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is bringing up the energy to
really illuminate and amplify

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
that self-expression and let
that be shining brightly, yes?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- and this is
very, very interesting--

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
as far as mediumship goes
and speaking with spirit,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:84%
I use this throat chakra all
the time, because this throat

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
chakra has to do with what
we call clairaudience.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
Clairaudience means
clear hearing,

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
the French word
mean clear hearing.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear a spirit come
through, which we'll see,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:90%
I will listen.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'll listen
with my psychic ear,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.880 align:middle line:90%
which is really located here.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's this whole
area right here.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So I use the throat
chakra, but it's

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:90%
connected with the psychic ear.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.990 align:middle line:90%
This is all connected.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Now this is very, very
interesting as well.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:84%
When the spirit world come to
me and they want to speak to me,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
they speak to me not,
like, words like hello,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.590 align:middle line:90%
how are you today?

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I hear it very, very
quickly, because they're

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
in such a fast vibration, such a
fast dimension that it's hello,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:90%
you, today very, very quickly.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So I just get snippets, bits
and pieces of information.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Now when the spirit will
come through in that way,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
in that manner,
they will first come

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
through the back of
the neck right here.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
This is a psychic opening.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of eyes
behind your head?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.305 align:middle line:90%
You've heard that expression?

00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very true.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a doorway for the
energy to come through first.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It comes in this way, and
it goes around the neck,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
almost like wearing a necklace.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's really how that works.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.887 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty trippy.

00:09:40.887 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes if you're
around a lot of psyche people

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.344 align:middle line:84%
or if you're around a lot of
crystals, if you go to a place

00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
where there are a
lot of crystals,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.884 align:middle line:84%
there'll be a lot of
amplified energy all the time,

00:09:50.884 --> 00:09:51.616 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:09:51.616 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And you'll walk out of
there with a headache.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time,
it'll come from this area,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much energy
and power coming through here.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
get the headaches.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of
modulation, of modulating

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:84%
the energy of all the
different chakras.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the next chakra
I'm going to talk about

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
is right here, which is
the third eye center.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
You've all heard of
the third eye, yes?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:90%
The third eye center.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's a lovely,
lovely color of indigo.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And this indigo
center right here

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle line:84%
is the site for what we call
clairvoyance, clear sight,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
clairvoyance.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's having visions.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:90%
It's having dreams.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
It's using your imagination.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It's being able to use
your imagination, being

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.121 align:middle line:84%
able to see things
really strongly.

00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not necessarily
talking just

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
about mediumship or psychically
but also your imagination,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
also being able to
visualize things,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.452 align:middle line:84%
also having visualizations
of your own life,

00:10:41.452 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
what you want to
experience in your life,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.769 align:middle line:84%
being able to create
with your vision.

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what that's about.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:90%
That's that third eye center.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:84%
When I use it, I also use
it for my clairvoyance

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and as a medium.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And as a medium, I'm
able to see the spirit.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to use my clairvoyance
to see their faces.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll see sometimes
what they're wearing.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Many times they'll show
me in my mind's eye

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
a scene that I relate to
the person in the audience

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
so they can identify the spirit
or identify that scenario.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.117 align:middle line:84%
So I'm being used
for the clairvoyance.

00:11:13.117 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I never know what the
spirit's going to say,

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:90%
what they're going to do.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.626 align:middle line:84%
They use any of the
abilities they want.

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
They use my
clairsentience, they'll

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
use my throat, my clairaudience,
and also my clairvoyance.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So I never know.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
From spirit to
spirit, it changes.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.196 align:middle line:84%
Just like we're all individuals,
they're also individuals,

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and they come through
very differently.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Now this is very interesting.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
When someone doesn't see
themselves in a loving way,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:84%
feel good about
themselves, really

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
have a sense of the
future about themselves,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I know that that clear
vision is blocked.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.916 align:middle line:90%
I do know that.

00:11:42.916 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I see that when
I work with them.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.395 align:middle line:90%
So that's the other part of it.

00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The last chakra I'm
going to talk about

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.769 align:middle line:84%
is the very top of the
head, which you all

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:90%
know, the crown chakra.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's lovely color of
indigo right at the crown

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:90%
chakra right here.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're all made up of
energy, and this crown chakra

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is really the opening, if you
will, for the higher learning,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the higher connection
to the spirit world.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
It's what we called
inspiration, meaning in spirit.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So this really is the
doorway to inspiration.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So when I see somebody
who's very inspired,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
a creative person,
a poet, a writer,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
someone who's really involved
with higher learning, higher

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
philosophies,
spiritual teachings,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:84%
I will see many, many
times that this top crown

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
chakra is very
brightly lit, very

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
brightly lit in that lovely,
lovely violet light, the violet

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:90%
flame we tend to call it.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's just, just beautiful.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I know that if somebody
doesn't believe, again,

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
in their own sense of self, as
far as inspiration, willingness

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to do things, courage, I
know that sometimes this

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.645 align:middle line:90%
is blocked in the crown chakra.

00:12:47.645 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So we'll work with
that, bringing

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
more of that light energy to
the top of the head, the crown

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's the chakra system.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I hope you got-- it's
a very simplified

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
version of the chakra
system, as you can tell.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And each color, of course, has
a vibration, has a sense of tone

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.507 align:middle line:84%
to it, and it has an
energy associated with it.

00:13:04.507 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And in just a few
minutes, we're going

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.965 align:middle line:84%
to do a little bit of
a visualization for you

00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to get in contact with
that energy center that's

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:90%
really most strongly within you.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So before we do that,
I'm going to open up

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the floor to any questions
here in the audience.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.665 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:17.665 --> 00:13:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing up?

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%
That'd be great.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Not at all.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.293 align:middle line:84%
Would you elaborate a
little bit on the connection

00:13:23.293 --> 00:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
between the chakras
and the energy

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and just expand on that a bit?

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I'd love to.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So the connection
of the chakras,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
it's very much like
flowing energy.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's a flowing stream
of energy, if you will.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
I often think of it as a river,
a river flowing or a tributary

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:90%
is flowing.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It flows up and
down the spine, yes,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:90%
sort of like a serpent in a way.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And each center is
really a concentration

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of a certain energy at
a certain frequency.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And it'll flow up
and down the spine.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:84%
But certain areas, again, if
you were effected emotionally,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:84%
let's say you had a
connection with somebody

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that you had a relationship,
there was a divorce,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:84%
it was a bad breakup,
there's emotional upheaval,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's still
staying within you,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:84%
or there was an abuse
issue, or there's something

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that you felt that you didn't
really feel good about,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
you could have
prevented something,

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
you might have some
guilt about something,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.559 align:middle line:84%
it stays down here
in the power place.

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:84%
If you stay onto that,
you have to remember

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that when you come
from a negative sense,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
that negativity slows
things down, right?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So negativity and fear slow
down that natural flow.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
something that occurred,

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
an upheaval, something
emotionally, or whatever it is,

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
even a physical that
happened, many times it'll

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
slow the energy, and it
doesn't flow correctly.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So how can you make
it flow better?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.745 align:middle line:84%
By using more concentrated
energy, meditation.

00:14:42.745 --> 00:14:45.035 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
also have certain foods

00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:46.902 align:middle line:84%
which will amplify
the certain energy

00:14:46.902 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
points, the certain chakras
points, certain minerals,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.379 align:middle line:90%
certain foods.

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You can have salt baths with
certain ingredients in it,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.922 align:middle line:90%
which will also enhance it.

00:14:53.922 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to
certain types of music,

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:84%
because every
single chakra point

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
is attuned to a
certain chord of music.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Even the clothes
that you're wearing--

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.140 align:middle line:84%
let's say that you
need more energy.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
If you tend to wear red,
you're bringing more energy

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
to the first chakra, so
there's more energy there.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you need to feel
more loving about yourself,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:90%
wearing green, self-love.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.545 align:middle line:84%
Everything being energy,
and the chakra points

00:15:16.545 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:84%
are concentrated energy
in the body, the spirit

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:90%
body, concentrated energy, yes?

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you,
if you go to your closet

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
in the morning or your drawer
and you tend to pick out

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.634 align:middle line:84%
a certain color clothing,
what does that mean?

00:15:28.634 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Or if you like to go
with certain colors

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
around your environment, more
blues or more pinks or more

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
reds, they mean
something to you.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit is trying to help
you to amplify, if you will,

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
those energy points of the
body, the colors that you need,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
the vibration that you need,
and the frequency that you need

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
within your body,
within your being,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll say, within your being.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So my audience
here today, they're

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.214 align:middle line:84%
wearing a variety of
clothing, of colored clothing.

00:15:55.214 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you
why you wore this color.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
you're wearing red.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Because I wanted to
stand out in the audience when

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.529 align:middle line:90%
I saw myself on TV.

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Red is
a real strong energy.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.205 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's very strong.

00:16:05.205 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
It's strong energy.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And my house is
decorated-- every room has red.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I like red.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You like red,
which means that you need more

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
energy around you,
believe it or not.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.463 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Now this
is very interesting,

00:16:15.463 --> 00:16:17.010 align:middle line:84%
because in olden
days-- olden days,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.843 align:middle line:84%
maybe they still do it
in some restaurants--

00:16:18.843 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:84%
they used to always have red
paint or red wallpaper with red

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:90%
tablecloths.

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do that?

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: To
make you eat faster.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:26.528 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Make
you eat faster,

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:27.740 align:middle line:90%
so the turnaround is quicker.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much faster
energy, that red.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.310 align:middle line:90%
So go, go, go, go.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Why would they have
hospitals-- they

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
used to paint the hospital
rooms in greens and blues.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Healing.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Healing.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.485 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:16:40.485 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
interesting, because when

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.562 align:middle line:84%
you go to-- let's say you're
watching a storefront,

00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:84%
you go down the street, and
you're looking at a storefront,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:84%
you will react intrinsically
within your being

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:90%
and all your chakra points.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
You will react to what
that window looks like.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:84%
On another level,
you'll be like that.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
When you meet
someone face-to-face,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
react with the colors

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
you feel from them, not
only from their clothing,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:84%
but also what you're feeling
from them on the chakra levels.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So there'll be
some colors that'll

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.819 align:middle line:84%
be standing out
more than others.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:90%
So interesting.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
share with you now is

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.952 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to do a little
bit of a little meditation

00:17:12.952 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:84%
or a visualization,
and I really want

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you to try and intrinsically
feel the chakra points

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and actually bring more
color to various points which

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
I speak about.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Now I also want you to
notice something as well.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
When you go into this
little meditation

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and this instinctive,
if you will, exercise,

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to pay attention
what energy, what color you

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
have seem to have less of and
what you seem to have more of.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.725 align:middle line:90%
This is not a judgment.

00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:90%
It is not a judgment.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.725 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to kind of feel
what you have more color of

00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and what you have less color of.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I point
out various colors,

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.604 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just
feel intuitively

00:17:51.604 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
what feels right to you, what
feels more, what feels less.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask you
just to close your eyes,

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.204 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going
to speak to you.

00:17:58.204 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:90%
[MEDITATIVE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Just listen to the
sound of my voice,

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and just become mindful
of your feet on the floor.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of your bodies,
sitting in the chairs,

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:90%
lying down.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Wherever you are, that's fine.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Just listen to my voice.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
be mindful of the body.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful of your feet.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of your connection
to Mother Earth, lovely Gaia,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Earth, that we also
as spiritual beings

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
are very much a part
of Gaia, Mother Earth.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:90%
We are connected to her.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
We're not limited to
the physical body,

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
but our energy, our spirit is
also part of the Earth energy.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So just be mindful of that
and take a deep breath.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.917 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:18:48.917 --> 00:18:50.605 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] Great.

00:18:50.605 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And now place your mind
and your imagination

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:90%
on the base of your spine.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to see a
red light, a red circle there.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful of that
beautiful red circle of light.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you put
that in your mind,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
also become aware
intuitively of what

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
you feel with the red, what
comes into your mind, what

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:18.470 align:middle line:90%
you sense in that red chakra.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect
with that red chakra,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
just be aware if there's anybody
else in that center, anyone

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:84%
else's energy that's
sitting in that center.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Just be mindful of that.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.401 align:middle line:90%
No judgement, just observation.

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go a little higher

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:84%
with our imagination, our mind,
two inches below the belly

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:84%
button, top of the pubic
bone, bright orange light,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:90%
a bright orange circle.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And just as you connect
with that orange chakra,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:84%
that second chakra, you will
be mindful of how it feels.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%
What does that color feel like?

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:90%
What does that center feel like?

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It feels a little bit
different than the red.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And as you feel the orange
light, that orange chakra,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.706 align:middle line:84%
what awareness comes
into your mind?

00:20:11.706 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
What awareness comes
into your mind?

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Are there people that
come into your mind,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
an energy that comes
into your mind?

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is is fine.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just observing,
not judging.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.038 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:20:28.038 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.695 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
go two inches higher,

00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
two inches above the
belly button, actually.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's a yellow light.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:90%
That's your solar plexus.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine a
beautiful yellow circle

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.700 align:middle line:84%
of light in the solar plexus
area, a beautiful yellow, round

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:90%
sun of light.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And this the center there
for sensing, feeling.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So as you attune yourself
to that third chakra

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
point, that yellow center,
what comes across your mind?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:90%
What feelings do you have?

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.985 align:middle line:84%
What do you sense as you connect
with that beautiful third

00:21:07.985 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
chakra point in your
gut, your intuition?

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Is there anyone's energy there?

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
If you seem to feel someone's
energy there, see them.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
If they come across your
mind, what do you sense?

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Is there any part of that
center which seems out

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.995 align:middle line:90%
of balance or out of alignment?

00:21:30.995 --> 00:21:32.682 align:middle line:90%
Now take a deep breath.

00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:34.879 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And
exhale. [EXHALES AUDIBLY]

00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
go up to our heart

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
chakra, a beautiful
green light in the heart,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:84%
beautiful center for healing,
compassion, unconditional love.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful green light
of healing is so beautiful,

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I just love being there.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
As you scan that green
light, that green center,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that green chakra, become
mindful of any energy

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
you feel in that center.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge it.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Just observe it.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Is anyone there,
any old hurts, any

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
old emotions you're
still holding onto?

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Just see it and let it go.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.344 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:22:19.344 --> 00:22:21.435 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And
exhale. [EXHALES AUDIBLY]

00:22:21.435 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And now to your throat chakra,
which is blue, bright blue,

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.645 align:middle line:90%
sky blue.

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And just place yourself
in that throat chakra,

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
being mindful of
the self-expression.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you fully express yourself?

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you hold yourself back
from expressing yourself?

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Just become mindful of any
energies that are there,

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
any faces that you see,
anything holding you back

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:90%
from self-expression.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.727 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:22:48.727 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And
exhale. [EXHALES AUDIBLY]

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Now go to your third eye center.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The site of clairvoyance,
a beautiful indigo color,

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
the circle of light, right
in the eyebrows, right there.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
This is how you
see clearly, having

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
visions, seeing your future,
imaginations, dreams as well.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect yourself with
that center, what do you find?

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:84%
What's holding you back
from seeing things clearly?

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:84%
What's holding you back from
seeing spirits all around you?

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.390 align:middle line:84%
What's holding you
back from seeing truth,

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
your own truth or
those around you?

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Just being mindful, not
judging, but observing.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.636 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:23:36.636 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY]

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And now place your awareness
on the top of the head

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
where the crown
chakra is located.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
beautiful indigo colors,

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:84%
circle of light of
indigo, the doorway

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual worlds,
the higher worlds

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:90%
of learning, the etheric worlds.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Your guides and your
teachers connect with you

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:90%
in the crown chakra.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So just be mindful of what
the atmosphere around the top

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:84%
of the head feels like,
that indigo color.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Are you open-minded?

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Are you there to learn higher
truths, philosophies, prayers?

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.974 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel
when you connect

00:24:18.974 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
with that atmosphere
at the crown chakra

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.660 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the head?

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Not judging, just observing.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] And slowly

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.576 align:middle line:90%
open up your eyes and be as one.

00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:37.543 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:24:37.543 --> 00:24:38.043 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:43.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.235 align:middle line:90%
Did you like that?

00:24:44.235 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIENCE RESPONDING
 AFFIRMATIVELY]

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:44.945 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:44.945 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.637 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to ask
you, any reactions

00:24:48.637 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
that you had with that
little visualization?

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Anybody surprised about certain
reactions that they had?

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:90%
And over here.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: My right
arm started shaking.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Your right
arm started shaking.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to tell you why
your right arm started shaking.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a man next to you who
would be a husband of yours

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that passed to the
world of the spirit.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:90%
And I know he'd be next to you.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:90%
So I know he was touching you.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:90%
He touched you at one point.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I was
watching everybody.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.450 align:middle line:84%
When we worked with
the heart center,

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I saw him go next
to you and hug you,

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:90%
and he was on this side of you.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:90%

>> VAN PRAAGH: So what I want to
do is I'm going to connect with

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
you, because as we are working,
I saw this gentleman coming

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
here, and he feels like your
husband and he feels like

your father.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
He talks about his
daughter, first of all.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.185 align:middle line:84%
And he said you cause a lot
of problems for yourself.

00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.726 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So why don't
you stand up too, honey.

00:25:40.726 --> 00:25:41.506 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:42.345 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hey, mom.

00:25:42.345 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.590 align:middle line:90%
What is your name, darling?

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Cathy.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Cathy.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.126 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And your mom's?

00:25:46.126 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mary Jo.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mary Jo.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.946 align:middle line:84%
So this man is between
the both of you,

00:25:49.946 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and the man is referring
to being your father

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.415 align:middle line:84%
and is referring to
a scar on your leg.

00:25:53.415 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:90%
You know about that?

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's the
significance about that scar

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
on your leg, but your
father wants me--

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
he's coming into my
mind here, and he

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
wants me very much to
point that out to you.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why, but he wants

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:84%
me to point-- it's a long
time you've had that scar.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I don't
know if you fell off something

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:90%
or you fell off somewhere.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: A bicycle.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.791 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: A bicycle.

00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Got infected, did it?

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.242 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Well,
they worked on it.

00:26:13.242 --> 00:26:14.616 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
They worked on it.

00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:90%
So I know that--

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And he prayed on
it, and from there it healed.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I know from this day
your father is telling me

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that your walk is not completely
right, because sometimes I

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.904 align:middle line:90%
feel it right here.

00:26:25.904 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
I'm going to tell you,

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
your dad is talking about
knee problem, by the way.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
That was the same leg that I
injured my knee as a child.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Because I feel the knee problem.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.200 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me a feeling
of being knee problem.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Now as this man comes through,
I want to come to you, darling,

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and I want to tell you that July
for some reason is significant.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.786 align:middle line:84%
So he's making me feel about
July, the month of July

00:26:44.786 --> 00:26:45.745 align:middle line:90%
is significant for you.

00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:90%
We had a daughter born in July.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, is
it your birthday, then?

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:51.110 align:middle line:90%
July.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So he's really impact July,
and it's very significant.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.306 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
has been some talk

00:26:55.306 --> 00:26:56.892 align:middle line:90%
about-- I understand that.

00:26:56.892 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Are there two others in
the family besides you?

00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:59.825 align:middle line:90%
There are two others?

00:26:59.825 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: There's lots more.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: There's more.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:01.955 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There's
four all together.

00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Uh-huh.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: There's
four children.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Were there two
others that did not make it?

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Did you have some miscarriages?

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I did.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
did, didn't you?

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Because he said there
were two miscarriages,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and he has them over
on the other side.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.880 align:middle line:90%
He's a very, very lovely man.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I just got to tell you that
his energy's very, very, very

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.266 align:middle line:90%
strong.

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:16.765 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
a Joseph as well.

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:18.654 align:middle line:84%
So there'd be a Joseph
in the spirit world.

00:27:18.654 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
You understand the
Joseph, please?

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.485 align:middle line:90%
Where's Joseph?

00:27:21.485 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Joseph would
have been my grandfather.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that Joseph
wants to stand here with us,

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and I know Joseph
is very significant.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.669 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give you
love from this man, OK?

00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I think you might have
known him as a little girl

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.570 align:middle line:84%
or might have seen him and
very quickly, because then I

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:84%
think he must have passed
when you were a young girl,

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.731 align:middle line:90%
but he passed over.

00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:39.495 align:middle line:84%
But I think you did
know him, because he

00:27:39.495 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:90%
said he knew you physically.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.775 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:40.775 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I also want to
talk about he wants to bring me

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:90%
to some steps--

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: --and
I want to be very,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:84%
very careful on those steps,
because someone almost had

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.758 align:middle line:90%
a fall or a spill on the steps.

00:27:50.758 --> 00:27:52.383 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That
happens all the time.

00:27:52.383 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.295 align:middle line:90%
It was icy.

00:27:54.295 --> 00:27:55.185 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because I've got
to tell you that he's talking

00:27:55.185 --> 00:27:57.675 align:middle line:90%
to me about your husband passes.

00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:59.550 align:middle line:84%
He might have been ill
for just a little bit.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.633 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:28:00.633 --> 00:28:02.162 align:middle line:84%
And did his mind
go a little bit?

00:28:02.162 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Did
his mind go, you see?

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.918 align:middle line:84%
Because he's talking
about his mind went.

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:07.360 align:middle line:90%
He said, my mind was not mine.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.221 align:middle line:90%
How funny.

00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's very true.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
very true, isn't it?

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.145 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know
about crossword puzzles,

00:28:12.145 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and I know about doing the
crossword puzzles and the word

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:90%
puzzles.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Did he used
to do those all the time,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.410 align:middle line:90%
and do you understand that?

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, I do.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And you do them.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And do you still do
them every day, please?

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because I need to
let you know that your husband

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.781 align:middle line:84%
is with you when you do the
crossword puzzles every single

00:28:26.781 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.290 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's where
the voice comes through.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's
where it comes through.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Very, very much so.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Very, very much so.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there must
have been a heart problem here

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.762 align:middle line:90%
with you?

00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Well, yes.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Because he's referring to the
heart, a little heart problem.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So I don't know
if there's some ventricle,

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%
there was a ventricle
problem with you.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:90%
He said the ventricle.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.445 align:middle line:84%
So I know there'd be
a ventricle problem.

00:28:47.445 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.484 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have a
blood clot in my aorta.

00:28:51.484 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mm hmm.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:90%
So he's just telling you that.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:90%
He's making me feel that.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
He's making me feel very
much connected with that.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's some Irish
people in the background

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.516 align:middle line:90%
here as well.

00:29:02.516 --> 00:29:03.765 align:middle line:90%
There's an Irish feeling here.

00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's your
family or his family,

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
but I'm getting a very
Irish feeling here.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And I need to let you know
Mc-something, Mc-something

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.170 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I need to let you know that
I know that the heart thing is

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.220 align:middle line:84%
not done yet, so I know that
you've either been-- they want

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.741 align:middle line:84%
to either do a procedure or
you had to have a procedure,

00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:21.865 align:middle line:84%
but I know something is
not finished with that yet.

00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.486 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: We're waiting
for the clot to dissolve.

00:29:24.486 --> 00:29:25.230 align:middle line:90%
They're hoping.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.055 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's an art form.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm positive.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So, my love, I
just got to let you

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.987 align:middle line:84%
know that this
man, your husband,

00:29:31.987 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
is telling me that
either they're giving you

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
some medicine for it to dissolve
and you recently either changed

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.069 align:middle line:84%
the medicine or they
gave you something

00:29:39.069 --> 00:29:40.985 align:middle line:84%
on top of that other
medicine you were taking.

00:29:40.985 --> 00:29:41.682 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:29:41.682 --> 00:29:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you very much.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:90%
He's telling me that.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:44.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's telling me.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.280 align:middle line:90%
That's very specific, isn't it?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
very, very specific.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to pay very,
very close attention to the salt

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:90%
that you're taking in.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.264 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why, but there's

00:29:53.264 --> 00:29:54.950 align:middle line:84%
something about the
salt levels or salt,

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
either you had to
cut the salt out.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just very leery--
now I'm not a doctor,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:90%
but I'm telling you something.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Your husband makes me feel--

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.166 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's
over here, by the way.

00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is behind me, and
she's laughing her head off.

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Laughing her head off.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's also someone
named Cathleen or Catherine

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.211 align:middle line:90%
or something over here as well.

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.309 align:middle line:90%
It's a Cathy or Catherine.

00:30:14.309 --> 00:30:15.267 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's me.

00:30:15.267 --> 00:30:16.081 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's my daughter.

00:30:16.081 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm Catherine.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is
that your name?

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I'm hearing this
lady saying Catherine to me.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:19.865 align:middle line:90%
So that's you.

00:30:19.865 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, your mother's here.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Your mother's here very strong.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And she can walk.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.090 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:84%
She can get around,
and she can walk again.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So she couldn't
have walked when she was

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth at the end.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She couldn't
walk at the end of her life.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:90%
She's saying that.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:32.985 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right.

00:30:32.985 --> 00:30:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And now she's
telling me she's able to do

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:90%
that, OK?

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.741 align:middle line:90%
And Yeah, go on.

00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.110 align:middle line:90%
They're all here for you.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.400 align:middle line:90%
There's a brother also.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.497 align:middle line:84%
There must be a
brother passed over,

00:30:39.497 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:90%
because he's here as well.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Steve.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And I want it to be him,
and he's just so emotional.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Because I got to tell you.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I can see his eyes.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:90%
He can see again.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was a problem with
an eye at one point with him.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that, please?

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.138 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you And
I know that he's telling me he

00:30:54.138 --> 00:30:55.250 align:middle line:90%
can see again.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
He says it's like
having brand new eyes,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.397 align:middle line:90%
and I love that with him.

00:30:58.397 --> 00:30:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you that they're all

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
concerned about the
medicine that you're taking.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.572 align:middle line:84%
So it's the second one
that they just gave you.

00:31:04.572 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the second
one that goes along

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:90%
with that other one you were on.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And you've either
been taking it for two months,

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:90%
two weeks.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a new--

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Two weeks.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Two weeks.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Two weeks.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: You got it.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Two weeks.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right on.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Two weeks.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:18.245 align:middle line:84%
So I want you, please,
to look into that.

00:31:18.245 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Catherine, would you
help that, please?

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.108 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because if they
come this far and to discuss

00:31:23.108 --> 00:31:25.994 align:middle line:84%
it, I want to make sure that
you take care of yourself.

00:31:25.994 --> 00:31:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And so look at
the chemical makeup of that

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.797 align:middle line:90%
second medication.

00:31:29.797 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I will.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Please.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new house
around one of you.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
if you're looking

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:84%
for a new house or
someone in the family's

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:84%
looking at a new house
or wanting to move.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It would
probably be me down the road.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm helping you with
that, so let me know that.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Really?

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:42.960 align:middle line:90%
All right, sweethearts?

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I apprecaite it.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.755 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

00:31:44.755 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful person.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's so funny,
because as I tune in, I tend

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to come over to this area
here, and I have a man here,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and he wants to be known to me.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say that
this man feels to me,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably
early 70s now,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking about
a father figure.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.790 align:middle line:90%
And I know that I'm in my 70s.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm strong.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I would not have come
to something like this.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And I got to go then.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like I'm-- OK.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you that whoever's

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
here in the audience
for this man,

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you
that either you almost

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
didn't make it here or almost
weren't supposed to make it,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.730 align:middle line:90%
and this man comes here--

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:23.880 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.310 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to figure out how
to say this to me in my head.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.089 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:28.089 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So the person in the
audience, either you almost

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.280 align:middle line:84%
didn't make it or you're
taking somebody else's seat

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.240 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.895 align:middle line:84%
So does that make
sense to somebody?

00:32:35.895 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:90%
What about you?

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, to the man.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.065 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is
it your father?

00:32:40.065 --> 00:32:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's my father.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Do you
mind coming up on stage?

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:42.625 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And we'll do
a reading on stage for you.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So Anne, I just want
to tune into you,

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.985 align:middle line:84%
because I had a man
here that passed over.

00:32:46.985 --> 00:32:48.520 align:middle line:84%
It felt like a father
figure for you.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.788 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And before
he passed over, Anne,

00:32:50.788 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:90%
I need to tell you something.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to do a couple
of things with you.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I first want you to
work with these cards.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.570 align:middle line:84%
These are cards
that I just created

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
called Talking to Heaven
cards with Doreen Virtue.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And these are cards which
are mediumship cards,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and what they are is your way of
contacting spirit on your own.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And you at home, you
can do this on your own.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.722 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a medium
to contact spirit.

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Believe it or not, you don't.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I would love that.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:13.706 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:13.706 --> 00:33:15.470 align:middle line:84%
So hold those cards,
Anne, and I want

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.410 align:middle line:84%
you to put your energy
into those cards

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and shuffle them all around.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you're shuffling
those cards around,

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.210 align:middle line:90%
dad is right behind you.

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a grandmother
next to you

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.650 align:middle line:84%
as well-- that would be his
mother-- that's next to you.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to think of your dad

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:28.169 align:middle line:90%
as you shuffle those cards.

00:33:28.169 --> 00:33:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you to do is as
you're shuffling those cards,

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I want you also to
think of a question

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:90%
you want to ask your dad.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And just think of your dad.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.965 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:33:35.965 --> 00:33:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Good, you got it now.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.509 align:middle line:90%
How'd you see that?

00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because he
comes closer to you that way.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:84%
When we open ourselves up and
open up our energy field--

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was going to
ask a shallow question and then

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:90%
something more important--

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: No,
no, don't tell us.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: --came up.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Don't tell us.

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want to
ask, don't tell us.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel it's
ready to put the cards down,

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.476 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to pick one card.

00:33:53.476 --> 00:33:55.154 align:middle line:84%
You can spread it
out on the table.

00:33:55.154 --> 00:33:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: This one.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Spread them
out on the table first.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.778 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to
spread them out.

00:33:58.778 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Spread them all out, and then
I want you instinctively,

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.650 align:middle line:84%
intuitively to feel when
you want the right answer

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:84%
from your father to pick the
card that comes out to you.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.604 align:middle line:90%
What is the question?

00:34:14.604 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Did
he appreciate me?

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And the answer
is "I have a new understanding."

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So you can take them again
and put them together.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.031 align:middle line:90%
And those are yours.

00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:32.989 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Those are yours to use.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.535 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tune
in with your day,

00:34:36.535 --> 00:34:38.993 align:middle line:84%
because I have him right-- he's
standing right next to you.

00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:40.397 align:middle line:90%
He is with you in the car.

00:34:40.397 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And you asked him on
the way here in the car

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.980 align:middle line:90%
to please show up.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I did.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:45.901 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I'm here.

00:34:45.901 --> 00:34:47.400 align:middle line:84%
He's also talked
to me about someone

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:84%
must have grown up Catholic
or was religious growing up.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.585 align:middle line:84%
Did someone go to a church
and light a candle for him?

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Just after he passed,
I got a phone call.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what it was.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It was a cross I was seeing, and
I'm seeing candles and, like,

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:84%
a church, like going into this
church and lighting a candle.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.910 align:middle line:84%
A new friend of mine that
was in Santa Fe at the time

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
lit a candle for
my father while I

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.530 align:middle line:84%
was trying to make
some decisions.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.840 align:middle line:90%
My parents passed 20 hours--

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Don't tell me.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell me.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell me.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to let
you know that something

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.107 align:middle line:84%
about a military
connection as well.

00:35:18.107 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Wait, don't tell me.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.410 align:middle line:90%
You just say yes or no.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It
makes it much easier.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.936 align:middle line:90%
Never feed the medium.

00:35:22.936 --> 00:35:23.634 align:middle line:90%
Say yes or no.

00:35:23.634 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:26.800 align:middle line:90%
Your dad is right here.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:84%
He's a very-- can I
say?-- a regimented man.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:90%
He likes schedules.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:31.015 align:middle line:90%
He likes details.

00:35:31.015 --> 00:35:33.240 align:middle line:84%
He even has a calendar
that he used to cross off.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.485 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:35.455 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: [LAUGHS]

00:35:35.455 --> 00:35:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: [LOUDLY] Yes.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.165 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:38.165 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And he used to
cross off that calendar all

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:84%
the time, and he had to make
sure his checkbooks were

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.880 align:middle line:90%
exactly right.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone caused
problems with his systems--

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.142 align:middle line:84%
he said his systems-- he
would argue with them.

00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So I know there
would have been a time where he

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:54.448 align:middle line:84%
either went to the bank and
argued about something with his

00:35:54.448 --> 00:35:56.990 align:middle line:84%
checkbook was wrong or something
was not adding up correctly,

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.739 align:middle line:84%
and he would have done
this sort of thing.

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to go back
a little bit in time,

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want you
to think of him as older.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think of him more
of as younger than older, OK?

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:90%
I know that you must have--

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.790 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to me about
a pair of glasses of his.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Who owns a pair
of glasses, then?

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Do you own his pair of glasses?

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you have someone's glasses?

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.205 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have his old
Ray-Bans from when he was

00:36:17.205 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:90%
a fighter pilot.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And from when he was
in the military, then.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So I know also that you would
have a photograph of him

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.300 align:middle line:84%
in that military uniform
and in about that time.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that that would
be at a time in his life

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.710 align:middle line:90%
where he really appears now.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.140 align:middle line:84%
That's how he shows
himself to me.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.556 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
the time he would

00:36:34.556 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:90%
be late 20s, this sort of time.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know there was moving
around a lot, he said,

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:84%
so there must have
been moving around.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
the military family.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You had to go from
place to place to place,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
but he always had to go from
place to place to place.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:90%
That make sense to you?

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: He did, yes.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.221 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:51.829 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
mom, she's also passed,

00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:52.620 align:middle line:90%
your mother, right?

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:90%
She comes in with him.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
She's right on the
left side of you.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
She's on this side of you,
and he's on this side.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.596 align:middle line:84%
Now that's because he's
communicating with me,

00:36:59.596 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:90%
but she's over here.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Now she wants to
give you her love,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and she said she
had-- Oh, I'm getting

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.540 align:middle line:90%
very emotional with your mother.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.777 align:middle line:84%
She wished she
went when she did.

00:37:09.777 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I know.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You know that?

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
the timing was a little weird

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.985 align:middle line:90%
when they passed.

00:37:13.985 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
They passed very close
to each other, right?

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: 20 hours.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Two weeks?

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.394 align:middle line:90%
20 hours.

00:37:17.394 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Two,
you got the two.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It was at 20.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: 20 hours.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So I know there'd be definitely
some connection as far

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.970 align:middle line:84%
as them passing,
and it was too much.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:28.845 align:middle line:90%
Mom couldn't bear it.

00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:29.170 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Mom couldn't bear it.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Mom was like [GAGS].

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
change for everybody.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:34.660 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Was there Air Force?

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Was it Air Force
around your dad?

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Because Air Force, very much so.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to go to
Germany for some reason.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's
where he was.

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: In
one of the places.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, Germany is
where he's giving me,

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.585 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very strongly
connected with Germany,

00:37:47.585 --> 00:37:49.810 align:middle line:90%
as far as I'm identifying with.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.935 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Now your mom
is telling me also she's very

00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:90%
happy where she's at.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.536 align:middle line:90%
They all came to greet her.

00:37:55.536 --> 00:37:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Now her mother and father,
are they both over there

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.450 align:middle line:90%
as well, please?

00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And do you
have a sister as well?

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:01.655 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because I want
to give love to your sister,

00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:02.402 align:middle line:90%
who's here.

00:38:02.402 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your mom's with
her, her mother and father.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
family over there too.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.685 align:middle line:84%
I also tell you there's
somebody that could not walk.

00:38:09.685 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I say not walk,
someone had either--

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, I know.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.565 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: --it
was an amputee--

00:38:12.565 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like
I have my legs back.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.705 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I feel like my
legs are back and I got to say

00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:19.205 align:middle line:90%
that to you.

00:38:19.205 --> 00:38:20.431 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:23.140 align:middle line:84%
She was part of our
family, not officially.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Was someone
helping her out then?

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Was it a wheelchair at
one point she was in?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because
she knows your mom.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:84%
She's very connected
with your mother.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Because she's very
connected with your mother,

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and she wants me to
tell you she's here.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know why, but
I'm just waving to you

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:90%
and I'm thanking you.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm blowing you kisses,
blowing you kisses.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.012 align:middle line:84%
Now this lady is talking
about sewing things.

00:38:43.012 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.678 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So you'd
remember her, she said,

00:38:45.678 --> 00:38:46.697 align:middle line:90%
as sewing things.

00:38:46.697 --> 00:38:47.530 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I know there'd be a
sewing basket there.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I know she would
sew the buttons on.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:51.524 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:51.524 --> 00:38:52.400 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.132 align:middle line:84%
She had jars and
jars of buttons.

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is that right?

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.131 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, from
the Depression era.

00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:90%
So she saved everything.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And she would make us dolls
and our dolls' clothes

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:90%
from pieces of cloth for us.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: But buttons
and buttons and buttons.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:90%

take old rags as well.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Anything.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Cotton.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.586 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I know she
would take newspaper also,

00:39:11.586 --> 00:39:12.316 align:middle line:90%
she's showing me.

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:13.947 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Stacks and
stacks of newspaper from

00:39:13.947 --> 00:39:14.755 align:middle line:90%
the Depression era.

00:39:14.755 --> 00:39:15.630 align:middle line:90%
She saved everything.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: But she's showing
me the newspaper to made with

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.220 align:middle line:90%
those dolls.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She was
using them for the stuffing

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:19.970 align:middle line:90%
of the dolls.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.368 align:middle line:90%
What did you say?

00:39:21.368 --> 00:39:22.090 align:middle line:90%
She's funny.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:84%
She's also telling
me, well, I used

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to clean the windows with
the newspaper as well.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh,
yeah, with vinegar.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.210 align:middle line:90%
And the newspaper.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.085 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's
very interesting.

00:39:29.085 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Now do you remember then your
parents giving you a bracelet

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.390 align:middle line:84%
that would have-- what
do they call that,

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:38.207 align:middle line:84%
the little things on
it?-- charm bracelet.

00:39:38.207 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have
my grandmother's--

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:40.435 align:middle line:84%

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So grandma wants to say you

Great.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, she's giving me
the sense in my head,

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:84%
this feeling here, that you
do have her charm bracelet,

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and she's honored by that.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to tell
me that-- she's really

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:90%
making me feel emotional.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:90%

>> AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:40:05.746 --> 00:40:06.302 align:middle line:90%

00:40:08.968 --> 00:40:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And if I come
to you now with sunflowers,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that's going to
mean something for you.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.030 align:middle line:90%

And I want you to continue
the great way you are,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.020 align:middle line:84%
because I know your
mom and dad are

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.650 align:middle line:90%
very proud of who you've become.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:90%

your dad feels like
he passes quickly too.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Your dad passes,

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want
to stick around.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.890 align:middle line:90%
He wants to get out of here.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.912 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he believed
in life after death.

>> AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:40:37.786 --> 00:40:39.661 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Don't
think he believed in it.

00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:40.730 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't his cup of tea.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:90%
He was very black and white.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.770 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to control things.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:46.875 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I just
wanted to let you know that.

00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:47.830 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.295 align:middle line:84%
So they're all
around you, so I'm

00:40:49.295 --> 00:40:50.220 align:middle line:90%
going to leave you with that.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, it's fantastic.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, darling?

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.607 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Absolutely--

00:40:51.607 --> 00:40:52.361 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All
right, sweetheart.

00:40:52.361 --> 00:40:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: --fantastic.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.652 align:middle line:90%
What a blessing.

00:40:53.652 --> 00:40:54.108 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, sweetheart.

00:40:54.108 --> 00:40:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It was
such a blessing.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, sweetheart.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.500 align:middle line:90%
That was really, really great.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.879 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:40:59.879 --> 00:41:00.628 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
talk a little bit

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and just finish up
with the chakras.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So I had you do that little
visualization with the colors.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Another way people
often talk about when

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.580 align:middle line:84%
you work with the chakras
and you open up those colors

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:84%
by concentrating on
them, there should

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.364 align:middle line:84%
be another way of closing
down the chakra system.

00:41:16.364 --> 00:41:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So just a way to close
down the chakra system,

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.590 align:middle line:90%
you just close your eyes again.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to close you
down, because you don't

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.080 align:middle line:84%
want all that amplification
in those channels.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to close them down.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.573 align:middle line:84%
So you start with the top of
the head, the crown chakra,

00:41:26.573 --> 00:41:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and I just want you to
imagine a beautiful waterfall

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.830 align:middle line:84%
just coming down on top of
you and closing down the crown

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
chakra there and going down to
the third eye and the throat.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have a beautiful
indigo, violet,

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.610 align:middle line:84%
we have that beautiful
violet color.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Just bring that waterfall
down to the third eye indigo,

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.470 align:middle line:84%
waterfall down,
throat, which is blue,

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:54.050 align:middle line:84%
at the heart, green, solar
plexus, yellow, second chakra,

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.642 align:middle line:90%
orange, finally the red.

00:41:56.642 --> 00:41:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And the red, just
any excess energy

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:84%
go down to feet to
Mother Earth to receive.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.772 align:middle line:84%
So try that, you friends,
and then the close,

00:42:03.772 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and feel that love
that's all around you.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.035 align:middle line:84%
And you also, at home,
feel the love and light

00:42:07.035 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit world around
you until we meet again.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for joining me.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.301 align:middle line:90%
Thank you everyone.

00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:29.334 align:middle line:90%
