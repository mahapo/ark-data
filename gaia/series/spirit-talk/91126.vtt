>>ANNOUNCER: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.975 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:34.915 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone!

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.891 align:middle line:84%
And thank everyone
for watching also

00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:45.140 align:middle line:84%
for another episode of "Spirit
Talk," where I take you

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you all for
being here today, joining us.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And today, I thought we would
talk about something which

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.106 align:middle line:84%
I think affects
every single person.

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So everybody sitting
here and at home, I just

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
want you to just
look back at what's

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:84%
going on with you right
now at this moment,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
this particular
moment right now.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
You are a total summation
of all the experiences

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%
you've ever had in your life.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I would say past lives
as well, but we're not

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:90%
going to go back that far.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to stay in
this current life right here.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So just look back
and I just want

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
you to see what
influenced your life

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:90%
to make you who you are today.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So as I look at
your faces, I just

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
want you to look back at your
life and just assess your life.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
be honest, which is fine,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
because this is just
for your own benefit.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And just ask
yourself what energy,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
what belief systems, what old
patterns, what guilt, what

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
relationships, what energy
am I holding onto presently

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that does not serve
my highest good?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one, isn't it?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So I believe-- and as I
was driving here today

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.895 align:middle line:84%
to the studio, spirit
just gave me this

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:84%
into my mind to really share
with everybody to do this,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's a real
healing in that.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Every single day is a
new opportunity to grow.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Every single day.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And I, today, along with
my friends in the spirit,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
want you to sit in
a moment of healing

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and sit in a moment
of releasing.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.302 align:middle line:84%
So today's show is
called Letting Go.

00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
going to be letting

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.964 align:middle line:84%
go of the old stuff that
no longer serves you well.

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to find
out why are you still holding

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.929 align:middle line:90%
onto it?

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you think
about something, what

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
are you holding onto still
that you really want to let go?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.602 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Bad habits.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.268 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So one lady said
here, "bad habits."

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:90%
So would you mind standing up?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll get a microphone to you.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what is your
name please, sweetheart?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.173 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Amy.

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your name is Amy.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Amy.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.731 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you
said it's hard for you

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:90%
to let go of old habits.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Can we be more specific?

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:90%
What old habits?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All sorts of things.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.952 align:middle line:90%
Thinking-- thinking habits.

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Thinking habits.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Stop right there.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.565 align:middle line:84%
So it's everything that you say,
as far as what you're saying,

00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
it's going to help
the people watching,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.481 align:middle line:90%
everybody here in the audience.

00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So number one, how
many people here

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
have problems with
thinking too much?

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:90%
At home as well.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Thinking too much.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Overthinking in your head
to try to rationalize,

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.222 align:middle line:90%
try to control things.

00:03:21.222 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Trying to
make things happen.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.721 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Trying
to make things happen.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:25.241 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in your head
trying to make things happen

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.073 align:middle line:84%
all the time, because
you're thinking,

00:03:29.073 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and you have a thought
that I think about it,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.269 align:middle line:84%
the more I think about it,
the more it's going to happen.

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Not really, because
you'll get in your way.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.186 align:middle line:90%
You'll overthink something.

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:39.518 align:middle line:84%
And that happens all the time
with spirit communication,

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
too, when I have audiences
come to the studio,

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and they think, if I'm just
thinking of a loved one,

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
if I think more about them,
they're going to be here.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Just the opposite.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.300 align:middle line:90%
It pushes them away.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
overthinking things,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
we're giving it not the energy
it needs to really manifest,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Where you want to bring
that energy for anything

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
in your life that you want
to really-- is release that

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.687 align:middle line:84%
stuff in the head and bring
the truth into your heart, OK?

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And send it out with
your heart and then you

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.796 align:middle line:90%
send it to the universe.

00:04:06.796 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:90%
And it will manifest.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.402 align:middle line:90%
So old habits.

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
One more thing when
you're thinking

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
about-- thinking, thinking,
thinking-- a lot of people

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in meditation have problems
with overthinking, right?

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Lot of us overthink things.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I have found that if you
have a thought in your head,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
you just acknowledge
that thought, acknowledge

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.465 align:middle line:84%
it's there, and you
let go of judgment.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
You release it.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, I understand I
had this thought.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you release it and
let it go to the universe.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you need to go take a
breath after that, let it go.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And let the universe
take care of it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.706 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's also
a control thing.

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:41.159 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I have
something to tell you.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.060 align:middle line:90%
You have no control.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.115 align:middle line:90%
You have no control.

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:90%
In a way you do, though.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot control
that mind chatter.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.720 align:middle line:84%
You can control how
you respond to it.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, if you
just really breathe into it

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.422 align:middle line:84%
and release it
knowing, OK, I see it.

00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:04.130 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And take away the judgment.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Takes away the critical
mind, and fitting it

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
into judgment of it's got
to be this way-- yes, no.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:90%
Let it go with the way it is.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Neutralize it.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Just try to neutralize it.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you neutralize it, and it
gives more power for it to go.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So what other bad habits you're
talking about besides thinking.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.915 align:middle line:84%
What other things come
up that you were still

00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
holding onto that's not
serving your highest good?

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.106 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My vices.

00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:27.146 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your vices.

00:05:27.146 --> 00:05:28.020 align:middle line:90%
What are your vices?

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Curiously.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Curiously, he asked!

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.142 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:32.142 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Look at her face!

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:90%
It's turning red!

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm psychic.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.341 align:middle line:90%
I know them anyways.

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.744 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Drinking
and smoking weed.

00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I would like to let
go of both of those.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.243 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there's
a judgment on that.

00:05:45.243 --> 00:05:47.361 align:middle line:90%
And why are you judging that?

00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:48.735 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
I feel like--

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's society?

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that background--

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
partially society.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
It's also that I
feel it's holding me

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
in a space of not being
able to transform in the way

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.042 align:middle line:90%
that I want to as a person.

00:05:59.042 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.249 align:middle line:90%
Well great.

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
You're being very
honest; it's fabulous,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:90%
and I appreciate that.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.716 align:middle line:84%
And I think, number
one, you got to stop

00:06:04.716 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
being so hard on yourself.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Stop being so difficult.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
have addictions or vices?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.894 align:middle line:84%
I know, outside people
watching this, you all do.

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
This three-dimensional world
is the addictive world.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we as
souls come back here,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.504 align:middle line:84%
and many of the main lessons
we work on are addictions.

00:06:20.504 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Because we work through
these addictions

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%
of physical vibration.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.491 align:middle line:84%
We got to be very, very
careful that everything in life

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
really needs to be, if you
will, everything in life

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
needs to be in moderation.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem with
smoking weed and drinking

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
and, hey, I'm good with
that-- if it's in moderation.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes
when we take something

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and we abuse it, or
overuse it, we're

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.700 align:middle line:90%
not-- then we don't focus.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's with you.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's OK every once
in a while to enjoy something

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:84%
like that, whether
it's riding a bike,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
going hiking, smoking weed,
having a drink, singing a song,

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.480 align:middle line:90%
taking a day off of work.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:90%
As long as it's in moderation.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we need that.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we need that
because we need to rest.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
If we're constantly
go go go go go

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
go go go-- it's not
going to work for us.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
If we can just take a moment
of stopping, and sometimes

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.805 align:middle line:84%
it forces us to stop, and
we want to lose ourselves.

00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're thinking,
over-thinking so much like you

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
are in your head, I'm thinking,
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:90%
You need to stop that.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you have to
stop that by letting go,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.455 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the body, in your
mind, whether that's drinking

00:07:29.455 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, smoking
weed, putting yourself

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
in a different state
of consciousness.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing yourself to a
different state of conscious

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.795 align:middle line:84%
so you can get away
from all that thinking.

00:07:35.795 --> 00:07:36.762 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that is.

00:07:36.762 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's exactly
what it does for me.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's exactly
what it does for you.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's fine.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's release, if
we could, and let's

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
say not necessarily release,
but looking at it differently,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as far as the perspective of
it of why you're doing that,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and you continue to do it,
but moderation is fine.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And maybe just work
on over-thinking.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
feeding the addiction.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:90%
That's feeding that behavior.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So just start looking
at it that way.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:03.909 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:04.825 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a mirror to you.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm really just a
mirror reflecting

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.539 align:middle line:90%
what you already know.

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm just-- you know this.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:90%
So good, very good.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
All the way in the
back of the room.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.797 align:middle line:90%
This gentleman right here.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Would you might standing please?

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And what
is your first name?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My
parent's name is Sasha.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.327 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
let's call you Sasha.

00:08:23.327 --> 00:08:23.864 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's OK.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we can.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.495 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
what came up for you?

00:08:26.495 --> 00:08:28.161 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But it
comes with the themes

00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:84%
of what I thought about,
which is identity.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:90%
What is identity?

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.359 align:middle line:84%
And how is it impinge
on possibility?

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well that's
a whole different show.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, you said letting go.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.701 align:middle line:84%
So let's let go, what I thought
of is letting go of identity.

00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.117 align:middle line:84%
So what's holding you
back from identity?

00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Do I-- do I identify with
what your parents gave you,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
what they thought
of who you are?

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Are you not what
they think you are?

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
What's holding you
back as far as--

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, I would say
it's just-- it's a lot of,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's your name,
it's when you were born.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
This is who you are,
where you're from.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.445 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of
information I don't need.

00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
it's not who you are.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.903 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:90%
At the core.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So that's what I
would say is my life's work.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I'm
going to call you

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, because you look
like Matthew McConaughey.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's seemed fine.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.296 align:middle line:84%
See, I was going to
ask you to name me.

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:90%
You name me.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Matthew.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Matthew.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So today,
right now, I'm Matthew.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
think it's great.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.803 align:middle line:84%
I think it's great
what you're saying.

00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:23.334 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
you're saying is--

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people in
this audience are sharing that.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.708 align:middle line:84%
How many people tend to
live-- in this audience

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
right here, how many people tend
to live the lives that people

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:84%
expect of them, what
you're supposed to be,

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that your parents thought
you were going to be,

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.100 align:middle line:84%
living up to their
expectations, trying

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.599 align:middle line:84%
to live up to
people's expectations?

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.126 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people.

00:09:40.126 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people out there.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And most-- only because
this is Boulder,

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:84%
so there's people a little
more aware of things,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.675 align:middle line:90%
I think, in Colorado, obviously.

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's a great, great point
that you bring, Matthew.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a great point
that you bring up.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
share this with you,

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
because of the work that
I do with the spirit

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
world, many times they'll
come back and they'll say,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
you're not what
people think you are.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You're not, you know,
the job that they

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:90%
want you to be success.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:90%
You have to have money.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to do this to
please other people.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
If I do this and get married,
that's what they expect of me,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
honor me and love me.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's a trap.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.069 align:middle line:90%
That's an illusion.

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remember that in
this three-dimensional world,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:90%
it is the world of the illusion.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not the truth here.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:90%
This is not true.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:90%
This is not real.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.749 align:middle line:84%
This is really just our stage,
literally and figuratively,

00:10:26.749 --> 00:10:28.915 align:middle line:84%
this three-dimensional world
is really just a stage.

00:10:28.915 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't get caught
up in the illusion.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you get caught up in
the illusion of other people,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of what they expect of you, and
you fall into that trap of what

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
they expect of me, then
you fall into the illusion.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're not living
your authentic.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Totally true.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Totally true.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I totally feel
what you're saying.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.955 align:middle line:90%
And it's your genuine self.

00:10:47.955 --> 00:10:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think with you
it's just a matter

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
of letting go of those
old ways of thinking.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The old ways are patterns
that people placed upon you,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.005 align:middle line:90%
and that you gave energy to.

00:10:57.005 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: For sure.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.454 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:10:58.454 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like
a lot of us do.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.911 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us give life to
what other people think,

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.554 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
be accepted by them.

00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:90%
We want to be loved by them.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And we often think that
if we just do this,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
what they expect of us,
then they'll love us.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So it's
all about love, right?

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
all about love.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:90%
But you have to love yourself.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have to honor
yourself enough not

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.730 align:middle line:84%
to live in other
people's illusions.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:90%
So fabulous.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:90%
We'll work with you today.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.188 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you've stood up.

00:11:20.188 --> 00:11:22.339 align:middle line:84%
And you-- just by you
standing up, Matthew,

00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:84%
you may have helped many, many
people that are watching this.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my friend.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:26.558 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:11:26.558 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.622 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we have a lady right here.

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:29.121 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You have one.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.655 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Libby.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi,
Libby, how are you?

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Could I just hug you?

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I think I
just want to hug you.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.582 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Whoops!

00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:35.082 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:11:35.082 --> 00:11:36.788 align:middle line:90%
The biggest day.

00:11:36.788 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I beg your pardon?

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not that type
of show, Libby!

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.069 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what
came into your mind.

00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
one of the things

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that I really struggle
with is feeling

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
everybody else's stuff.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Happiness, for sure.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And it has given me an ulcer.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have to remind
myself, I can't

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
control-- there's
that word-- control.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But I can't control
everybody else's lives.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:90%
And I try.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And they probably
don't like me for it.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.105 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't that great?

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:17.967 align:middle line:84%
Who cares what
other people think?

00:12:17.967 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:84%
What other people think of
you is none of your business.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.997 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to be in
that space of receptivity

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and realization and
self-empowerment,

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:90%
in the sense that I am who I am.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.927 align:middle line:84%
I'm a beautiful, light
being, a light soul,

00:12:31.927 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
coming back on this planet
to bring light and illuminate

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
To every single person
who comes upon my path,

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to enlighten them.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.186 align:middle line:84%
If they receive that
enlightenment, fine.

00:12:41.186 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:90%
If they don't, that's fine.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:90%
That's their trip.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:90%
That's their story, not mine.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.374 align:middle line:84%
I can't force people
to be enlightened.

00:12:47.374 --> 00:12:49.165 align:middle line:84%
I cannot force people
to see the way I see.

00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I cannot force people
to understand the way I

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's not why I'm here.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going to live in that
illusionary world of falling

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:90%
into that, I'll never be happy.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're not right now,
because so far you've

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:84%
lived your whole life
up to this point.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I got to
take care of people.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a caretaker.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.430 align:middle line:90%
I see my role as a caretaker.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
My character in this time around
in this play is the caretaker.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now I know I hugged you,
because so many of us

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
fall into that character,
that role of caretaker.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.236 align:middle line:84%
I have to take care of that
person to help heal them.

00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I have to take care that person
to make them feel better.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I gotta do that because
of just who I am.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:90%
To a point.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But you can't forget about
taking care of yourself first.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:84%
What good are you
to other people

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
if you can't take care
of yourself first?

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you say
ulcer, I know that.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.670 align:middle line:84%
I had an ulcer once, years
ago before I worked on myself.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Years ago before I
felt, you know what?

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I have to honor myself.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
I have to honor myself.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about the ego self.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a very different thing.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Honoring my soul.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Honoring my purpose.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Honoring who I am as
a spiritual being.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And you know, look
at me as an example.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.442 align:middle line:90%
I did this work for 30 years.

00:13:55.442 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I talk to dead
people for a living.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.604 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:13:57.604 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I first
started doing this,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:90%
nobody was out there.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's a tough thing.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a lonely road
sometimes, right?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.220 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
be true yourself.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The more-- the truer
you are to yourself,

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
the more freedom you
have in your life.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.747 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to be
anything-- anyone but yourself.

00:14:13.747 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to help you
to release all that old stuff

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.915 align:middle line:84%
which you think of who you
are instead of who you are.

00:14:19.915 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us think who we are
instead of who we truly are.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Our genuine self, right?

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And other people's
influences in our lives.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetie.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Can I hug you again
one more time?

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:90%
You're a sweetheart.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to say,
everybody respects you,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
as far as the worlds
around us, the realms

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.001 align:middle line:84%
around us, the spirit
realms, for who you are.

00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And they just want you
to take care of yourself.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:90%
And that'll be good.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Alkaline diet.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:90%
How about one more?

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
One more of the
stuff that came up.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.981 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
Alanis Morissette, who's

00:14:52.981 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
sitting next
Matthew McConaughey.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've never
gotten that before.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.325 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what is your name?

00:14:57.325 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kelly.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kelly,
would you mind standing?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Hi, sweetheart.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:90%
What came up for you in that?

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Letting go of
old patterns with my husband.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are you
currently married?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.965 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Were you
married once before?

00:15:06.965 --> 00:15:07.357 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:15:07.357 --> 00:15:08.065 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:15:08.065 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So can you share with us
what patterns those are?

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's a
pattern of things

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that's happened to
my insecurities,

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:90%
and certainly his insecurities.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:19.725 align:middle line:90%
And they come.

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:20.266 align:middle line:90%
They unfold--

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:21.682 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like
what, insecure?

00:15:21.682 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
I am a pleaser,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.564 align:middle line:84%
and I need to make sure
everyone's happy all the time.

00:15:26.564 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Pleaser.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And he has insecur--

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And why do
you think it's important

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.892 align:middle line:84%
that you have to make him feel--
why do you have to please?

00:15:32.892 --> 00:15:33.975 align:middle line:90%
Why do you have to please?

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
I need to make

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
sure everyone's happy
around me all the time.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Why?

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
think honestly it's

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.517 align:middle line:84%
an old pattern that
started way before me.

00:15:39.517 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
It feels like something
that started--

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Past lives?

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A generation.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.506 align:middle line:90%
Maybe past lives as well.

00:15:43.506 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
can be generational.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Those things pass
into generations.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel
like it's something

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that passed from my
parents for sure.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm playing out
a pattern that they had.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And uncannily, it's happened
now with me and my husband, who

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
seems nothing like my
father who passed away.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And my husband seems
nothing like my father.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I hope not.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I hope you didn't
marry your father.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't think I did.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.365 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's,
like, another whole thing.

00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I didn't set
out to do that at all,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and yet it's the
exact same pattern

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.471 align:middle line:84%
that I had watched in my
parents, unfolds with us.

00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:11.221 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We tend to sometimes
repeat patterns

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of behavior with parents.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
That we tend to
live in those roles

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:90%
that we were taught as kids.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.516 align:middle line:84%
And we sometimes associate love,
and that's how we receive love.

00:16:20.516 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Can I just share
with you, Kelly,

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:90%
something very important?

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.525 align:middle line:84%
A realization which
I think you know.

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:27.466 align:middle line:90%
But today's a brand new day.

00:16:27.466 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Yesterday was yesterday.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Today's a brand new day.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And tomorrow's future
is all different.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So you have the power right
now to release old patterns.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And the first way
of doing that is

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.027 align:middle line:84%
having them come to the
surface and acknowledging them.

00:16:43.027 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So for all of us
here in the audience,

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:84%
it's acknowledging old
patterns of behavior,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:84%
old ways of thinking, other
people's energy in our space.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Don't need it.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
If it's not serving your
highest good, you can let it go.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:90%
You can let it go.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll
feel a lot better,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:90%
because I think they entrap us.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
They entrap our soul,
they entrap our spirit,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and I would just like you
to-- so today we'll do that.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.938 align:middle line:84%
You're acknowledging that, and
we're going let that one go,

00:17:06.938 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.709 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Very good, everybody.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.925 align:middle line:84%
Give yourselves a round
of applause for that.

00:17:11.925 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.183 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do is I'd like

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
to bring you through
a process right now.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And the process is like a
meditation, or a mind journey.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.202 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
work that I've been

00:17:25.202 --> 00:17:26.819 align:middle line:84%
doing for many,
many years, which

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
has helped so many
people to look

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
at themselves in
a different light

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and to really connect with their
true essence of themselves.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.963 align:middle line:84%
So it's just going to be a
little bit of a mind journey.

00:17:35.963 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:90%
And just go with me with it.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And I think you'll enjoy.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:39.641 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So just close your eyes
and sit back in your chair.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.624 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
some music playing,

00:17:43.624 --> 00:17:45.426 align:middle line:90%
and I'll guide you through this.

00:17:45.426 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So just sit with your feet on
the floor if you could please.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to close your eyes.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.766 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:17:54.766 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Everyone at home,
just close your eyes.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Get into a safe-- nice
space, comfortable space

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:90%
where you won't be interrupted.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Just take a deep
breath, and exhale.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And as we enter into
this space of healing,

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
into this space of connectivity,
into this space of awareness,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.210 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
that in the mind.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:90%
The mind is a spirit.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:90%
The mind is our soul.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to let our
soul take over and connect, be

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:90%
with us, integrate with us.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So in your mind,
I'd like you to be

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.920 align:middle line:84%
just aware, mindful
of your physical body

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.762 align:middle line:90%
sitting in the chair.

00:18:37.762 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful of the sound of
my voice, the music behind it.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
be mindful yet again, now

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
the energy of your feet on the
floor, your legs, your backs

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
on the chairs, your
shoulders and your arms,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
chest back, your
neck and your head.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful of the body itself.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:90%
The inside of the body.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Muscles and organs
and tissues and cells.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you become mindful,
along with that mindfulness,

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:84%
bring a sense of gratitude--
gratitude to the physical body,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
for the heart that pumps
that blood to feed the body.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Appreciation to the body
for getting you from one

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
place to another.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:90%
Connect with your heart.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The heart, the seat of the soul,
is really where we come from.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:90%
That's our source.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is just an observation.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.130 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Just for you to observe.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:90%
There's no judgment here.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's just as if you're
observing something,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:90%
like you're reading a book.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to be aware
of a beautiful light that

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
comes from the heaven
and shines down upon you.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world
has come together.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They've all come together
to form this light

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to share with you right
now at this moment.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a unique light for
who you are as a soul.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And they just want to bring
that light into your awareness.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Into the entire
beingness of who you are.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.972 align:middle line:90%
To reconnect with that light.

00:20:20.972 --> 00:20:22.805 align:middle line:84%
So together we're going
to fill up our heart

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:84%
with that beautiful
light of the spirit.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Whatever color, shape,
feeling you have is just fine.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So together, let's inhale
that beautiful light,

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:90%
and inhale through the nose.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Letting it go.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Letting it go.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Letting it go.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:90%
And one more time.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit there now, in
your imagination, in your mind,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I would like for you
to envision yourself

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful park, a beautiful
field of green, green grass,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.785 align:middle line:84%
flowers and trees of any design
you create in your imagination.

00:21:11.785 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And as you're walking
into that park,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:84%
you are pulling
behind you a wagon,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
like a little red wagon
we had as children,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:84%
just carrying that wagon
into the center of that park.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
carrying that wagon

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to the center of
that park, we notice

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:84%
there's a lovely hot air balloon
in the center of that park,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
beautifully ornate,
purples and reds.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:90%
That balloon is so pretty.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And we notice as we look at
that balloon, the colors,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
the design fits
us just perfectly.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It's as if that is
part of our soul.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
That's part of our character,
our description that's there.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So just acknowledge that that
hot air balloon is part of us.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And now I just want you to
imagine that you're pulling up

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that wagon to that
hot air balloon.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.876 align:middle line:84%
And that wagon is
filled with boxes.

00:22:15.876 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Boxes.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And each box has a label which
represents old belief systems.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:90%
One box says, "I give too much."

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Caretaker.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Over-giving.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Take that box and put it into
the basket of the hot air

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:90%
balloon.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Judgment might be another one.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Take that.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Put it in the balloon.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Any old patterns.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Behavioral patterns.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Loving too much.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Not loving enough.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.064 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you get in the
box that has a label.

00:22:52.064 --> 00:22:53.480 align:middle line:84%
You might pull out
of the box that

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.120 align:middle line:84%
has a label you
never even expected.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe guilt.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
There might be one
saying "resentment."

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
There might be one
saying "self-criticism."

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one, "other
people's lives."

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
There might be one for
someone that's passed over,

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
and their name is on there.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
These boxes contain
things-- energy

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that you are holding
onto that are not

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:90%
serving your highest good.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is not
serving your highest

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
good of your soul, that is not
in alignment with your purpose

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:84%
for being here at this
moment in time and space

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
on this earth
school, we're going

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:84%
to put that in the
bottom of that basket.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Time to let it go.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Time to release old behaviors.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Time to release old resentments.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Time to release old friends,
family members, those people

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:84%
in our lives who
are holding us back

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
from being truthful
to ourselves.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Who in your life
is holding you back

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.752 align:middle line:90%
from your pure light of being?

00:24:11.752 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
You no longer need
to take care of them.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
They need to take
care of themselves.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm releasing myself, old
friends, old relationships,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
old situations that are not
serving my highest good.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm releasing them now, too,
putting them in that basket.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.152 align:middle line:90%
So look in that basket.

00:24:31.152 --> 00:24:33.335 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty full now, isn't it?

00:24:33.335 --> 00:24:34.140 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.015 align:middle line:84%
It's all right to just
put it in that basket.

00:24:36.015 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:90%
In that basket.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you empty that
wagon, putting everything

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
that basket, when
the time is ready,

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I want you to untie the ropes
of that hot air balloon.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.530 align:middle line:84%
When you are ready
to release and let

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
go of those old
structures which you

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
think you were, who you
are, who you identify with,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
what you identify with--
it's not who you truly are.

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Those are the illusions that
you try to make who you are.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Untie that rope
and let it fly up.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's go up and up
and up, and honor it

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and celebrate it, because
all of those things,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
all those issues,
all those patterns,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.220 align:middle line:84%
taught you something
about yourself.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Taught you boundaries, gave you
more of an awareness of you.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Let them go now.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Release.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
as we release.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.164 align:middle line:84%
And now exhale, and
release that balloon.

00:25:36.164 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And let it go up in the sky.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Let it go, let it go, let it go.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Watch it.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Watch it ascend up.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Thank them-- gratitude--
for all those lessons,

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:49.980 align:middle line:84%
all those people, all those
issues, all those behaviors no

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:90%
longer serving you.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you release
them, I want you now

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:84%
to look down at your body and
become aware of the new clothes

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:90%
that you're wearing.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
The new, perhaps,
robes, clothes.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:90%
How bright they are.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:90%
How light they are.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
As you look down and become
mindful of you, now, that soul,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:90%
how different do you look?

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.010 align:middle line:90%
How much lighter do you feel?

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:90%
You're yourself again.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Look and see your true
self, your soul self.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:90%
See how bright.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:84%
See the colors you've
never seen before.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The designs and the patterns
that have always been there,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.618 align:middle line:84%
but you never let
yourself see them.

00:26:36.618 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Deep breath, and exhale.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:90%
In that new space.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you look
back at that wagon,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:84%
it is now a gorgeous carriage--
a horse-drawn carriage

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%
that has your name on it.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self--
your true self--

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.470 align:middle line:84%
has been waiting for
you for a long time.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Now climb aboard that carriage
and go live your true life.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.531 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.832 align:middle line:90%
And let it be.

00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Love is the answer.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Love is the strongest
force in this universe.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:84%
As you come back into
the space of this body,

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.875 align:middle line:84%
this physical space here in
this studio, the physical space

00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
of your body if you're watching
this, be mindful of your feet

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:84%
again, your legs, your backs,
your shoulders, your arms,

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
chest, your heart,
shoulders, head.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.345 align:middle line:84%
Bring back that sense
of love of self,

00:27:41.345 --> 00:27:43.499 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful light
from your heart.

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Surround yourself from
the top of your head

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of your feet
with that loving energy.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for some of you, it's a
first time to acknowledge that.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Love by its very nature is
not to keep, but to share.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:59.526 align:middle line:84%
So please send that to the
person on your right side,

00:27:59.526 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and wrap them from
the top of the head,

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.847 align:middle line:90%
the bottom of their feet.

00:28:03.847 --> 00:28:05.430 align:middle line:84%
As we sit together
in this one energy,

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
we ask, Divine heavenly
parent, we ask your blessing

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:90%
on this meeting.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to me.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends,
speak clear to me.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Give us glimpses of eternity.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And let us know
that you are free.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Give us names and
facts and places.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Help us to understand
Heaven's graces.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Send your thoughts upon me
with emotion and simplicity

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.090 align:middle line:84%
as we sit together in
peace, love, harmony,

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and the true essence
of our being.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.831 align:middle line:84%
Slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:28:39.831 --> 00:28:43.171 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.171 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.044 align:middle line:84%
Do you look brighter
and happier.

00:28:45.044 --> 00:28:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Good one, yeah?

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.440 align:middle line:90%
That's really, really good.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have to feel
it right now instantly.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm crying.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:90%
So just be with that.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:90%
You can always use that.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a process for
releasing and letting go.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's good to let go.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:90%
It's so much lighter.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.910 align:middle line:90%
And life happens so much easier.

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:90%
You look better.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.920 align:middle line:84%
More happy with
yourselves, yeah?

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's great.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.060 align:middle line:10%
As I touch the
spirit world for you,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:10%
I become aware now as
I move into the space.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware of a gentleman
that comes to my mind.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that
he has brown hair.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that
in his younger life

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.020 align:middle line:84%
he's a pretty carefree,
go-lucky kind of guy.

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm Robert.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.570 align:middle line:90%
My name is Robert, or Bob.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that
in the lifetime here

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.770 align:middle line:84%
there would have been
a woman left behind,

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and I do feel it might have
been my wife who's still alive,

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:90%
who is still around here.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:90%
And I just got to go with that.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.822 align:middle line:90%
I know that I'm a father figure.

00:29:40.822 --> 00:29:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And I know I need to do that.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So who does that make sense to?

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.570 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense to you.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.361 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing please?

00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:48.749 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.749 --> 00:29:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
start crying right away.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
should be crying

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.436 align:middle line:84%
right away, because
it's very emotional.

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And why do we cry?

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Because it touches our heart.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say--
And your name is?

00:29:59.530 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kelly.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kelly.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say that
this gentleman is coming

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.620 align:middle line:84%
through very, very
strong, and he's

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:05.036 align:middle line:84%
giving me a sense
that someone was

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:06.745 align:middle line:90%
not there when he passes away.

00:30:06.745 --> 00:30:07.494 align:middle line:90%
Was that you?

00:30:07.494 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.993 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:30:08.993 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So I know as he comes through
here, for his healing,

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.620 align:middle line:84%
he needs to let you know
the fact that you need

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to forgive yourself
for not being there.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of things
I hope you let go of.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Because that stuff,
we don't need.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I know that he's
trying to help you

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:84%
more now than he was
able to in the lifetime,

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.580 align:middle line:84%
because geographically he wasn't
there for you in the lifetime.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Understand that?

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't a part of you
physically in the lifetime,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and he wants to
be there now, OK?

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.086 align:middle line:84%
And I need to ask about
some drinking situation.

00:30:36.086 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go about
someone drinking.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.734 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:30:39.734 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't
know if there was someone

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:84%
in the family, and I'm not going
to say it was necessarily Rob--

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.015 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:44.015 --> 00:30:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure it's him.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:90%
But it might be a brother.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.315 align:middle line:90%
Or it might be his--

00:30:48.315 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It
might be his wife,

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
who is my mom, who just
had a conversation with me

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.034 align:middle line:90%
this morning about it.

00:30:54.034 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:55.940 align:middle line:90%
So remember.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.710 align:middle line:84%
When he first comes through,
he mentioned his wife.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.570 align:middle line:84%
He referred to the wife
that was still here.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So let me just go ask
some more about the-- Yes.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, yes,
that's exactly right.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.360 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me also
that she's taking pills.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.736 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:06.736 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
he's concerned about that.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:84%
He's concerned about her
mixing certain things.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.780 align:middle line:84%
He's concerned about her taking
certain percentages of pills

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that she should be taking,
mixing with other things,

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:90%
and taking too much.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:90%
And she's drinking alcohol.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I know she's very
depressed, and I

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:84%
know that he comes close
to her every single day.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that she talks
to her Robbie every day.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I know that she puts her hand
to her mouth all the time.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I know that she really
sits in depression.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.719 align:middle line:84%
I know that in some ways
she feels unfulfilled.

00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:35.134 align:middle line:84%
And I know that in some ways,
she wanted to do more in her

00:31:35.134 --> 00:31:36.165 align:middle line:90%
life, and she didn't.

00:31:36.165 --> 00:31:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.153 align:middle line:84%
I feel from your father,
as he comes through here,

00:31:40.153 --> 00:31:42.492 align:middle line:84%
he tells me that
at one time there

00:31:42.492 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:84%
might have been a thought about
her going into medical work

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:45.730 align:middle line:90%
or being a nurse.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She is a nurse.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She is a nurse.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there has
to be a gift from her,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that certain ability
that her soul has.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very aware
that as she is a nurse now--

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and is she currently still
working as a nurse, then?

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's considering
right now going back into it.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Funny.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I was just
getting in my head,

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:84%
he said there's going to
be a change in the nursing,

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.130 align:middle line:84%
or a change in the career,
or a change in the medical.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:90%
He's a guide of hers.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.040 align:middle line:90%
He loves her very, very much.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:90%
And he said he's really sorry.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:84%
He's really sorry to
have caused her pain.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.140 align:middle line:84%
He's really sorry
that he did not

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:90%
express his love enough to her.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.831 align:middle line:84%
That she would understand
it the way she could.

00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:84%
It's that old pattern we
were talking about, right?

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that it?

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.726 align:middle line:90%
Because now I'm going at it.

00:32:28.726 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.359 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:32.025 align:middle line:84%
And how do we know
this is not a pattern

00:32:32.025 --> 00:32:34.192 align:middle line:84%
from previous incarnations
that has to be lived out?

00:32:34.192 --> 00:32:36.233 align:middle line:84%
But I know from his point
of view and perspective

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit world, he's
coming here very, very strongly

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:90%
to say, I'm sorry.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Please tell her I'm here.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Please tell her I'm here.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.385 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Is he
saying anything

00:32:44.385 --> 00:32:45.810 align:middle line:90%
about her new boyfriend?

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, I'm sure
he'll get there eventually,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.407 align:middle line:90%
let's just say.

00:32:49.407 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he has a
whole list of things

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:90%
he wants to talk about here.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I need to ask you a question
as it comes to my mind.

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
being ill, this man.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Now he's talking to me about
the latter part of his life.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I can't do
anything for myself.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:05.940 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm laid up.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.184 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure, I might--

00:33:08.184 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking
about your mother,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.130 align:middle line:84%
here, taking care of
him, and really being

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.890 align:middle line:90%
the enabler in some ways.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
say something here.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.676 align:middle line:90%
And I come from my heart.

00:33:16.676 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm not judging this.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm just observing it
as he comes through.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.841 align:middle line:84%
And there's a part
of your mom, which

00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is so interesting how
this worked today.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:84%
We talked about giving
so much, and over-giving.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And I know that, I know
that-- go on-- your mother

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:84%
sometimes disables
instead of enables.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:90%
A co-dependency there.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think he fed
right into that.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:39.969 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:33:39.969 --> 00:33:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, she's fallen
into the same pattern

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with this man that's
she with right now.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.185 align:middle line:90%
And it's not great.

00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
she knows, you see.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And she needs to-- if you
can bring this exercise we

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
did about releasing
and letting go to her

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and helping her with that,
I think she's ready for it.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I think she's bought two
new books, he's telling me,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
that she has not read yet.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're self-help books,
they're self-improvement books,

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:90%
but she hasn't even opened them.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:04.275 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you know that.

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:07.051 align:middle line:84%
The guy that's with her, he was
married before, was he, please?

00:34:07.051 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel that relationship
that he was in-- your dad's

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.699 align:middle line:84%
going on about-- was not a
great relationship that he

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:90%
was previously in.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be-- that's some
not great influences with him.

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.837 align:middle line:84%
I want her to start doing
some mirror work, your mother.

00:34:19.837 --> 00:34:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And this coming from
me, not from him.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.461 align:middle line:90%
He's saying help, please.

00:34:22.461 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So mirror work, what I say is
on the mirror in the bathroom,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.090 align:middle line:84%
if she'll do it,
write the words,

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.019 align:middle line:84%
"Healthy am I, happy
am I, holy am I."

00:34:30.019 --> 00:34:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And she says it three
times in the morning,

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:32.870 align:middle line:90%
brushing her teeth.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Three times at night.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.199 align:middle line:84%
And we start using that
vibration, she'll change.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.730 align:middle line:90%
If she wants to change.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:90%
You can't make her change.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:40.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.750 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk also-- go on.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why she got a
hospital bed in that room.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.389 align:middle line:84%
If she brought a
hospital bed in for him.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.630 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:51.429 align:middle line:90%
She did that.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And she redid the room for me.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:90%
She put fresh flowers there.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.644 align:middle line:84%
She kept the TV in
a certain place.

00:34:55.644 --> 00:34:56.810 align:middle line:90%
She would always talk to me.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want to thank
her very much for the soups

00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.550 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.887 align:middle line:90%
She fed him soup, you know that.

00:35:00.887 --> 00:35:02.595 align:middle line:84%
In particular, like
a soup that he liked.

00:35:02.595 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:90%
So would you give her his love?

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.439 align:middle line:84%
I know that her mind is
still with your father,

00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:09.480 align:middle line:84%
even though she's physically
with this other guy.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say, your dad
doesn't care for the other guy.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.596 align:middle line:90%
Got to say that.

00:35:13.596 --> 00:35:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't either.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.385 align:middle line:90%
Good job, Dad.

00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's
a bit of a low life.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.893 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be
judgmental, but it's

00:35:18.893 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:84%
the only way I can
description or characteristic.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I wondered
if he thought so, too.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I'll
leave you with that.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Please watch-- and
Joseph, also, by the way.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.814 align:middle line:90%
Either Joe or Joseph.

00:35:26.814 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:90%
So that means something now.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.438 align:middle line:84%
But ask your mother if there's
a Joseph in the spirit world

00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:90%
that she knew.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.415 align:middle line:84%
Not sure if it's
an uncle of hers,

00:35:32.415 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
but there's a man named
Joseph in the spirit world

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.149 align:middle line:90%
saying hello to her.

00:35:35.149 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:47.106 align:middle line:90%


00:35:47.106 --> 00:35:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want
to come over here.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask somebody,
who did you want to contact?

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Your mom.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Your mom.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And what about you darling?

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Your mother.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I thought so.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
the two of you--

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I feel someone who
you wanted to contact.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm standing right
here, and I'm getting this

00:35:59.170 --> 00:35:59.836 align:middle line:90%
wah-wah-wah-wah!

00:35:59.836 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But I also have another
mother over here.

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to go this lady.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Your mom's passed over.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Your mom?

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So let me just go
one, two, three.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:90%
And I also get a gentleman here.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I get a father figure back here.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.799 align:middle line:84%
Your dad passed-- your
brother has passed over.

00:36:18.799 --> 00:36:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Let me just see what I can get.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Let me see if I can work that.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Let me just see what I can
get here, whoever comes in.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.310 align:middle line:90%
But I want to invite them in.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.934 align:middle line:84%
So I know I have a
mother here for you.

00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:90%
This lady here.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.977 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:36:29.977 --> 00:36:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kathleen.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.378 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kathleen.

00:36:31.378 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So Kathleen, as I connect with
you and your mom, who I know

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:90%
is here, but not by herself.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.240 align:middle line:84%
So I know I have a lot of people
that come in here around you.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you were sitting
here, I was very aware

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.290 align:middle line:84%
of the whole area here of
these beings, people, spirits,

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:84%
just laughing and joking and
having a great sense of humor.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing the
little bit of an Irish jig

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:50.139 align:middle line:90%
here with me, too.

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So I know I'm Irish, a
bit Irish, because I'm

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.865 align:middle line:90%
doing the jig, you see.

00:36:53.865 --> 00:36:55.716 align:middle line:84%
And I know they want
to talk about that.

00:36:55.716 --> 00:36:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I know Margaret
is here, too,

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.130 align:middle line:84%
with a Margaret's
coming in, too.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you understand the name
Margaret from the spirit world

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:00.990 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:01.912 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that you

00:37:01.912 --> 00:37:03.382 align:middle line:90%
would understand about Ireland.

00:37:03.382 --> 00:37:04.590 align:middle line:90%
I know you'd understand that.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people
had come from Ireland

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.227 align:middle line:90%
to this country.

00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.018 align:middle line:84%
And I feel something, I
have a brogue going on.

00:37:10.018 --> 00:37:12.740 align:middle line:84%
See, I know they're
coming through me here.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.955 align:middle line:84%
So let me go through
the names that I get.

00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting,
because I've worked in Ireland.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So they can-- the
spirit world uses that.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:90%
There's a John.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:84%
There is a Michael-- and
I'm going to tell you that,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.000 align:middle line:90%
over in the spirit world.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.910 align:middle line:90%
And there's definitely a Marion.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:90%
All these Irish names.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to
give them to you.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure one is a
grandmother, the Mary person,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.522 align:middle line:84%
who was the Mary that passed
over, then, in spirit?

00:37:30.522 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Could be an aunt.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A
great aunt of yours?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because then
it'd be grandmother's level.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to say-- and
I know your mom's here, too,

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:84%
but I know Dad has also
passed over, isn't that right?

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
for some reason,

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.890 align:middle line:84%
as I tune into your
family members,

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.365 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring the father
in close to you, OK?

00:37:46.365 --> 00:37:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I gotta tell you

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.430 align:middle line:90%
that he's wearing his jacket.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:50.680 align:middle line:90%
He's wearing a very nice suit.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.160 align:middle line:84%
He's very dressed
up for the occasion,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.940 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
always dress up, you see.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted to
dress up for you now.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to tell you
that I'm very proud of you.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
that he wasn't proud

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:84%
that he didn't say that
enough to you in the lifetime.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.885 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know when your father comes

00:38:03.885 --> 00:38:05.960 align:middle line:84%
through to me, he really,
really is, in a way,

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:84%
apologizing that he
wasn't able to let things

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
out and through his
heart for you, OK?

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I know there was someone that
used to work in the war time,

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:84%
or was in the
military at one point.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think it hurt
them or damaged them,

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.990 align:middle line:84%
or something happened
in the military.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That was my father.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That was your dad.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
I come here with him.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know I have the sense of
being in the war or military.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.654 align:middle line:84%
And it really changed
me very much so.

00:38:28.654 --> 00:38:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I believe that.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know physically,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.940 align:middle line:90%
as well, it changed me as well.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Mentally changed me,
physically changed me,

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.420 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally changed me.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said everything
that he lost in that war

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.649 align:middle line:84%
he's gained now through you
and the rest of the family.

00:38:42.649 --> 00:38:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know your dad
wants to come back here

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.980 align:middle line:84%
with two other
brothers of his own.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, probably.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh yes, it does.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know I want to
talk about music here.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.472 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about also
smoking a pipe at one point.

00:38:52.472 --> 00:38:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, absolutely.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I get that very,
very strong with you.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I know music is a big
deal for your dad as well.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I know I've met
up with your mom.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I've met up with your mom.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.501 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know why he's
speaking like this to me,

00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:90%
but he is.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.410 align:middle line:84%
He was not from Ireland,
but he was from here?

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:07.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was from Canada,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
was from Canada.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:09.665 align:middle line:90%
Which is not Ireland.

00:39:09.665 --> 00:39:09.985 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:09.985 --> 00:39:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But he
speaks so interestingly,

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.340 align:middle line:84%
because the way he's
talking to me is different.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But I got to say, he must
have some Irish heritage,

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:84%
or someone came from
Ireland originally.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.155 align:middle line:90%
Was it part of your family?

00:39:19.155 --> 00:39:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Actually,
that's on my mother's side.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.080 align:middle line:90%
But my father likes accents.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And he was very good at accents.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:29.074 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's
playing with me!

00:39:29.074 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:34.307 align:middle line:84%
He does a very effective
Scandinavian accent as well.

00:39:34.307 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, OK, OK, OK.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:36.915 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:39:36.915 --> 00:39:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
was a strange one.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I know with this
man, and I'm going

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.620 align:middle line:90%
to say he's tight with money.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say he
was tight with money,

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:90%
but he was a little bit.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.020 align:middle line:90%
He knew where every cent went.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
much aware of that.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Now I know there might
have been depression,

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:84%
awareness of the Depression,
and lived during the Depression,

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and I think that influenced
his ways of thinking

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.254 align:middle line:84%
and his values of
money and so forth, OK?

00:39:59.254 --> 00:40:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that he, for
some reason, showing

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.210 align:middle line:90%
me letters in an envelope.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So sending the
letters all the time.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Now I know you must have
received mail from him, posts

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.470 align:middle line:90%
from him at one point.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.731 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I didn't but--

00:40:09.731 --> 00:40:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who did?

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mother did.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.381 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And do you
have those post letters?

00:40:13.381 --> 00:40:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of them, yes.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So he's just bringing that into
my awareness and consciousness.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's very, very
mindful that he's

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.550 align:middle line:84%
talking about you
seeing them recently.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And either you were
looking at them,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.240 align:middle line:84%
or you were aware
that you have them.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:24.945 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:40:24.945 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And weren't you
just recently looking at them?

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:90%
I went through an old box.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I know it was recently,
because he's telling me that.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.827 align:middle line:84%
I could have been
about two weeks ago.

00:40:32.827 --> 00:40:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Approximately.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that your
dad wants me to talk to you.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is right
here, but she's

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.430 align:middle line:84%
letting him speak,
which is fine.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:90%
It's OK for right now.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.074 align:middle line:84%
But he wants to talk about
old trains, something

00:40:42.074 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:90%
to do with the trains.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.320 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to train ride.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.047 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go to
the memory of that.

00:40:46.047 --> 00:40:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, he
used to ride the rails.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:49.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I
have that man here

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.440 align:middle line:90%
with his trains and his rail.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.012 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:40:54.012 --> 00:40:55.220 align:middle line:90%
And I know I love doing that.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I know I love my adventurous
spirit with this man.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:90%
I know that I died.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I tried to live as much life
as I could when I was alive.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I could say this man
lived his life out.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:90%
He didn't waste time.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
He really lived
the most he could.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I know that he liked geography.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:90%
I know that he liked maps.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.150 align:middle line:84%
I know that he--
you understand that?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.025 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes I do.

00:41:11.025 --> 00:41:13.882 align:middle line:84%
We had a big map of the
world on a wall in our house.

00:41:13.882 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfecto.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.385 align:middle line:90%
Perfecto.

00:41:15.385 --> 00:41:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Did you go to your grandparents'
house then all the time?

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A lot, yes.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:19.936 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
did, didn't you?

00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Would you remember a
skeleton key in a door?

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.770 align:middle line:90%
That you used to play with?

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.491 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't that weird?

00:41:25.491 --> 00:41:26.684 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is weird!

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
your grandmother's house.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.336 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:29.336 --> 00:41:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
is very weird.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm around four
years-- you were around four

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.670 align:middle line:84%
years old, five years old, and
they have this skeleton key,

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and she said she was
fascinated with the skeleton

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.210 align:middle line:90%
key in the doorway.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty
bizarre, but that's just

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.760 align:middle line:90%
the way she's giving it.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.468 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, as
you describe it now,

00:41:41.468 --> 00:41:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I actually see the key hole,
and the key I used to practi--

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:46.375 align:middle line:90%
play putting it in.

00:41:46.375 --> 00:41:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All the time.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm just very aware of that.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware of your mother
wanting to say, I'm OK.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
your mother's fine.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.606 align:middle line:90%
You sent her off well.

00:41:56.606 --> 00:41:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know that.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.765 align:middle line:84%
Because you helped
your mother pass over.

00:42:00.765 --> 00:42:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So we need to give
you the honor that you deserve,

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:07.330 align:middle line:90%
because you helped her.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said when other people
wouldn't help me, you did.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It feels like other people
deserted me, and you did not.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm very aware
of that, taking care of her.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And you saw her when she was
ill, didn't you, your mom.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.754 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're standing there
on the left side of the bed.

00:42:22.754 --> 00:42:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
standing on the left side

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of the bed looking at her.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I know you're trying to make
her hair look very, very nice.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:29.110 align:middle line:90%
What hair she had left.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She kept saying,
"Don't touch my hair."

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I'm
very aware that you're

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:84%
standing on the left side of the
bed and working with her hair,

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to make her
look beautiful and pretty.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.716 align:middle line:84%
I know you're giving
her a lot to drink,

00:42:39.716 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:90%
as far as water and fluids.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.100 align:middle line:90%
I know that you do.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I know that there was some
medication she had to take.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.700 align:middle line:90%
You make sure of it.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.283 align:middle line:84%
She's telling me
pills, but she's also

00:42:46.283 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
giving me a little bit
of liquid, just to drink,

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.030 align:middle line:84%
something with drink,
a little medication.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.133 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting isn't it?

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:55.090 align:middle line:84%
She showed me that
really, really clearly.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.042 align:middle line:90%
And I don't like the taste.

00:42:58.042 --> 00:42:58.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very bitter.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Very, very bitter.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
was very outspoken.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
very outspoken.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.060 align:middle line:84%
If she didn't like
you, she tells you.

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:90%
She does, she does.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:90%
She likes that.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't like
that in the house.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.896 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't like what you've
done with that pillows.

00:43:08.896 --> 00:43:10.017 align:middle line:90%
The pillows on the sofa.

00:43:10.017 --> 00:43:12.100 align:middle line:84%
She says you've got some
new pillows on that sofa,

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.891 align:middle line:84%
and you were looking--
you understand that?

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:16.690 align:middle line:90%
And she doesn't like them.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.430 align:middle line:84%
She's very strong
and opinionated.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, she certainly is!

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She definitely is!

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.665 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that there-- she

00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:27.740 align:middle line:84%
has a hard times speaking
at the end of her life.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:90%
This was a hard time.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.380 align:middle line:84%
In a way she wants to really
communicate, but she can't.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.046 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
frustrating for her.

00:43:32.046 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it interesting, in the
lifetime, how what we give out

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:36.847 align:middle line:90%
we get back in some ways?

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way where she
had to learn to listen,

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.440 align:middle line:84%
because in the lifetime
she spoke too much,

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and she had to learn to listen.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.468 align:middle line:84%
And that was one
of her lessons she

00:43:43.468 --> 00:43:45.330 align:middle line:84%
had to continue and
finish and complete

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:46.960 align:middle line:90%
before she passed into spirit.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.044 align:middle line:90%
So lots of love from them.

00:43:48.044 --> 00:43:48.959 align:middle line:90%
I leave you with that.

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:58.382 align:middle line:90%


00:43:58.382 --> 00:44:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to
thank you all very, very much

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.860 align:middle line:90%
for being here today.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to use the
lessons from the spirit world.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I do this
show, it's really

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.614 align:middle line:84%
they're giving me
the information

00:44:07.614 --> 00:44:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to share with you as far as
the lessons, the insights.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.520 align:middle line:90%
And please use that.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.917 align:middle line:84%
And let go of all that that
does not serve your purpose.

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Don't waste the time
you have here on earth.

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very important.

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Very special.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Time is fleeting.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Time here on this earth is
very small-- 70, 80, 90 years

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is nothing in the
scheme of things.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:90%
So make every moment count.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all
very, very much.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.300 align:middle line:90%
And thank you.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And until next time, love and
light to every single one here.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.530 align:middle line:90%
And you.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:37.530 align:middle line:90%
