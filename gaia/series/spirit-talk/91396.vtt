>>ANNOUNCER: And
now, world renowned

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:90%
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hello everyone.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.263 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.263 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also for tuning in
to another wonderful adventure

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of "Spirit Talk," where I take
you one step closer to Heaven.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.614 align:middle line:84%
So today's topic, which
I chose with the spirit,

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
with the help of
the spirit world,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
was to really help
you or assist you

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.978 align:middle line:84%
in understanding where
you go when you die.

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that something
you wanted to know?

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that something
you've thought of before?

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.302 align:middle line:90%
Are you dead?

00:01:04.302 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Wait, I think they're
sending the live ones.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
How many people here,
in their lifetime,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
wondered where you go after
you pass out of the body?

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Everybody, right?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:90%
So everybody has that question.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.761 align:middle line:84%
It's the eternal question
that everybody asks.

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's
very interesting.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we've all been--
obviously, we were born.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And we know a little
bit about life

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.962 align:middle line:84%
before we were born,
the process of birth,

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and what happens
when we're a baby.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.753 align:middle line:90%
We get into this world that way.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:90%
We know that what happens then.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
But we rarely know,
many times, what

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:84%
happens after our spirit
leaves the physical body.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Many people know that
the work that I do

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
is I'm in communication
with the spirit realms

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and the other dimensions
of reality, which there

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
are many, many
realities around us.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Many people think Heaven
or the spirit world

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:90%
is there, above, the clouds.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's depicted
from religions,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:84%
or various traditions,
belief systems.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you
this, rest assured

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit world,
Heaven, is not there,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's all around us, and
within us, and all around us.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting there going.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I do the same thing.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.291 align:middle line:84%
I had the same face
when I found out.

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:90%
I was like--

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.384 align:middle line:90%
But it's really, really true.

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
interesting, because I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
find when I communicate with
the spirit world, of course,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
they're the same as they were
on the Earth in many respects.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
When you first pass over
into the spiritual realms,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
we have the exact same mindset
that we did here on the Earth.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.223 align:middle line:84%
So if there was somebody
who doesn't believe

00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
in this type of work,
spirit communication,

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:84%
even though they left the body
and they're more awake and more

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:84%
alive than they ever
were on the Earth,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and they come to something like
this, spirit communication,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
a demonstration with a medium,
they might stand in the corner

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.381 align:middle line:84%
and say, I'm not
going to do that.

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
try to communicate.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe in
that when I was alive.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.257 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do it now?

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It's happened.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I've had that experience.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It's important that we realize
that when we leave the body,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
it's not something that
happens like, here it is.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We really live spiritually
now at the moment.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Right now as you're
sitting here,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you are really alive
in many levels.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
We're just aware of the
physical three-dimensional self.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to
think of it as--

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and I try to think of it like
this all the time-- wait,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.268 align:middle line:90%
let me just think about this.

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:18.289 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really hard.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Because when you talk
about the spiritual world

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual aesthetics,
it's very, very difficult

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Because in our lives, we've
been really conditioned,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to place
human terms, human laws,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:84%
human characteristics
on another dimension.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.215 align:middle line:84%
So how can you place
certain human traits

00:03:40.215 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
or human characteristics,
even the colors-- colors

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.480 align:middle line:84%
of red, blue, green-- into
a sixth dimension, the seven

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:90%
dimension, eighth dimension.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean the same thing
necessarily in that dimension.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:90%
See what I'm saying?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So really, I think of us in
a three dimensional world

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
here, in this physical
body, is really

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the thumb or the toe of who
we really are as a spirit.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
This is just a small
part of who you are, yes?

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Or even like a tree.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I said
the thumb-- a tree.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is a-- one
part of the tree.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:90%
You go way, way beyond that.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You are much, much more than
just this physical body.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a very small
part of who you are.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It is the densest
part of who you are.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the densest
part of your being.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.389 align:middle line:84%
You are a spirit first
and foremost, or a soul.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call
it a soul, that's

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:84%
fine-- first and foremost,
having a human experience.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.555 align:middle line:84%
You as a soul, being,
move or vibrate,

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
or move at a much
faster rate of speed.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
The energy moves up very
quickly and very fast.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
In this three-dimensional
level, everything

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
is kind of slowed
down quite a bit.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This physical body, everything
is sort of slow and dense,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, oh.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
When you leave this body
at the time of death, which

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
is graduation-- I say graduation
because this is-- it's true.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:84%
This is our
schoolroom down here.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is our
soul's schoolroom-- one

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.072 align:middle line:90%
of many, many schoolrooms.

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:84%
There are many--
as you look around

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
my set, look at all
the schoolrooms.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Look at all these
celestial bodies

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:90%
that are kind of portrayed here.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fabulous, because
there are many star systems.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:90%
There are many solar systems.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The Earth, if you look
at the Earth, in a way,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
it's like a grain of
sand on the beach.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.892 align:middle line:84%
So just imagine the-- really
the immensity, the enormity,

00:05:23.892 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
when you think of the Earth
as just one little piece

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of granule sand compared
to everything there is.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So there's so much
more out there

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.097 align:middle line:84%
than we even are aware of in
this three-dimensional world.

00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
When it's time to
graduate and your soul has

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.305 align:middle line:84%
gone through all
the lessons it's

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
going to do down here on
this Earth level, which

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is one of many
schools, and this Earth

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
affords us physical
things, like-- let's see

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
hurt, emotional hurt,
upset, learning about love,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:84%
learning about fear,
learning about compassion,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
learning about patience,
learning about forgiveness.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
We can do that really well
in the school called Earth.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:84%
When our soul has really
finish graduating,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
learned the lessons it's meant
to learn, the soul goes home.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, that soul can
leave, and graduate,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and learn all of its
lessons in a year,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:90%
if that's what its blueprint is.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Or it can stay around
for 10 years Earth

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:90%
time, 20 years, 85 years.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
physically how long.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:90%
For here it does, the human.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But for the soul,
it doesn't matter,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.071 align:middle line:84%
because the soul is really
based upon experiences.

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It gets its experience, all
the lessons it's learning,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.567 align:middle line:84%
the experiences it goes through
helps the soul to expand.

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're here.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We're here to expand our
awareness, our consciousness,

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.159 align:middle line:90%
who we are.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Another very, very hard lesson
here on this human level

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.745 align:middle line:90%
is grief and loss.

00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of you are here
because of that, I think,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.727 align:middle line:84%
and going through
that physical loss.

00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And we think it's so real.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:90%
It's so real.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.811 align:middle line:90%
It's so real.

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's not, because
there is no loss.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
There is no loss.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:90%
There is no death.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You cannot kill energy.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Energy changes form.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So when we again
apply human conditions

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and human characteristics
on a soul, a spirit,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:90%
it's hard because its energy.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And the one consistency we have
with that spirit side of life--

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the spirit body-- this is the
soul-- and the physical part

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:90%
of you, is love.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And love never dies.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Love just change--
love is always with us.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.014 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit people are
around us more than ever.

00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you graduate, when
the soul leaves the body,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:90%
you go to the spirit world.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit world is made
up of many, many levels--

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:90%
many, many levels.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.865 align:middle line:84%
It's a world within
world within world.

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So think of it
that way-- a world

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.570 align:middle line:90%
within a world within a world.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can experience
those worlds here and now,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:90%
with your mind.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
The mind is part of the soul.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.230 align:middle line:84%
The brain dies a physical death,
but the mind continues on.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.415 align:middle line:84%
So you can sit here right
now, and in a few moments,

00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do
a mind journey.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.985 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring you
on a journey to travel.

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:58.824 align:middle line:84%
You can go anywhere with the
mind, any levels you'd like to.

00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
For most people,
once you pass out

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:90%
of the body, which is painless.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.607 align:middle line:90%
There is no pain when you leave.

00:08:03.607 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:90%
There is no pain when you leave.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.000 align:middle line:84%
It's important that you realize
that when it is your time

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to graduate, no one
graduates alone.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.602 align:middle line:90%
No one leaves the body alone.

00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many beings
around you-- your spirit family

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
and friends come to greet you.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And for them, it's a big party
when you leave this Earth.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
They can't wait for
you to get home again.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
They're so happy.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny because
when we're born,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.160 align:middle line:90%
we cry and everybody's happy.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we leave, they
cry and we're happy.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.638 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:08:30.638 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
Many times you'll find when you
first pass through the spirit

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
world depending upon the
conditions of your graduation--

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a sickness, whether
it's a fast passing, whatever

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.535 align:middle line:84%
it might be-- it seems
that they will bring you

00:08:41.535 --> 00:08:42.951 align:middle line:84%
to what's called
the astral world.

00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The astral world is a replica
of the physical world,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.047 align:middle line:84%
as much as we know in that
there are buildings over there.

00:08:49.047 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
There are beautiful
houses over there.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
There are beautiful parks
and lawns and greens

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and flowers and trees and lakes
and boats on lakes-- everything

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
we have here physically, but
then more so-- more color.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.846 align:middle line:90%
It seems more alive than here.

00:09:03.846 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
that spirit would often

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
say to me, when I first came
here to the astral level, which

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is right above the
Earth level, it

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:90%
seemed so much like the Earth.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But it seems as if I
took my sunglasses off,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and now I can see clearly.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:90%
And I feel at home.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So in that astral world, it's
a reproduction, if you will,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:90%
of everything here.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that they
will bring you there.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
We go there first to adapt--
to adapt in some ways

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to our new conditions
of life in that we're

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:90%
no longer a physical body.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And the mind has to realize.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a transition
period of the mind realizing,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.954 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm no longer in that body.

00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
the movie "Ghost?"

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.154 align:middle line:84%
Remember when Patrick
Swayze passed over

00:09:46.154 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
and he's trying to get back
to his girlfriend there?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And he kept on walking
through things.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't be
seen physically,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
because he's not
on that vibration.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.905 align:middle line:84%
He's not on that
level of energy.

00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:57.279 align:middle line:84%
He's on a higher
level of energy,

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and the physical people, the
humans, couldn't see him.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:90%
But he was right there.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
spirits on the astral world

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:84%
have the lighter
side of themselves.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
The astral world, there
they've an adaption

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
to the new vibration
of where they are.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Many times, it's so
interesting, they

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
will tend to replicate
with their mind,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%
with their thoughts.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They will create this
world, this situation,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
this scenario for you
when you first pass over

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel very,
very comfortable.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And all your friends
and family members,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.781 align:middle line:84%
people you've seen
for-- haven't seen

00:10:28.781 --> 00:10:33.769 align:middle line:84%
for a long, long time in
this life or in other lives--

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
there might be some
souls that you've

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.018 align:middle line:84%
shared past lives with
who you don't know

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
from this incarnation,
but past incarnations.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, yeah.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't limit the soul.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.886 align:middle line:84%
So, many times I find, depending
again on the transition,

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit people
will, with their mind,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:84%
they can create, they can
materialize and replicate

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
a certain scenario,
a certain situation.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.255 align:middle line:84%
So many times, they will
replicate the mother's house.

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.676 align:middle line:90%
The mother's house.

00:10:57.676 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So the soul will feel
very comfortable.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And there will be
the exact furniture.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.384 align:middle line:90%
There's the teacups.

00:11:02.384 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:90%
There's the paintings.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Say wow, this looks like
my mother's old house.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And why do they do that?

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they do
that to help the soul

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
to adapt, to realize
that it's OK.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You passed out of the body,
but it's all very, very real.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Many times it
seems like a dream.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit will often
say, am I in a dream?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Where am I?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:90%
You're my sister.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't seen you for
years because you're dead.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But if I can see you and you're
dead, then I must be dead,

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And they go through
this whole thing,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.503 align:middle line:90%
and it feels like a dream.

00:11:32.503 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:90%
But it's very, very real.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So they might have to
say to that spirit,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.160 align:middle line:90%
well, you know what?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.257 align:middle line:90%
You have passed away.

00:11:38.257 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I know you don't see you
have or feel that you have,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
but let's go to your funeral.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And they will bring them to
their funeral and memorial

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:90%
service if they have one.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll bring them around the
family who's crying and upset.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit will say,
why are they crying?

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:51.969 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:11:51.969 --> 00:11:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dead.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell them I'm not dead.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm very alive.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Yet they can't,
because the human

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:84%
is limited in their perception--
in their perception.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So the human being, if you look
at it in a scale of perception,

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
they have a very limited
scale of perception,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
like a radio band,
the width like that,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
where the spirit
is much, much more.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you develop your intuition
and your mediumistic abilities

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
to a point that--
everybody can to a point--

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to be more aware
of that bandwidth, the wider

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:90%
bandwidth.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So after the astral world when
the spirit adapts and they

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
realize what's going on, that
they are in this new spirit

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
form, many times they'll
go to next level, which

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.380 align:middle line:84%
is the mental level,
which is the mental realm.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, there
are many, many levels

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
and many, many layers.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible it says, my Father
has a house with many mansions.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
What I believe is they're all
different levels which exist.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And we go to these
levels based upon how

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
we lived our life--
the thoughts,

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the energy we gave out,
the words we shared

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.294 align:middle line:84%
with other people, how we
influenced other people's

00:12:51.294 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where we're
going to end up.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be our
Heaven or our hell.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
If you lived the good life, you
tried to the best you could,

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
you tried to demonstrate
compassion wherever possible,

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
you don't take things
so personally in human,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and you did the best you could,
you'll be in a fine place.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you went out of your way
trying to get down on people,

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
hurt people, hate people,
destroy people, manipulate

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:84%
people, you're going to end
up in a space just like that.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So it really is what you do with
your thoughts and your energy

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
you put forth.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So the next world besides the
astral world that we go to

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:90%
is the mental world.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And in this mental world,
we all have a life review.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And we look back and we
relive, in our heads,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
in a mental body, mental
selves all of the things

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:84%
we said to each other-- the
positive, the negatives,

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:84%
We relive it and we feel it
10 times, 20 times, 30 times

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.970 align:middle line:84%
stronger than we did
originally here in the Earth.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.385 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes when
you're not in a great mood

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and you get really upset,
you yell at somebody.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.687 align:middle line:84%
And did you ever
realize that you

00:13:52.687 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
might change the
energy of that person

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.854 align:middle line:90%
and that gets them very upset.

00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And then they go somewhere
else and they yell at somebody,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not in a good mood.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And then that person
yells at somebody

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not in a good mood.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You know about that, right?

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine when you
go to the mental world

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have to relive what
you said to that person

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and how they felt, and
how the next person felt,

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.676 align:middle line:84%
and the next person felt,
so forth, and so on.

00:14:13.676 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And that you're
the source of it.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:90%
That you created that feeling.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
You create that mental anxiety.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:90%
The spirit world is timeless.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.834 align:middle line:84%
There is no time, so
you're outside of time.

00:14:23.834 --> 00:14:25.333 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing
that you have that

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:26.987 align:middle line:84%
exists there is your
mental thoughts.

00:14:26.987 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So you know on this Earth
sometimes when it's difficult,

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
we say things we're
not very happy about,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.125 align:middle line:90%
and we feel very bad about that.

00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Imagine when you're
in the spirit world

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:90%
where there's no time.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to relive those
thoughts over and over again--

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:90%
how you treated people mentally.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Just something to think about.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Just something to think about.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
The next level is really one
I call the celestial level

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
or the heavenly level, where
you really come back closer

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to the light being
that you are, and it's

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
more of, I guess we could
say, the human levels here,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
the more spiritual,
the more enlightened,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:84%
the more levels of
compassion and love

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.302 align:middle line:84%
and oneness--
connection of oneness.

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:84%
That your light travels
to every single--

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.676 align:middle line:84%
that you're part of
every single person.

00:15:06.676 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
That your light is a part
of every single person.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the celestial
levels, where

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
you realize you can influence
and help to bring up everybody.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Very, very important
that you know that.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.801 align:middle line:84%
So when I talk to spirit
and communicate with spirit,

00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
remember that they
might be on many,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
many different levels that are
with what we as humans cannot

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
to communicate is

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.205 align:middle line:84%
they have to lower themselves
down to the human level.

00:15:29.205 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine
how hard that is?

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how heavy that
might be for them, when they're

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
in a light body,
when they're light,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're really effervescent
and buoyant, like just being

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.413 align:middle line:84%
And they have to come back
down to the human level

00:15:43.413 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and try to communicate.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The analogy I like
really a lot is

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:84%
if you tried to sit down at
the bottom of a pool of eight

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.372 align:middle line:84%
feet of water, it's very
difficult, isn't it?

00:15:53.372 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You can't stay there because
that's not your natural place.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
You need to go up and
get air from the surface.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with the spirit world.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
This is not their
natural space anymore.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:90%
They're not of this vibration.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:90%
It's too slow.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:90%
It's too heavy.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And like, oh, I have
to go back down there.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just very hard
for them sometimes.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:90%
But what brings them here?

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Your love, your
love, and lets you

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
know that you don't need
to have the mind chatter,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
the cluttering of the
mind, the dirt of the mind,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.745 align:middle line:84%
with thinking they're dead, with
thinking that they're alone,

00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:84%
with thinking I should have done
this, shoulda, woulda, coulda.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.182 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
like that anymore.

00:16:28.182 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:90%
They forgive you.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
They see you for who you are
as a soul being, not the human.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they
just go above that

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and realize that they are
spirit, realize that they

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:84%
are light, they
are light beings.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:90%
They're not dark beings.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.410 align:middle line:90%
They're light beings.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Stop living in fear.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Live in love.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
It's your natural substance.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It's what you're made of--
the particles of love.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what gives you--
give to each other.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what sustains life--
the love, not the fear.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
share that with you.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.842 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:17:00.842 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Dr. Michael Newton,
he-- "Destiny of the Souls,"

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:90%
"Journey of the Souls," he--

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:08.547 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Love him.

00:17:08.547 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He talked
about the soul actually

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
being in the form of a sphere
and that it changed colors

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:18.691 align:middle line:84%
as it progressed, the more that
your-- as your soul progresses.

00:17:18.691 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%
You agree?

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I just want to hear your input.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I love Michael Newton.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
And I use a lot of his work
and his research in my work.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
And I find that's exactly.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard to say to
you, it's just this way.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
variations of it.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So I can tell you
my interpretation

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.295 align:middle line:84%
is it's very similar
to his in that I

00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
see the soul as a
diamond, as a light.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more aware we are,
the brighter the colors get.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%
The colors change.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:90%
The expansion happens.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's with the more
knowledge, and the more

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
awareness, and the
more love that we

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.615 align:middle line:84%
use, we expand more,
and more, and more.

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
he's speaking about,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:90%
which is exactly right.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
you're welcome.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to share with you
just a little bit of what's

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:90%
called a mind journey.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
see where you go.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Is that good?

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.125 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, you're alive.

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to be a
very-- a quick little mind

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.674 align:middle line:84%
journey as you become
aware that we share

00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:84%
the space with the spirit world
and they're all around us.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I just want you step
into that world with me.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So just close your eyes and
just listen to my voice,

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and just place your
awareness on your body.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Bring all of your
awareness to your feet.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And realize that you are
part of Mother Earth.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And go down all the way
to the bottom of your feet

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
who you are, everything
that you know of yourself,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
go all the way
down to your feet,

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
all the way down through
to Mother Earth--

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
nurturing, loving, beautiful
Earth energy, Gaia energy.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
feel her give you security,

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:90%
nurturing you.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.315 align:middle line:84%
Let her nurture your soul,
nurture that beautiful energy

00:18:55.315 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:90%
from Gaia.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Bring it up.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Let her nurture every
cell, every organ,

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:90%
every muscle in the body.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.715 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:01.715 --> 00:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go deeper
with that with the breath.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.095 align:middle line:84%
So as you bring in a breath,
inhalate, inhalation,

00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to bring it in
all the way down to your feet

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:90%
to Mother Earth.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And just be there.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.061 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.685 align:middle line:84%
Let it go down to Mother
Earth, connected with her.

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, I would like
for you to connect

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.540 align:middle line:84%
with the celestial
world, the spirit world.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine, if you will,
around is this beautiful light.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that illuminacity
around you is

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.375 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the realms of
the spirit all around you.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you for a
moment to just acknowledge

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:84%
in your heart and in your mind
that you are first and foremost

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
a spirit being-- a being of
light, a beautiful light.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
feel more light come

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:84%
into the awareness of the
physical body with the breath.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So imagine a beautiful light
coming to the top of the head

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and illuminating you
to the truth of who

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
you are-- a beautiful
spirit light.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Bring in that light and hold it
two, three, four, and exhale.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, I
just want you to send out

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.502 align:middle line:84%
a thought to the
spirit world-- send out

00:20:15.502 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
a thought to your loved
ones, who's ever there,

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that I am a vessel of spirit.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I am a spirit and
you are a spirit.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:90%
My mind is open.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:90%
My mind is clear.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends
and family, I

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.815 align:middle line:84%
welcome you into my
atmosphere around me.

00:20:30.815 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I welcome you yet again
to this physical dimension

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
so that you may share your
thoughts, your feelings--

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:84%
that you may, please, have the
opportunity to bring a healing,

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to bring a oneness, to bring
an awareness to myself,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that I may be
expanded in my mind,

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.850 align:middle line:84%
expanded in my heart, being
touched by your light,

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:90%
as your light touches my light.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And I just send out
that thought and just

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
feel what that's like to
have that space in your mind.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Just feel what that's like.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath with that.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the love
of the spirit people

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
as they come close
behind you, next to you.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And feel them in their
beautiful, celestial spirit

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.450 align:middle line:90%
bodies.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
How pure, clean,
clear they feel.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
feel the love for you.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.549 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And take another deep breath.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.042 align:middle line:84%
Oh good, you look much nicer
now, much brighter now.

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a good
time with that?

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Did you enjoy that?

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you get
something you didn't expect?

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.663 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you feel
something you didn't expect?

00:22:00.663 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, good.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, that's just a way
of getting into your true self

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:90%
So I gotta tell you that.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:84%
As I come close here, and I let
that spirit world close to me

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and touch my mind, I have
a feeling of a girl here

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.209 align:middle line:90%
who comes in.

00:22:13.209 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a lady who comes in.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like this girl
would have passed over

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:90%
between 18 to 24 years of age.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel she was not
expecting to pass over,

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
so I feel a sense of
surprise, or a shock, or not

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
aware of what's going to happen.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So I know if I bring
this girl in closer to me

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and I like her energy,
she's coming closer now.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that I want
to talk about this girl.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I got
to honor her to come in.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.751 align:middle line:90%
She's in her 20s now.

00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.083 align:middle line:90%
She's coming closer.

00:22:37.083 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I was
unexpected passing.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.487 align:middle line:90%
I feel it was a sudden passing.

00:22:41.487 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
person in the audience

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:90%
thought about her today.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I know my mother is
still here on the Earth.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know I go and
visit her a lot.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know my mother's
having a really hard time.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm just aware of that.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And I hope this makes
sense to somebody here.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.859 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Are you the mother?

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
May come to you, please?

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what is your name?

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Debra.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Debra, would
you mind standing, please?

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, Debra.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK, honey?

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
So did you understand?

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.776 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
repeat the information

00:23:07.776 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
that she gives me here.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So you'd understand in her
age, roughly around 18 to 20s

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that right--
early 20s, not late?

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She'd be 23
on her next birthday.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:17.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.479 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
because every spirit

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
communicates differently.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.821 align:middle line:84%
And I really got to work with
them to come down to this level

00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:26.494 align:middle line:90%
and stabilize.

00:23:26.494 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And your enthusiasm does
help, but they really

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:84%
got to work with my
energy and my vibration.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to go with that.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.174 align:middle line:90%
And go on, go on, go on.

00:23:34.174 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I know you're having hard
time, she's talking about.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:90%
So I know that.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on, go on.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
You understand about passing
away outside the house?

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Or outside.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Would I be in a street
when I pass away

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
or where would I-- Do
you understand that?

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Was it a car?

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
was hit by a train.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hit by a train.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell me.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Just say yes or no.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that I'm outside.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.975 align:middle line:90%
So there was a train.

00:23:50.975 --> 00:23:53.416 align:middle line:84%
She was hit by a train,
but know it was sudden.

00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I know it was sudden.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I know it wasn't
meant to happen.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I know it was an
accident of some kind.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:90%
And I know that.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.390 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.691 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that I don't

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:90%
want you to be upset about that.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that I don't
want you suing anybody.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I know there was
a legal problem.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know that you either

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go after that, legally
go after the train company

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.919 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it was, or
someone at the station.

00:24:15.919 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And you tried doing that, or
went after that, something

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense, please?

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.709 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, we did.

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Settled?

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's
still going on a little bit,

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.146 align:middle line:90%
but you settled.

00:24:24.146 --> 00:24:25.577 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:24:25.577 --> 00:24:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The impact,
there's no impact.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.076 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:24:28.076 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:90%
She didn't feel anything.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.209 align:middle line:84%
She wants everybody here
to know in the audience

00:24:31.209 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that when that happens,
and people at home here,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.906 align:middle line:84%
that when that happens--
and I tell this

00:24:34.906 --> 00:24:38.050 align:middle line:84%
all the time to people, because
I've done this so many years--

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that there's, if
you will, a shutoff

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:84%
valve or a loss of consciousness
before something like that

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world knows
it's going to happen.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.769 align:middle line:90%
They're very aware of it.

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's some
problem that the person wasn't

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:84%
in control of that train or
something happened that-- I

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
don't know if there
was alcohol, drugs,

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.770 align:middle line:84%
something was
going on with that.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know
what that means.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I know that you want her to
come through in your own way.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I know you're trying to get
her through in your own way

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.077 align:middle line:84%
and only you can understand,
but you can't do that.

00:25:02.077 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if I would say to
you, give me the thought

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that I'm thinking right
now, you couldn't tell me.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with spirit.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:84%
You still think of her as
a little girl, she said.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.730 align:middle line:84%
She said my mother still
back to memories of me

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:84%
as a little girl,
as a young girl.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.580 align:middle line:84%
My mother still goes back
to me on my 11th birthday.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So there was an
11th birthday party,

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.665 align:middle line:84%
at the time she
was 11 years old,

00:25:20.665 --> 00:25:22.166 align:middle line:84%
there was a party,
a birthday party.

00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:24.414 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a birthday
party, because she tells me,

00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:90%
there's a video.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
There's some films, a video
of her when she's young.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:28.784 align:middle line:90%
Do understand that?

00:25:28.784 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
you've been looking at those,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
or you have those
and you can't stop

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.215 align:middle line:84%
looking at them every
once in a while.

00:25:33.215 --> 00:25:33.904 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:25:33.904 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.715 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
she gives me the sense

00:25:35.715 --> 00:25:37.881 align:middle line:84%
that she comes into my mind
that there is projecting

00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:39.754 align:middle line:84%
a thought of a
party, a situation.

00:25:39.754 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
And she's happy.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:90%
And she's smiling.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know that was a
birthday party of some kind.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.366 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a separation
now between dad and you,

00:25:47.366 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:90%
or there's a split.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.231 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And I feel from this girl that
I'm very sorry that happened.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I love my dad.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.211 align:middle line:90%
I love my dad.

00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:90%
She loves her dad.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.876 align:middle line:90%
When were you married?

00:25:57.876 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was 32.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 32 years old.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.181 align:middle line:84%
And how long have
you been separated?

00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We have been
divorced several years.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Several years.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to say thank you for
your friend for coming with you.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you know her?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of her.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.170 align:middle line:84%
You're related to
her, aren't you?

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are you sisters?

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Because she just said thank you.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So she goes from a sister here.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.147 align:middle line:84%
Now I know about the back--
I got it back-- the jewelery.

00:26:21.147 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:90%
So I know about either earrings.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I know a necklace or something.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you're wearing it

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.513 align:middle line:84%
or you thought about
doing that today.

00:26:26.513 --> 00:26:27.244 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:26:27.244 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: These
earrings are from her.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware that you've
kept the newspaper articles.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.776 align:middle line:84%
You've kept the article
about her death,

00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and you still have it out.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
say to you something

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.002 align:middle line:90%
that I say to a lot of parents.

00:26:38.002 --> 00:26:39.501 align:middle line:84%
Losing a child is
one of the hardest

00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:90%
lessons on this human Earth.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.376 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the hardest
ones, but it's also one

00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:84%
that the souls pick out
before they come back

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.666 align:middle line:84%
in the incarnation, because
it is one of the, I would say,

00:26:47.666 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:90%
post graduate work.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a real hard lesson, but
it takes a really evolved soul

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:90%
or souls to go through that.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:54.895 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:26:54.895 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.941 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just
want you to honor her.

00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, she's
very independent.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:01.370 align:middle line:84%
She's a smart acre,
a smart aleck.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:90%
She speaks the truth.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't care what she says.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
She'll say things like oops,
I shouldn't have said that.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when she's
talking about going somewhere

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:90%
when she passes away.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.542 align:middle line:84%
So when that happens, there's
a big fork in the road for her.

00:27:13.542 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:14.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she was either
going to go start a new job

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.560 align:middle line:84%
or going to start something
brand new in her life.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.434 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:27:19.434 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know I want
to go out of state sometimes as

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.915 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to a
different state, or she

00:27:23.915 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:84%
had connections to
another state, correct?

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, very much.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that I also wanted
to go to Europe, by the way.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.841 align:middle line:90%
She's talking about that.

00:27:30.841 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand?

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very, very accurate.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very,
very accurate.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.628 align:middle line:90%
And we try to be.

00:27:35.628 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:90%
We try the best we can.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:90%
We try.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Not always there,
but I try to be.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
But can I just let you
know that she's lived out

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that European connection over
and over again in her head.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.934 align:middle line:90%
I know you have as well.

00:27:46.934 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I know about the
photographs-- I'm

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:84%
very aware of the
photographs looking at Europe

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and over looking at that, living
that over again in your mind.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I know you have memories
of that that we share.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I know that you smell
flowers around the house,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.883 align:middle line:84%
because she does that
with you all the time.

00:27:57.883 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I know that you grow a little
patch of garden for her

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:90%
or something round with her.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.775 align:middle line:90%
I know I smell roses.

00:28:03.775 --> 00:28:05.609 align:middle line:84%
I smell roses, and she's
talking about that.

00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So if I go to your place
where you're living now,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.025 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a condominium is it,
or an apartment of some kind?

00:28:10.025 --> 00:28:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's an apartment.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.158 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I see it.

00:28:12.158 --> 00:28:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very aware
then if I go into two rooms,

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.305 align:middle line:84%
one especially where
you sit with a computer,

00:28:16.305 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that room.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You understand that
room, don't you?

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like your office.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.965 align:middle line:84%
If I go to that room, where
you have things hanging up,

00:28:22.965 --> 00:28:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are things
about her there on that wall.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that, don't you?

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.755 align:middle line:84%
Now if I look at
that wall, I see

00:28:28.755 --> 00:28:31.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a flower, what might
be even a card with the flowers

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
on a card, the
front of the card.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.413 align:middle line:90%
Can you place that for me?

00:28:35.413 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
what she's talking about,

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:90%
with the flowers.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:38.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So I know her
photographs are there.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a card
there with a flower.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
something very--

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I want
to say angels there, too.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.051 align:middle line:84%
The angels are right
there, do you understand?

00:28:49.051 --> 00:28:49.550 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her name is Angel.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Her name is Angel.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.192 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:52.192 --> 00:28:54.237 align:middle line:90%
You have her name there.

00:28:54.237 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
You have her name there on that
wall, right-- her name, Angel,

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.263 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:28:58.263 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Because she gave me--
In my mind, the per-- I

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.170 align:middle line:90%
really received angel.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.296 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know
how to receive that.

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So you know what
it means, great.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know that
you cannot identify with

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.620 align:middle line:84%
your daughter dying in
that, that's who you are.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
You're more than that.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to be more aware
of yourself, your own growth,

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and your own grounding, because
you get in your head too much.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.125 align:middle line:90%
You get in your head too much.

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you
take care of her, right?

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Because I like that.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.740 align:middle line:90%
She's around you a lot.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.448 align:middle line:84%
And she's, when you
talk about the stars,

00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:90%
she's right there with you.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to leave
you with that, OK.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.765 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, and thank you

00:29:32.765 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:90%
for coming with her today.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.538 align:middle line:90%
Bless you.

00:29:34.538 --> 00:29:35.163 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:29:35.163 --> 00:29:39.859 align:middle line:90%


00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I have a lady here.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I feel like very much
a mother feeling.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going over here.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Your mother passed over, right?

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you know about
that your mother liking to wear

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:84%
very nice dresses sometimes,
being in style or fashion when

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:90%
she's younger.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.850 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Betsy.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Betsy, nice to--
will you stand up, please.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:90%
May I work with you?

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:90%
So I have your mother here.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I definitely feel
it's your mother.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a big family
by the way, as well.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like we
have more of a family

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
life than we do here.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But I gotta tell
you something, I

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.060 align:middle line:84%
feel there's been-- she's
going on about people were not

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:90%
honest here on this Earth level.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.354 align:middle line:84%
There was some
dishonesty in the family.

00:30:07.354 --> 00:30:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: People were not
truthful about certain things

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.258 align:middle line:84%
in the family, the
family dynamic, things

00:30:11.258 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:90%
that happened in the family.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it was the history

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.970 align:middle line:84%
of the family in the
past 20 or 30 years,

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:84%
but there's some people that
are not telling the truth.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.129 align:middle line:84%
She's going about being
ill or being sick.

00:30:21.129 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And toward the end, I'm very,
very sick with this lady.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not myself, because
your mother's vivacious.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.775 align:middle line:90%
She's outgoing.

00:30:25.775 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:90%
She's exuberant.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
a really fun lady.

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd go on a roller
coaster with this lady.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:30.422 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:30:30.422 --> 00:30:32.338 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I have to
describe her that way.

00:30:32.338 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd go on a roller
coaster with this lady.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.260 align:middle line:90%
She loves to laugh.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.410 align:middle line:90%
She loves to have fun.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And she likes to
have a good time.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:90%
She loves Halloween.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.568 align:middle line:90%
Don't ask me why.

00:30:39.568 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:90%
She says, I love Halloween.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she's
telling me in my mind

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:84%
here that you were either
thinking very recently

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.562 align:middle line:84%
of Halloween,
either the other day

00:30:46.562 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:84%
or if you're going
to do something.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Is there a costume
store I'm going by?

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Something about Halloween--
does that make sense?

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, yes.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.768 align:middle line:84%
Because she was right with
you when you decided that.

00:30:54.768 --> 00:30:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wouldn't dress up
as a witch if I were you.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't necessarily
dress up as a witch,

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.690 align:middle line:84%
but I know there must have been
a thought about doing something

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.190 align:middle line:84%
like that or some
fun thing like that.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.996 align:middle line:84%
I know she's all about
beauty, and fun, and make up,

00:31:07.996 --> 00:31:09.696 align:middle line:84%
and big earrings,
this sort of thing.

00:31:09.696 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell
you that she's

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:90%
more-- she's beautiful again.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's important, that
she's beautiful again.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:16.839 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
her skin is very soft.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that she has
very, very soft skin.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And know that I'm holding her.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I know that I'm hugging her.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that you were
holding her near the bed

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and you were hugging her.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:26.742 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:31:26.742 --> 00:31:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Did you help with the pillows
behind her back or something?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Always.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Always,
because I know

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.700 align:middle line:90%
that she's showing me here.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said that you made
it very personal for her.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
You made it very,
very personal for her.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:90%
You changed things around.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are
a couple things they

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.791 align:middle line:84%
said they might be able
to do and help her,

00:31:38.791 --> 00:31:39.916 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't come through.

00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:42.332 align:middle line:84%
She said, they said they could
help her out a certain way,

00:31:42.332 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
or something wasn't
going to happen

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:84%
where we're going to give her
three more months to live.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.538 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't work out.

00:31:46.538 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Tell me.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She had Alzheimer's
and she was displaced right

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.497 align:middle line:90%
before she passed away.

00:31:57.497 --> 00:31:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let me
get more from her here.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.505 align:middle line:84%
Can I just tell you
that even though you

00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:02.752 align:middle line:84%
think she's Alzheimer's,
mental, I got to tell you,

00:32:02.752 --> 00:32:04.210 align:middle line:84%
she's a voracious
person right now.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.310 align:middle line:90%
She has memory.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell you, she
loves to tell stories,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.266 align:middle line:90%
loves tell stories.

00:32:08.266 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:84%
She always liked
to tell stories.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Got to tell you about that.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.414 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
a grandfather there

00:32:12.414 --> 00:32:13.830 align:middle line:90%
of yours over there with her.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very aware of
him parting the hair,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.552 align:middle line:90%
parting the hair in the center.

00:32:18.552 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Parting
his hair in the center.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are a
lot of people over there

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.524 align:middle line:90%
with her waiting for her.

00:32:23.524 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I know when I'm younger,
I'm either in a choir

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.192 align:middle line:90%
or I like to sing.

00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a church thing
that's very important to me

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:90%
when I'm younger.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that I can relate to that.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.052 align:middle line:84%
I can reference that when I'm
a young girl in my family.

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that I do
things differently

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.801 align:middle line:90%
than most of my family members.

00:32:36.801 --> 00:32:39.729 align:middle line:84%
I'm unique and
I'm my own person.

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I know that I leave
the house and I'm

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:90%
much younger than I should have.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So I left the
environment of my family

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.456 align:middle line:84%
when I was either
19, 20 years of age.

00:32:46.456 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And she was her own person.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
it must have gone then,

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.745 align:middle line:84%
she's going on, too,
about being into a city,

00:32:51.745 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:84%
or going from either
rural to a city.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:54.484 align:middle line:90%
And that was her thing.

00:32:54.484 --> 00:32:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Do you get that?

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that I want to do something.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I have to do secretarial
stuff for a little bit.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.630 align:middle line:90%
And I hated it.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.832 align:middle line:90%
And she hated it.

00:33:02.832 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
always used to want

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to tell the story about how
she went to business school.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.455 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Business school?

00:33:07.455 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And she was, yes.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was
secretary back then.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Secretarial school.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And she had to learn typing.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Shorthand, and
she says Gregg shorthand.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
That was interesting,
the name Gregg shorthand.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.651 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she's saying,
I had to learn Gregg shorthand.

00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And she even had a shorthand
pad with the symbols on it,

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.129 align:middle line:90%
Oh I hated that, she said.

00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's also talking
to me now, she said,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I used to have an
RCA television.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.426 align:middle line:90%
Now isn't this interesting?

00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an old-fashioned
television,

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.576 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, with its
brown legs on it.

00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like a console
television that says RCA.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And has
the gold around the-

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember that?

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she's showing
me that very, very clearly

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and very, very proud of that.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She's very proud.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very
proud of that television

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:90%
or having to get that.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.815 align:middle line:84%
I know around 1952, there
would've been a first time

00:33:48.815 --> 00:33:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that she would have experienced
maybe having things of her own,

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.680 align:middle line:84%
or doing things, or
having her own stuff.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
something that you, young lady,

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.270 align:middle line:84%
came in unexpectedly
in some respects.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really?

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.659 align:middle line:90%


00:34:05.659 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was, yes.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.192 align:middle line:90%
I know I was.

00:34:08.192 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:90%
They never admitted it, but--

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.441 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I mean, back
when I was born, she was 39.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, but it's
not what you're thinking.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So when she says unexpectedly,
that might mean the pregnancy,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.130 align:middle line:84%
maybe not expect the
pregnancy, but it's almost

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
like you brought that
"oomph" into her life.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.388 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't expect
that lease on life.

00:34:30.388 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:84%
And you were able to bring
that lease in life with her.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.604 align:middle line:90%
I gotta tell you that.

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Because she's telling
me around the time

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:84%
you were born, that
either a death happens

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:38.810 align:middle line:84%
around the family, right
around the time you were born.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um hum.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:40.989 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because it
seems like one soul goes out,

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:90%
and one soul comes in.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.819 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me, you
really lit up my life.

00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:47.949 align:middle line:84%
You brought power and
energy back to my life.

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:49.569 align:middle line:90%
And she's thanking you for that.

00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a man
that passes over there

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.010 align:middle line:84%
with either an aneurysm to the
head or something in the head,

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.263 align:middle line:90%
very quickly passes.

00:34:55.263 --> 00:34:56.679 align:middle line:84%
So I know it'd be
a family member.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know it would
be in her family line.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure,
a brother of hers.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But it would be someone
who passed quickly

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:90%
with an aneurysm.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, her brother.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.556 align:middle line:84%
Because I get that
she's with him.

00:35:05.556 --> 00:35:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there's
some people who leave

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and she's going back to what
I was talking about earlier.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.693 align:middle line:90%
Some people leave quickly.

00:35:10.693 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a little harder
time leaving the human shell,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're so much more
aware of this human shell.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was
very-- ah, she's funny.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:90%
She has a funny sense of humor.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.570 align:middle line:90%
She has a funny sense of humor.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.830 align:middle line:84%
She said, I used to like to
read the Reader's Digest.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.175 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, she did.

00:35:26.175 --> 00:35:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I used to like
to read the Reader's Digest,

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.252 align:middle line:90%
she says.

00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.130 align:middle line:90%
And she's very proud of that.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And March is very
significant here, too.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if March
would be a birthday,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:90%
but she's giving me March.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Me.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your birthday.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Because she's talking about
March, and then March with you.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.414 align:middle line:90%
And you're not alone anymore.

00:35:39.414 --> 00:35:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And tell everybody
no one's alone,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.990 align:middle line:90%
which I often tell everybody.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And think what?

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:44.160 align:middle line:90%
I got you.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.451 align:middle line:84%
She said tell everyone to
think the best of themselves,

00:35:46.451 --> 00:35:47.790 align:middle line:90%
not the worst of themselves.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
practice that, people.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.080 align:middle line:90%
She's a real teacher.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she really is a teacher.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
really, really is.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
leave with her love.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to thank
you for helping her

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.690 align:middle line:84%
in the two different
places that she

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
lived at the end of her life--
there was either a hospital,

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:84%
then I'm bringing
to a nursing home.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for making that all happen.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I know you did the
paperwork for that.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You made sure the nurse
or the docs were right.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I got to thank you
for taking care of me.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.196 align:middle line:90%
You were my advocate.

00:36:11.196 --> 00:36:12.695 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
thank you for being

00:36:12.695 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:90%
the advocate for her, okay?

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.470 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.511 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:20.557 align:middle line:90%


00:36:20.557 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I want to go
with a man that passes over.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm over here
with this lady.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.630 align:middle line:90%
You lost your husband, yes?

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
mind standing please?

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And your name is?

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kim.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kim.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of the man
here, but I'm also

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.050 align:middle line:84%
but I'm aware also of
another gentleman here.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.200 align:middle line:90%
And it would be a father figure.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure it's your father
passed over or his father.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But I know it was a
father or father-in-law.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Both
of our fathers did.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know one of
them had cancerous condition.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.556 align:middle line:84%
One of them had problems with
the blood or a cancer one place

00:36:42.556 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:90%
and it goes to another place.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband
and his father.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So your husband had the cancer,
but it started in one place

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.020 align:middle line:90%
and goes to the other place.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know I
want to come here with you.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why
you're here, did you just

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.660 align:middle line:90%
meet each other now?

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's my mom.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mom.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:54.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.739 align:middle line:84%
So can you-- Would you
mind standing, too,

00:36:56.739 --> 00:36:58.127 align:middle line:90%
so I have your husband here.

00:36:58.127 --> 00:36:58.752 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:36:58.752 --> 00:37:01.672 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.672 --> 00:37:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.109 align:middle line:84%
So that would be her
father, wouldn't it?

00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
you were married

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to him at one
point, weren't you?

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.661 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:07.661 --> 00:37:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if he comes
through then, darling?

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And your mom's also
passed over, hasn't she?

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
have her right behind you,

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.123 align:middle line:90%
standing right here.

00:37:16.123 --> 00:37:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And she said, listen.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.140 align:middle line:90%
She said to you, listen.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That would be her.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she said that you

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.130 align:middle line:90%
had an old trunk of hers, too.

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.504 align:middle line:84%
There must have
been an old trunk

00:37:22.504 --> 00:37:23.772 align:middle line:90%
that you kept blankets in.

00:37:23.772 --> 00:37:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do, don't you.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:25.248 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:37:25.248 --> 00:37:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
said you have my trunk

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and you keep the
blankets in there.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And you keep all
these things in there.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I still
look, it's like a cedar

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:90%
chest of some kind.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is a cedar chest.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
she tells me this.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.350 align:middle line:90%
She shows that me.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.476 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very aware of that.

00:37:35.476 --> 00:37:37.516 align:middle line:84%
She still likes those
blankets that are in there.

00:37:37.516 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:90%
She made some of them.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
She loves that.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.842 align:middle line:84%
And you please
honor those things.

00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I worked really hard
to make that happen,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.030 align:middle line:90%
she's going on about.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I got that, right?

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So we're going
to go back and forth here.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's see what we get.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.129 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:50.129 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd like-- I got to
bring her first, this lady,

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
because she's really strong.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about a
carpet or a rug at your place

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.390 align:middle line:90%
where you live now.

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:58.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So, where you live,
and I'm not sure

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.041 align:middle line:84%
if it's the living
room area, there's

00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:84%
a oval carpet or a
rug of some kind.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: There is a rug.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
She's going on and
she's making me--

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.020 align:middle line:90%
she's very finicky, very picky.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:09.180 align:middle line:90%
She likes things in their place.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
She likes the
furniture in its place.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't like it
when it's not in its place.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.866 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you as you
sit there on the couch,

00:38:13.866 --> 00:38:15.600 align:middle line:84%
there could be a
chair over this way,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.500 align:middle line:90%
as I'm sitting on the couch.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.565 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have her chair.

00:38:17.565 --> 00:38:19.064 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
telling me this.

00:38:19.064 --> 00:38:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also, she's
bringing my mind to the rug.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's a stain or
there's a part of that rug--

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:25.892 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: There is.

00:38:25.892 --> 00:38:26.816 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:38:26.816 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:30.140 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, good.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.843 align:middle line:84%
Because she's just bringing
my mind to that space.

00:38:33.843 --> 00:38:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And when she goes and
sits down there with you,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
she's keeping on going

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.590 align:middle line:90%
to that stain on the carpet.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.947 align:middle line:90%
I need to replace that.

00:38:39.947 --> 00:38:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said you
need to replace that.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.670 align:middle line:90%
And she said-- she's rough.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.090 align:middle line:90%
She kept a nice home.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, she did.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're not a real
home keeper like she is, see.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:49.415 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, not at all.

00:38:49.415 --> 00:38:52.325 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she's-- oh,
she used to dust everything

00:38:52.325 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:90%
every Saturday.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.220 align:middle line:90%
She used to dust things.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.678 align:middle line:84%
She's used to have
her nice silver.

00:38:55.678 --> 00:38:56.612 align:middle line:90%
She likes her lamps.

00:38:56.612 --> 00:38:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Her lamps are very important.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Everything perfect.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know you must
have some of her lamps now.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:38:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't you?

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.643 align:middle line:90%
And she's telling me that.

00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you please respect
my things, would you?

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.860 align:middle line:90%
I know--

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, she's here!

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's here.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.694 align:middle line:90%
She's here.

00:39:07.694 --> 00:39:08.610 align:middle line:90%
She's definitely here.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I know I have a sister on
the other side as well.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.310 align:middle line:90%
So she's there with a sister.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
got to tell that.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very happy over here.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I feel that her sister
lightened her up a little bit.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.265 align:middle line:84%
She was a little too serious
sometimes down here sometimes.

00:39:17.265 --> 00:39:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
dad has also passed over.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your
father passed over.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And I got your dad as well.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.954 align:middle line:90%
So husband's coming in, too.

00:39:24.954 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Got to say I love you.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:26.799 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:39:26.799 --> 00:39:29.954 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry-- her
dad, your husband.

00:39:29.954 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you one thing about him.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.828 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for bringing her today.

00:39:33.828 --> 00:39:35.381 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you for that.

00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And your husband passed over,
you said as well, right,

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:90%
over this side of you.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And you-- are you
wearing his wedding band?

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.247 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mine.

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
still have his, though?

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:44.895 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He didn't have one.

00:39:44.895 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
didn't have one?

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We just
had fake plastic ones.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you have that?

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.085 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, of course.

00:39:49.085 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Well, I don't know.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling
me you have that.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know you
are looking at-- what's it,

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.119 align:middle line:90%
a photograph?

00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:56.910 align:middle line:84%
You must have been
looking at a photograph.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.122 align:middle line:90%
That is very recently.

00:39:59.122 --> 00:40:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I look
at photos daily.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Of him.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you know
anyone in your family who

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.660 align:middle line:90%
used to wear a uniform for work?

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My father
was in the military.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.858 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
father wore a uniform.

00:40:05.858 --> 00:40:06.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.475 align:middle line:84%
I know you must have a
photo of a uniform, with him

00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:09.016 align:middle line:90%
in a uniform.

00:40:09.016 --> 00:40:12.062 align:middle line:84%
And he's very dapper and
very handsome man, you see.

00:40:12.062 --> 00:40:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
at the beginning,

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.872 align:middle line:84%
he was right here as
well with the mother.

00:40:14.872 --> 00:40:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you, he
put up with a lot with her.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.990 align:middle line:90%
She's sweet, but man.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:23.580 align:middle line:90%
He deserves his place in Heaven.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your father--
that I want a relationship

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.150 align:middle line:90%
here with you.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm coming in here,
now we're going back.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.948 align:middle line:90%
We're jumping back and forth.

00:40:30.948 --> 00:40:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry here.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:90%
But I want to-- oh, God.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Your dad wants to say he has
a relationship with you now.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say that I'm sorry
or I felt isolated from you

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:46.214 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:40:46.214 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.796 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:47.796 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
it was very hard for you.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know I was very
much into myself.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:56.342 align:middle line:84%
And I know I was
little narcissistic.

00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, really.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Were you a dancer younger?

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Did you used to love to dance
when you were a young girl?

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Me?

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You betcha.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:05.502 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm getting
the sense of,

00:41:05.502 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know, she should go
back to when she used to dance,

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.782 align:middle line:84%
because she was happier
at 19 years of age

00:41:09.782 --> 00:41:11.540 align:middle line:90%
when she used to dance.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
really the place.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.516 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I loved dancing.

00:41:14.516 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: At 19
especially they give me.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.774 align:middle line:90%
19, dancing, loving, freedom.

00:41:18.774 --> 00:41:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loving it.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I want
you to do that more.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.030 align:middle line:84%
This man that comes in
who you were married to,

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:25.488 align:middle line:84%
who didn't talk to
you for a while,

00:41:25.488 --> 00:41:27.650 align:middle line:84%
too, that her father,
this person, I

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:31.062 align:middle line:84%
feel like I just want to say,
I've forgiven him in some ways.

00:41:31.062 --> 00:41:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
a lot more to do.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Got it?

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:38.102 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I got it.

00:41:38.102 --> 00:41:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know what,
we can't be experiencing

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.935 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating love
of the highest order

00:41:41.935 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
if we still hold
something within us

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't forgiven,
that we don't understand.

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.084 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say I have
empathy for this man, your dad.

00:41:50.084 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Why do I have empathy?

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
he knew any better.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.657 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he
knew any better.

00:41:54.657 --> 00:41:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So what good are
we if we can't show him better?

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.026 align:middle line:90%
We're just as good as he was.

00:42:02.026 --> 00:42:03.640 align:middle line:90%
We're going down to that level.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.640 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I understand.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.714 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you
need to teach him.

00:42:06.714 --> 00:42:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And we teach those on the other
side as well by living here,

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and how we deal with
situations, and how

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:90%
we forgive and move forward.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just got to say,
by your letting go

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and really releasing
that, that you're still

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.360 align:middle line:84%
holding on to
emotional scars here.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:84%
That in some way, he
said, he held you back

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:90%
from being who you are.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Or he held back your
life in some respects.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.664 align:middle line:90%
And he's sorry about that.

00:42:27.664 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you have two
kids, you have three kids.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:31.475 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:42:31.475 --> 00:42:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Me?

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have a
daughter that's deceased.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.070 align:middle line:90%
I have Kim.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And I raised my grandson.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.330 align:middle line:90%
So two to three.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.538 align:middle line:90%
See, isn't that interesting--

00:42:39.538 --> 00:42:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's two or three.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.903 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And can
I just say this to you

00:42:42.903 --> 00:42:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and your other daughter,
your sister that passes over,

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:90%
you're honoring her, too, right?

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:47.907 align:middle line:90%
Do you love her?

00:42:47.907 --> 00:42:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, very much.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you honor her?

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
just want, what I'm

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to you
is that energy of love

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that you have for one, the love
that you have for the daughter,

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I wish you would give it to
the father, of her father.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.562 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
maybe-- you just have to.

00:42:59.562 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
to work on that.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.390 align:middle line:90%
I will work on that.

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:02.265 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.086 align:middle line:84%
I know we all-- listen,
we're all works in progress.

00:43:05.086 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.249 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So just realize.

00:43:07.249 --> 00:43:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you
also, young lady,

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.830 align:middle line:90%
would you please forgive him?

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My father?

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.704 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:43:13.704 --> 00:43:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
just feel like I'm

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.120 align:middle line:84%
not-- I'm not there for you
when you were growing up.

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I was more.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry I
wasn't there, okay?

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.336 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that you're
a very independent soul

00:43:23.336 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and that you're OK
with that situation.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You picked that before you
came back on the Earth.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.410 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.152 align:middle line:84%
There feels as if--
and I know that I'm

00:43:29.152 --> 00:43:31.110 align:middle line:84%
getting this from these
different beings here--

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.400 align:middle line:90%
I know your sister's a guide.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.289 align:middle line:90%
This sister comes in.

00:43:33.289 --> 00:43:34.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she
was a step sister

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.038 align:middle line:90%
of yours or a natural sister.

00:43:36.038 --> 00:43:36.802 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Half.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Half sister.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know that looks
after you as well.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:42.991 align:middle line:90%
And I just want you to be happy.

00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:45.490 align:middle line:84%
There are moments of happiness
where you think you're happy.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.989 align:middle line:84%
And then, there's
still this holding

00:43:46.989 --> 00:43:48.270 align:middle line:90%
on to something from the past.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:51.989 align:middle line:90%
So I just got to go here.

00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I love your mother.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.380 align:middle line:90%
She's really strong.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.380 align:middle line:84%
She's the one holding it
all together, your mom.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.963 align:middle line:84%
And I'm gonna say,
yeah, and I'm going

00:43:57.963 --> 00:44:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to say she was a bit of pain
in the ass when she was alive.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say that--
and lovingly I mean that.

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.381 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
I can describe her.

00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:06.561 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lovingly, OK.

00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loving in a
way that she was aggressive.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.870 align:middle line:90%
She was strong.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:11.680 align:middle line:90%
She was a strong lady.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.055 align:middle line:84%
And you're a very
sensitive soul.

00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:90%
And you're an empath.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you were
a young girl, when

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:84%
you were a young
girl sensitive, you

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:90%
didn't understand her energy.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.690 align:middle line:84%
You didn't understand why
she would say certain things

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:21.898 align:middle line:90%
or go about it a certain way.

00:44:21.898 --> 00:44:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And she'd be go, go, go, go.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:90%
And you're just not that way.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.854 align:middle line:90%
You're a very sensitive person.

00:44:26.854 --> 00:44:27.770 align:middle line:90%
So I need to say that.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I meant it.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how I mean it.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:31.271 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:44:31.271 --> 00:44:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I think she's great, but the
personality that you would know

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.345 align:middle line:84%
of as that woman who was
your mother in that respect.

00:44:36.345 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It makes sense.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.385 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:44:39.385 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:90%
A question you might have.

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.350 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have this
question of constantly--

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I knew
you had a question.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm psychic.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.722 align:middle line:90%
I knew this.

00:44:48.722 --> 00:44:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I want to know
why my husband had to die.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:54.642 align:middle line:90%


00:44:54.642 --> 00:44:56.401 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Go on.

00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.030 align:middle line:90%
He's very considerate, you know.

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.300 align:middle line:90%
He's a very considerate man.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why he let these
people speak first.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.183 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way he is.

00:45:02.183 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:90%
He would step in the background.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.290 align:middle line:84%
He'd let others come first,
and then he comes back.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.019 align:middle line:84%
The man with the
uniform is helping him.

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:10.310 align:middle line:84%
This man in the uniform is
helping him to come in here.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.160 align:middle line:90%
So I got to tell you that.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.920 align:middle line:84%
You said your grandfather
or whatever it was.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My father.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.638 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The father, he's
helping him to come through.

00:45:15.638 --> 00:45:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that you want--
oh, how interesting.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling me I had
to go in order for you

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.580 align:middle line:90%
to be who you are right now.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So in the human condition,
we have to go through pain.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard thing.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a hard thing.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And we can't say why things
happen at that moment

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.420 align:middle line:84%
right now, because it's not
necessarily a good answer

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to say it happened
because of this reason.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.160 align:middle line:90%
There's a process.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you live life,
you will find out

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why
it happened maybe

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.820 align:middle line:84%
was to help you to
help somebody else,

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.060 align:middle line:84%
to influence someone else,
to meet somebody else.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.702 align:middle line:84%
There's always a reason
behind something.

00:45:48.702 --> 00:45:49.702 align:middle line:90%
He said it was his time.

00:45:49.702 --> 00:45:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.853 align:middle line:90%
You don't accept that.

00:45:54.853 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was so
young, so it was hard.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let
me explain to you this.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Souls only-- don't know time.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Souls know experiences.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So some souls come
back for two years.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Some come back for 10 years.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Some come for 20 years.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Some leave by being
hit by a train.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Some go by a heart attack.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Some go by disease.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how a soul goes.

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:84%
We're here for
growth of the soul.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.960 align:middle line:84%
In the human
comprehension, we try

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to put human concepts
and understandings

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.560 align:middle line:90%
on something which is spiritual.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard for us to have
a complete reasons why.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.376 align:middle line:84%
I just know that
he said that you

00:46:26.376 --> 00:46:28.250 align:middle line:84%
have to be who you are
today because of this.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.700 align:middle line:84%
That you wouldn't-- now you
might not understand it,

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.294 align:middle line:90%
but later on you'll understand.

00:46:31.294 --> 00:46:33.710 align:middle line:84%
How about him wanting to be a
guide of yours in the spirit

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.369 align:middle line:90%
world?

00:46:34.369 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
How about him being
able to do more for you

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.381 align:middle line:90%
over there than over here?

00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And how about that
was the agreement

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.754 align:middle line:84%
before he came back into
the three dimension?

00:46:40.754 --> 00:46:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So did he
fulfill his mission here?

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.215 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
think he's trying

00:46:44.215 --> 00:46:46.405 align:middle line:90%
to if you'd open up your mind.

00:46:46.405 --> 00:46:47.160 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:51.020 align:middle line:84%
You can help him more by
letting him be there with you,

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.690 align:middle line:84%
influence you, helping
you, growing with you,

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.110 align:middle line:90%
expanding you.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But instead, you don't give
him some room to do that.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm still in the grief.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm still, why me?

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Why would God do that?

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:90%
How could he do that?

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And you see it as a punishment.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.936 align:middle line:90%
It's not a punishment.

00:47:08.936 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not a punishment, okay?

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you crawl into
bed by the way,

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:17.910 align:middle line:84%
when he was on the bed, when
he was sick and you crawled in?

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes,
in the hospital.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
I want to hold on to this hair.

00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I know that I want
a piece of the hair.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
that, Yes or no?

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
See, it's always the living
that I have a problem with that.

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.470 align:middle line:90%
The dead are fine.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.060 align:middle line:90%
It's the living people.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you
still hold on to me.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.900 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.215 align:middle line:84%
You still hold on to me in
a way that you shouldn't.

00:47:36.215 --> 00:47:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Now for me to tell you this,
honey, it's not easy for me,

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a healer.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.934 align:middle line:84%
I know you have my box,
the box there of me.

00:47:42.934 --> 00:47:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I don't
know if it's ashes,

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.420 align:middle line:90%
but you have them right there.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:45.850 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:46.516 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
you look at them every day.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you've made
that your mission in life.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want you
to do that anymore.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Let me be free.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm not
free, you're not free.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.920 align:middle line:90%
So he just wants you to be free.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.240 align:middle line:90%
So if you could do that.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a process, but it's
not a punishment, I promise.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So I also want you to ask for
him to come in your dreams

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.470 align:middle line:90%
when you're not in control.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.345 align:middle line:84%
Because, you k now,
you're all about control,

00:48:14.345 --> 00:48:18.314 align:middle line:90%
boy, control freak.

00:48:18.314 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
maybe that's why he

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:23.380 align:middle line:84%
left, because you can't
control it, right.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lesson about control.

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a lesson about surrender.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So some things in our life,
we can't control what happens.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.509 align:middle line:84%
But we certainly can control
how we respond to things.

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So, would you know that
you can control how

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.480 align:middle line:90%
you respond to things.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.090 align:middle line:90%
You always have his love.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.260 align:middle line:90%
Don't think of him as dead.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.610 align:middle line:90%
He's not.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.680 align:middle line:90%
He died once.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.759 align:middle line:84%
Don't make him die every
day with your thoughts.

00:48:43.759 --> 00:48:44.800 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, ladies.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.526 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:46.526 --> 00:48:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
very, very true

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.814 align:middle line:84%
in that I want you all to know
that Heaven is all around you.

00:48:54.814 --> 00:48:56.730 align:middle line:84%
In order for you to get
there-- sometimes when

00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:57.800 align:middle line:84%
you go to sleep at
night, we always

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.216 align:middle line:84%
go to Heaven and visit it and
go to those different realms

00:49:00.216 --> 00:49:00.760 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.239 align:middle line:84%
So at night if you can
go into your dream state,

00:49:03.239 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:84%
look around and see where
you are, because you'll

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.000 align:middle line:84%
be in Heaven in one
of those levels.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And just have a
journal next to the bed

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and maybe write about
it, where you end up.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you everyone very much.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.965 align:middle line:84%
And love and light until
I see you next time.

00:49:12.965 --> 00:49:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:30.534 align:middle line:90%
