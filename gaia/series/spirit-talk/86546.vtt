00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.806 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.103 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:36.045 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hi.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And thank you at home
for joining us also

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.077 align:middle line:84%
on "Spirit Talk," where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
On today's show, I
thought we'd do something

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
which many, many
people have asked

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.060 align:middle line:84%
me to do from the emails I've
received and my Facebook page.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And they want to know about
mediumship, which is what I do.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.392 align:middle line:90%
I'm a medium.

00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I might look like a small,
but I'm actually a medium.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it would be
really, really-- not only fun,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
but informative
to help you to be

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
able to reach the spirit
world on your own.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
that everybody necessarily

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
needs to go see
a medium, per se,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to interact
with the spirit world.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.536 align:middle line:84%
I think everybody
is a medium, per se.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are different people

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:90%
have different frequencies.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Or like a radio, you're tuned
into a different frequency.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
everybody at least

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is able to receive an
impression from spirit.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
They might not be clear as
far as what a message is,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
or be able to get a
personality, but at least they

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:84%
can definitely touch the spirit,
have the spirit world touch

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So I thought today, as
we do this in the studio

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and at home, that
we would help you

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to learn the basics
of what I've learned

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in my many years
of doing mediumship

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and to work with
the spirit world.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Sound good?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.006 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yay!

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.464 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'd do several
different exercises,

00:01:57.464 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and everyone at home
watching, also, you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:90%
can do these exercises.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
You might need somebody
to do them with at home,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.687 align:middle line:84%
because we're
having people here,

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
so it would be helpful
to have someone

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:90%
to do it with instead of no one.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So, first and foremost,
I want to tell you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit world
is not a place which

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
is up there in the
heavens and in the cloud.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world is
really another dimension,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's right next to us.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit world
touches us every day.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
clouds or ether,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.547 align:middle line:84%
so they come right-- we
share a space with them.

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:28.755 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want you to think
that the spirit world is

00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:90%
up far, far away, in heaven.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Heaven is around us.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
different frequency.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just a different dimension.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So we are, first and
foremost, spirit beings

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:90%
having a physical experience.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Having this human experience.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So start thinking of yourself
as a spirit, as a soul,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:90%
having a human experience.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:90%
And you just have to be.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:90%
You just have to be.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you work
with mediumship,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
with psychic phenomena, with
healing work, the first space

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
you must get into, and to be
aware of, and really to live,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:90%
is the heart space.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Is right here.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
This is where the soul resides,
right here in the heart.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And the more you can get in
that space of love, which

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is what we are, we're
pure love beings, yes?

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:90%
Then we're in.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We can hear, we can feel,
we can see the spirit world,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
and we can have even a better
relationship with who we are.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:90%
We learn who we are.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.362 align:middle line:90%
We know who we are.

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:84%
We have that relationship
with ourselves.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But it all starts
from the heart.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It starts from
that loving space.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe that every
single person is God.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't get caught up in
a religious connotation of what

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
God is, but I would say God
is that omnipresent, nurturing

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
That oneness which
we all are a part of.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:90%
Or that oneness of energy.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So whatever works for you in
your world of what God means,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:90%
fine.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say love.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Pure love.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:90%
No judgment, pure love.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
enter into a world

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
where you work with the
intuition and the sensitivity,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
that you really have to
work from a space of love.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The word intuition
means into the soul.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a language of the soul,
and that's what happens.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.494 align:middle line:84%
We use our intuition
every single day.

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
What-- the choices
that we make in life,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
we feel about something first,
and we use our intuition.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
If the phone rings, and
you think of who it is,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
or you get a flash of somebody,
it's-- and it's that person,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:84%
that's your intuition, your
soul language, speaking to you.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.269 align:middle line:84%
So if you can rely more on your
feelings, your gut, your gut,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.540 align:middle line:90%
instead of the head, right?

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember, this really
gets in the way sometimes.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
The brain,
rationalization, reasoning,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do
with intuition.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's two different
languages whatsoever.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the
spirit world around you,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and they want to communicate,
which they do all the time,

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
how often are we
closing them off?

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
How often are we just
trying to reason, justify,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and closing the door,
because we're not

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:90%
listening with our hearts.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
You will always be right if
you go with your first gut.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Your first gut instinct.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
You'll always be
right with that.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really important
that you understand that.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit world always
wants to communicate with you.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:84%
They try to communicate with
you, whether through signs,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:84%
let's say, maybe they'll be able
to affect the magnetic field

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
of electricity, and
lights blink on and off.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they'll come
through your dream state.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you'll see somebody,
and you'll look at them,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and it looks-- reminds you of
your spirit friend or family

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:90%
member.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Because the spirit is actually
next to you, projecting

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.332 align:middle line:84%
a thought, an image
into your mind.

00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at someone,
you'll know-- you'll see them.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the spirit project
upon that person's face.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So they come through
any way they can.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Certain expressions
people use could

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
be from the spirit
influencing them.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.675 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is a medium from
one degree or another.

00:05:35.675 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And what is a medium?

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.800 align:middle line:84%
A medium is someone who is just
bringing through that energy.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.591 align:middle line:84%
It's just bringing
through the energy.

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So, today I'd like to help
you to tune into the spirit

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:90%
world that is always around you.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And receive messages.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And the messages are
very, very subtle.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very subtle.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's often like a feather
in the wind, riding the wind.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So the more subtle, the
more nuances, the easier

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
it'll be for the
spirit to come in.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.443 align:middle line:90%
going to do a little meditation.

00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
just have you relax.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And this meditation is
really designed to really

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
to become present in our own
space, in our own auric field.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And to really want-- I want
you to just open yourself up

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:90%
to begin to feel.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I'm going
to do in this meditation

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.210 align:middle line:84%
is really a blending exercise,
where you open yourself

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
up to whoever comes through,
whether you know this person

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It might be a relative of
yours, might be a friend,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
might be a neighbor,
might be an animal.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:90%
We never know.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
We really give ourselves
up to the spirit

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:90%
and let them take over.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
In the second part, I'll have
you just connect to yourself.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So just close your eyes and
become aware of your space.

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to hear
music behind me as I speak.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And just-- I want you to
take this moment, this time,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.625 align:middle line:90%
and make it really count.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:90%
All of us together in one space.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Whether someone's watching this,
or you're here in the studio,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
we must realize that we will
never, ever be together again

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:90%
as one unit.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So we sit together now as
one unit, as one being,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
as one breath.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:90%
As one breath, as one heartbeat.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:90%
As one being.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And just be aware of that
beautiful space, your heart.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Your heart space.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.815 align:middle line:90%
The space of the soul.

00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Where the soul resides,
so beautifully tucked

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:90%
behind the heart.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:84%
You are a beautiful
light, and I just

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%
want to reflect right now on
this beautiful light which

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:90%
God makes no mistakes.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:90%
There are no mistakes.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.185 align:middle line:84%
The human makes mistakes when
they question their God self.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:90%
When they question that light.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But light always will
be, always has been.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.076 align:middle line:84%
And the more we give it power
through a thought of love,

00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:90%
the more that light shines.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like for us all to
imagine way, way above us,

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in the spheres above us, there
are many beings, many guides,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
many angels, many loved ones,
who are here just for you.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Are so interested
in your progress.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
They are here to help guide
you, to make you more aware,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.770 align:middle line:90%
to make to open up to the truth.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just open
up our hearts and our minds

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:90%
by using the breath.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.925 align:middle line:84%
And with the breath,
as we inhale,

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:53.310 align:middle line:84%
we can imagine a
beautiful golden light,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
with the awareness
that we are closer

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:90%
to the world of the spirit.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.975 align:middle line:84%
And as we exhale
out of our mouths,

00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
we're going to let go of the
old ways of thinking about who

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
we are, what we are, this
world that we walk upon.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And with each inhalation,
we step closer and closer

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to spirit.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So together, let's bring this
beautiful light, this feeling

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
of love, this feeling of
spirit, and welcome them

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.372 align:middle line:90%
in with just a thought.

00:09:27.372 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:90%
With just a prayer.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And just inhale, and holding it,
two, three, four, and exhale.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the old.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.575 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, bringing in the
beautiful light and the spirit.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Dear spirit friends, come close.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Holding it, two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Just realizing that a light
within you is shining,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.410 align:middle line:84%
is a great need of the spirit,
and they see your light.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.961 align:middle line:84%
Your light, you send out a light
to them, the beautiful spirit

00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:15.460 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
They see this beacon
of light which you are,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and they come close.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Just sending out
a thought to them.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friend,
come close to me now.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And with your thought,
just send out permission.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Send out this lovely thought
which says, spirit friends,

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:84%
come so close to me
right now, as I sit here

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to become an instrument
of the spirit.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:46.800 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And welcome them,
whoever it might be,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:90%
to stand right behind you.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Just stand right
behind you to share

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.310 align:middle line:84%
that space which is
right behind you.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And welcome them
with your light.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Give them one more chance to
feel the physical vibration,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this human
world one more time.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.492 align:middle line:84%
Invite them so close now,
whoever might show up,

00:11:18.492 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
whoever has the greatest
need to step into your space,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:90%
right behind you.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And just welcome
whoever it might be.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And let them now put their
hands upon your shoulders.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends, we
know of the great need.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.070 align:middle line:90%
You need to come through.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
We invite you now to come
through, to be a part of us,

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:90%
to share this space and be one.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And let them come so close,
your feet become their feet.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Your legs are now their legs.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are their arms.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
You see the eyes, they use
your eyes as their eyes.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Your ears as their ears.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.835 align:middle line:90%
Your voice as their voice.

00:12:09.835 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Your body as their body.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And just step aside
and let them come in.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the
love that they have.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Feel the personality.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Just feel with your heart as
they adjust within your being.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It may be someone
you have not thought

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:90%
about for quite a while.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.035 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody you're
not even aware of.

00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
But let them come in
fully, integrate fully.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a male or
female, whoever it might be,

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
let them experience
the human awareness,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:90%
the human levels, one more time.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And let it be.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And feel, let them
feel, let them use you,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.754 align:middle line:90%
let them be part of you.

00:13:12.754 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:84%
As they blend with your
thoughts, blend with your body,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.904 align:middle line:90%
blend with your mind, very good.

00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And now thank them,
send them appreciation

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
for stepping into this
space, and now ask them

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
telepathically and gently,
dear spirit friend,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
you may back up now,
step outside the body.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.891 align:middle line:84%
Stand behind me
now at this time.

00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:52.035 align:middle line:84%
Put your hands back on my
shoulders as you step behind.

00:13:52.035 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being here.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for your presence.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
infusing your energy

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
with my energy, so you may
experience the human world one

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
more time, and what
that body feels like.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:18.735 align:middle line:84%
And let them then step further
behind, and take a deep breath.

00:14:18.735 --> 00:14:19.235 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And slowly be aware of
your body, your own body.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful of your feet
on the floor, of your legs,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
your backs on the chairs,
your shoulders and your arms.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Your neck and your heads.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And then another deep breath
going back into your own body,

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.020 align:middle line:90%
inhale.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.032 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:14:43.032 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Feeling it, bringing
it back in the body.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Feeling your body, feeling once
again connected with yourself.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Now one last time, fully
back in the body, and inhale.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And open your eyes.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And put your arms
up and stretch.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Wiggle your fingers
and your toes.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Feeling back in the body.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.956 align:middle line:90%
Wave hi.

00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Good.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.436 align:middle line:90%
And applaud.

00:15:08.436 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to just-- I
just want to just ask you

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.480 align:middle line:84%
what your experience was,
because everybody here

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
had a different
experience, of course.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.494 align:middle line:84%
And there were
some of you that I

00:15:20.494 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:84%
saw with the auric field, where
the spirit was right there,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and it comes right--
partially to you.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you felt
a male presence with you,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
but there was definitely a m--
did you feel a male presence?

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.689 align:middle line:84%
Felt a male right--
drop right in.

00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
felt the presence drop

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.202 align:middle line:90%
in when they just allowed them?

00:15:36.202 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Two, three, four.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very good.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if it was hard for
you, you're in control mode.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Ah, control, I can't
give away control.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.496 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, oh, I've got
to-- I can't give away control.

00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:90%
When really, we have no control.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:90%
There is no control.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
You cannot control other
people, you cannot control

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:84%
your situations,
you can't control.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So for all you control freaks
out there, there is no control.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.070 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you
can control are

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
how you react to someone
else's experiences with you.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
How they treat you, how
you deal with a scenario,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:90%
what someone says to you.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I often say that
karma, how people

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:90%
treat you is their karma.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.642 align:middle line:90%
How you react is your karma.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have the choice of
how you're going to respond

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
and how you're going to react.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.473 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to share some
of the experiences you had.

00:16:23.473 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Who would like to share?

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to share?

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's very
emotional, I can see it.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
So what did you feel?

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just felt
something behind me,

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.842 align:middle line:90%
and then my stomach--

00:16:34.842 --> 00:16:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your stomach
started getting energetic.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Very,
very energetic.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did you
feel a male or a female?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A male.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A male.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, a male.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did you allow
them to come into the body?

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And what did you feel
once that manifested?

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just my heart
started beating faster.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:90%
And my stomach rolling.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tell
you what that is.

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world,
the spirit people,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.076 align:middle line:84%
are on a very fast
vibration or frequency.

00:17:02.076 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So in that dimension, it
vibrates very, very quick,

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:90%
very, very fast.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Where they're at, right?

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Because all around us, we
really have different types

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:90%
of waves around us.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.505 align:middle line:84%
Microwaves, gamma rays,
all different types

00:17:11.505 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:90%
of waves around us.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:90%
Radio waves, television waves.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't see, for
instance, television waves.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the picture of the
screen or the television show

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
in front of us,
but yet it's there.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's at a faster
vibration, a faster frequency.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.990 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond the human bandwidth.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So when spirit come
into ourselves,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:84%
this human condition,
they have to slow down

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.810 align:middle line:84%
their frequency,
their vibration.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And many times, the human will
feel that as a quickening.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:90%
Very quick.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me
definitely you felt that.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.488 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:40.488 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely
was a male feeling.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I agree with it.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, did it feel like
someone you knew,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.496 align:middle line:90%
or someone you did not know?

00:17:45.496 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think it was?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.165 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad.

00:17:47.165 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
was your father.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you,
it was your father.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Very, very much so.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And his condition before he
passed over affected the heart?

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.552 align:middle line:84%
Was the heart affected before
he passed over as well?

00:17:55.552 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.051 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:17:57.051 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, what you
picked up from your father,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:84%
were the last
conditions before he

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
passed into the other dimension,
and that's the physical stuff,

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:84%
in his stomach was going
on, and his heart, yeah?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So that was also, not
only did you pick up

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of the
spirit, but you picked up

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the-- we call them the death
conditions, or conditions

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.375 align:middle line:84%
of the body before they
passed into spirit.

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:16.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.107 align:middle line:84%
And go ahead and give
her a round of applause.

00:18:21.107 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Who would like to take
a shot at mediumship?

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
At giving spirit--
giving a message?

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:90%
You would?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Come on up baby, great.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So I know just by your
energy that you're

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.587 align:middle line:84%
somebody who's like a
lot of people out there.

00:18:35.587 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:10%
We want love in our lives, and
sometimes we think in our head,

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:10%
we've got to give, give,
give, in order to get love.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:84%
That's really--
that's an illusion.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's really--
we'll get to a point

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:84%
where we're so worn
out, and we want

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.785 align:middle line:84%
people to love us so badly,
that we'll just really sacrifice

00:18:50.785 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:90%
our own happiness.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.045 align:middle line:10%
So you can be more effective
and have more love in your life

00:18:56.045 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:10%
if you'll be who you are.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:10%
And you're that
loving light, shining.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:10%
And just by being you,
you can teach people,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.930 align:middle line:10%
you can help people, and
you can reach more people.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I asked
if someone wants

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
to come up and learn mediumship,
or work with me as a medium,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:90%
you raised your hand right away.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.621 align:middle line:90%
You said yes.

00:19:10.621 --> 00:19:13.832 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me, inside of you,
there's a sense of compassion.

00:19:13.832 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a sense of
wanting to help.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:90%
And that there's a desire.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to help with that.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.535 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have
you to stand here.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have you
just take the microphone.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll bring
the microphone, OK?

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
just stand here.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.069 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to close your eyes.

00:19:29.069 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:30.693 align:middle line:90%
And I'm right next to you.

00:19:30.693 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm your guide.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:90%
So just think I'm your angel.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:10%
And I just want you to be
mindful now of the first things

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:10%
you think of.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:10%
The first feelings
that you have.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:10%
I just want you to
invite the spirit in.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:10%
Whoever wants to come in.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You don't know who it is.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be for
somebody in this audience,

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:45.827 align:middle line:90%
and you're not sure who it is.

00:19:45.827 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:10%
So just give me the
first impressions,

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:10%
and I'll work with you.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just smiling.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.616 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Smiling.

00:19:51.616 --> 00:19:52.981 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And
lots of laughing.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.255 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lots of laughing,
so it's a spirit that's joyful,

00:19:57.255 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:90%
and laughter, very good.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.517 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A lot of nervous.

00:20:01.517 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A lot
of nervous energy.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.521 align:middle line:84%
It may be the first
time they've done this.

00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:90%
You're not sure.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Does it feel male or
female or a child?

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Or what does it feel like?

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Female.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
feels like a female.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:90%
So, great.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Then welcome them in,
invite them in, great.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:90%
They're next to you.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.458 align:middle line:90%
They're right with you.

00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have a female here
who's very joyful, very happy,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.201 align:middle line:90%
a little nervous.

00:20:20.201 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:90%
What else can we get from that?

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.119 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think pain.

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Pain.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And is there physical
pain or emotional pain?

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.872 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
emotional pain.

00:20:30.872 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Emotional pain.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's not theirs.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.108 align:middle line:84%
That they maybe passed
over, that there's

00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
some emotional pain
that's not theirs.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.491 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:37.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Very good, very good.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And this person
that passed over,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
this woman, does
it feel like when

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:84%
she passed she
was later in life,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.697 align:middle line:84%
or was she earlier in
life, or was she in her--

00:20:46.697 --> 00:20:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Mid--
mid, middle of life.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:48.511 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Middle.

00:20:48.511 --> 00:20:50.011 align:middle line:10%
Probably 50s, maybe
40s, 50s, 60s?

00:20:50.011 --> 00:20:50.886 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, wait.

00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I guess, middle of life.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's all right.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.441 align:middle line:90%
Just go with what--

00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:55.792 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Earlier in
life than maybe, like, me.

00:20:55.792 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.167 align:middle line:90%
Like your age.

00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know how old you are.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:58.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm 35. [GIGGLES]

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
not going to ask.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.167 align:middle line:90%
So 35, around that age, 35.

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:03.250 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So it feels like a soul that
was young when she passed over,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.366 align:middle line:84%
and that she left
with emotional pain,

00:21:08.366 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
or there's emotional
pain with somebody here.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:10%
You're doing
really, really well.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.171 align:middle line:10%
And good.

00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:10%
And invite her in.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.822 align:middle line:10%
I think you've already
done the hardest work.

00:21:16.822 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Come on in.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Come on in.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:90%
You've identified it's a female.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
You identified the age, around
the age she passed over.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
How happy and joyful it
is, but there's emotion.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um--

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So,
become an actress.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Let her take on you.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:90%
You're taking on that role.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You're taking that
role, that spirit.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the character,
you're the actress.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.047 align:middle line:90%
What does she feel like to you?

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Excited.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.046 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's excited.

00:21:39.046 --> 00:21:40.627 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: To--

00:21:40.627 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Communicate.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.115 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Communicate.

00:21:42.115 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: To be here.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.760 align:middle line:90%
To talk.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.325 align:middle line:84%
And can she tell us anything
about maybe how she passed?

00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Did she pass inside,
or the outside,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:90%
or anything at all with that?

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Or any of it mean something?

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um--

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.229 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't
think, just feel.

00:21:59.229 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
just wants to say,

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:90%
she wants to express herself.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.088 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let
her express herself.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.452 align:middle line:90%
Before her time.

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, that's
what I'm trying to say.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know, I'm psychic.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.872 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:11.872 --> 00:22:12.701 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:10%
So don't get caught up in it.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:90%
There's no right or wrong.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:90%
You're just feeling.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.309 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So she really wants to come
through, and she's excited.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And she belongs to somebody here
in this audience, I'm assuming.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's a woman, she's around
35, mid time of her life.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.770 align:middle line:90%
She passes over.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.429 align:middle line:84%
Did she pass over quickly,
or was it a long time?

00:22:29.429 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel
like it was quick.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
was a quick passing.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And it was--

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
a quick passing.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --it
was a very sad--

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A
very sad situation.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: --situation.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.986 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
passed away sad.

00:22:37.986 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Now keep on going with that.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.877 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Um,
it was a big loss.

00:22:42.877 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It was a big loss.

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Was it an expected loss?

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Was there a surprise
element about it?

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was a surprise.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There
was a surprise element.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:48.804 align:middle line:90%
But is-- OK.

00:22:48.804 --> 00:22:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Can we relate to that?

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Anybody in the audience?

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I thought so.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to let
this woman in and repeat

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
the information she
has already given you.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.505 align:middle line:84%
So she's happy, and just keep
on repeating it out loud.

00:22:58.505 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
really excited.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Really happy to be
able to be here.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
To say that she's really
sorry to have left early.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty
sad, I'm guessing.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't guess.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Just feel it.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.979 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel
like I'm s-- OK.

00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.605 align:middle line:90%
It's like writing a letter.

00:23:15.605 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:90%
It's like, I feel sad.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I left early.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:90%
I left an emotional--

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.717 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm so good now.

00:23:20.717 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So good now.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel
really, really good.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.565 align:middle line:90%
Happy.

00:23:23.565 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Go with that.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.770 align:middle line:90%
Go with that good feeling.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Like,
don't be sad for me.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.845 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't be sad.

00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:31.385 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Don't
be sad for yourself.

00:23:31.385 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.718 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she
died on the inside?

00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:34.577 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:23:34.577 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Just let her speak--

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.565 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was
really, really fast.

00:23:36.565 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Really fast.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:90%
It was really fast.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
was really fast.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very, unexpected.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very unexpected.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And um--

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she had
emotional stuff going on.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
You realize that.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That was sad.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:90%
So she had emotional stuff.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm helping you.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.730 align:middle line:84%
You're helping me,
and I'm helping you,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'm inviting
her in my mind.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending out thoughts
to blend with us.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sending,
I'm saying, please

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:90%
give us more information.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:90%
So you might get something.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll get something.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it together.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.758 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:23:57.758 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting emotional
upheaval with this woman.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling that
she doesn't feel

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
like it was her life, that she
lived other people's lives.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
there was a marriage

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.485 align:middle line:84%
or there was a
relationship problem.

00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it's
definitely a situation

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:90%
which was out of her control.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
couldn't handle it.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I know she tried running away
from that situation many times.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:15.215 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You get that?

00:24:15.215 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Was
she around my age?

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was
she around her age?

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't it
interesting also, Molly,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that a spirit will come
close to you around your age?

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they can use
your reference library,

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.495 align:middle line:90%
what your life experience is.

00:24:28.495 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So of course she'll pick
you to come through,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:84%
because you're
her age, you might

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.240 align:middle line:84%
understand some of
the emotional things

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.380 align:middle line:90%
she might have gone through.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:90%
You can pick up on that.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:35.576 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what I-- was she-- do you
mind if I ask you a question?

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.615 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Go.

00:24:38.615 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Was she like,
really physically well, or maybe

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:90%
not so much.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think she might
have had an eating disorder.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Or there might have been
something with the--

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.425 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:24:49.425 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:90%
There was an eating disorder.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:51.053 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:51.053 --> 00:24:51.416 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I do feel that with her.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel there was a really bad
self image with this woman.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I feel that
there was some religion early

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.635 align:middle line:90%
on her life.

00:24:57.635 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
she had a fall into,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and that really
wasn't who she was.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Correct?

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.891 align:middle line:84%
So I know there was some kind
of abuse, drug abuse or alcohol

00:25:05.891 --> 00:25:06.825 align:middle line:90%
abuse at the time.

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:07.491 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
what-- that's what, oh.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.805 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's what-- how--

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:10.638 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hello.

00:25:10.638 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Do you see
the light bulb? [LAUGHS]

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:13.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:90%
You feel it?

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.793 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
got it, you feel it?

00:25:15.793 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Yep, go, go.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.677 align:middle line:84%
Keep on even going
faster now with her.

00:25:18.677 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you're in there, now you
can trust it and go with her.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Give her the energy, and say
to this girl-- keep on going,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:90%
honey.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Bring it in.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:90%
Bring it in.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's just
laughing and smiling.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Celebrating.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Like, having
a party all the time.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
how she was here.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
She's a party girl.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, she was
always a party girl.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
was a party girl.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
was a party girl.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:90%
She used to also--

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.673 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
doesn't want you she's

00:25:39.673 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:90%
so excited to see you smile.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Lights up the world.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.929 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She's just so happy.

00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You have
goosebumps all over.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Keep on going.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Look at the healing
you're bringing.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
like, don't stop.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't stop.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Just tell her she
looks beautiful.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.346 align:middle line:90%
Don't be sad.

00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.312 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Anymore. [LAUGHS]

00:25:57.312 --> 00:25:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was there
a child that was there?

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.110 align:middle line:90%
She lost a baby.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Was something with a baby?

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Was she pregnant, didn't
have the pregnancy?

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
The pregnancy was at
full term, or there

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
was a pr-- you
understand that, right?

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my God!

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.594 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just
call me James.

00:26:07.594 --> 00:26:09.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:10.555 align:middle line:90%
You got that, right?

00:26:10.555 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Because when I first
saw everything,

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
it was woman, child,
woman, child, woman, child.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.116 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She left
three kids behind too.

00:26:17.116 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's not who I expected
to come through today,

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's who came
through when I did our--

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No, and
you don't expect it,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:90%
whoever comes through needs to.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.711 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
so?

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, and I
know if you check it out,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
there'd be one
baby that did not--

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I know.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
know about that.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's definitely some--

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
what I was thinking of.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
were picking up that.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can relate to
this sort of thing.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.000 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.781 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So feel the joy
your fr-- that the spirit has.

00:26:37.781 --> 00:26:39.363 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I know,
I can't stop like,

00:26:39.363 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
laughing on the inside
and I'm like about this--

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's her.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.351 align:middle line:90%
That's how she was.

00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --and I can't--
I'm right on the edge of like

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:90%
bawling, but I'm so excited.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.236 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, but I can't.

00:26:49.236 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Because I need to laugh.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I need to--

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have to honor her.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, laugh too.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's-- yeah.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
so happy right now.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Like, and always happy.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.921 align:middle line:84%
There is no sadness, and
ugliness left in her life

00:26:58.921 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:26:59.763 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:26:59.763 --> 00:27:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It was a lifetime about self.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.303 align:middle line:90%
Learning about self.

00:27:02.303 --> 00:27:03.692 align:middle line:84%
Trusting herself,
loving herself.

00:27:03.692 --> 00:27:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't do it.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't live up to
the father's expectations,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:90%
her family's expectations.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Mostly the father.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Because there's definitely
some karmic connection

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:90%
with her and her father.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She stands
up straight and tall.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's straight.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.086 align:middle line:90%
She's still now.

00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:15.849 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's so-- like--
just rocking it. [LAUGHS]

00:27:15.849 --> 00:27:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's rocking it.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I own this. [LAUGHS]

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.899 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did she used
to have the loose leaf binder?

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Used to write journals, or
do something with journals?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember that?

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I write journals.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>VAN PRAAGH: And you know
that, and drawing butterflies

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.792 align:middle line:84%
and flowers on the side, the
doodling she would do also.

00:27:29.792 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there was
a poem read at her service.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I know there were two
services, she's telling me.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know that-- two
services, distinctly different.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
One more family,
one more friends.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:39.854 align:middle line:90%
More hanging out.

00:27:39.854 --> 00:27:40.770 align:middle line:90%
She likes to hang out.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.338 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
a hanger outer.

00:27:42.338 --> 00:27:44.212 align:middle line:84%
She just likes nature,
she likes woods.

00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:45.420 align:middle line:90%
She likes that sort of thing.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I like the skies, I like the
sunsets, they're so big to me.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:90%
I like hot air ballooning.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to close
with her, what final messages

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.604 align:middle line:90%
or salutations would she say?

00:27:55.604 --> 00:27:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
let's establish,

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:84%
you're-- I don't know if you're
a family member or sister,

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.310 align:middle line:90%
or just a close friend of hers.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.895 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just a friend.

00:28:00.895 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But you feel
like a sister feeling.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.273 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I feel like-- do

00:28:04.273 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:90%
you feel like sister feeling?

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Like a sister.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.604 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, you're closer to
her than her family would be.

00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.259 align:middle line:84%
And was there someone
getting a tattoo about her?

00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
You thought about, or someone
thought about getting a tattoo?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It probably
was in regard to me

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.262 align:middle line:84%
that she-- they were thinking
of doing when she passed.

00:28:20.262 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Something to do with a
tattoo design or something.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
I had breast cancer.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.346 align:middle line:84%
So they were talking about
getting the pink ribbon.

00:28:26.346 --> 00:28:27.053 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:27.053 --> 00:28:28.356 align:middle line:90%
And the design tattoo thing.

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:28.856 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:28.856 --> 00:28:29.606 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:28:29.606 --> 00:28:30.335 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Whoa.

00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was that great?

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So thank her very much
for coming through.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um--

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
thank-- what else do you

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
want to say with
this lovely lady?

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I can't
thank you enough.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.481 align:middle line:90%
I can't thank you enough.

00:28:38.481 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I can't-- please
be happy always,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and share it with as
many people as you can,

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.610 align:middle line:90%
that she was so amazing.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've really been
going through a depression

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I lost two best friends in
the last year to suicide, so.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm so sorry.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
she comes in, maybe

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to speak for the
other friends as well.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know someone did pass

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.274 align:middle line:90%
with cancer, by the way.

00:28:56.274 --> 00:28:58.065 align:middle line:84%
There's somebody that's
passed with cancer.

00:28:58.065 --> 00:28:58.781 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:28:58.781 --> 00:28:59.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.455 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that
doesn't have to be you.

00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:90%
So stop making it you.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And it's not me.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:02.821 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:03.528 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:29:03.528 --> 00:29:04.037 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:29:04.037 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And thank your friend.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Can
I give you a hug?

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.171 align:middle line:90%
Give her a hug.

00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:14.410 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That was amazing.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Give
me a hug, too.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to miss out.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Very good job, sweetheart.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.478 align:middle line:90%
Give her a round of applause.

00:29:21.478 --> 00:29:22.242 align:middle line:90%
Watch your step.

00:29:22.242 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.367 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:29.325 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to come up?

00:29:29.325 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yep.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to just
pass the baton.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Leave the-- I'm going to
switch this and give this

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.763 align:middle line:84%
to you to hold onto
if you don't mind.

00:29:35.763 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:90%
And now, your name is?

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Liana.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Liana.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's an honor to work
with spirit like that.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.447 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor that she
came through like that.

00:29:43.447 --> 00:29:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's also, I'm going to
tell you that this was all

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.470 align:middle line:90%
set up before anyone comes here.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:49.587 align:middle line:84%
I think the spirit
world work things out.

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they're
really the puppet masters

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:52.970 align:middle line:90%
and we're just the puppets.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that was
planned probably for months.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:56.091 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:29:56.091 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And you've been asking
her to come through,

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and she wanted to.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
One more thing, I'm going
to ask you about turtles.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why I
want to say turtles--

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I'm
saying turtles to you,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:84%
because she's talking
about turtles.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
that makes sense?

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I went to Hawaii
a few months ago for the first

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.684 align:middle line:84%
time, and I had this amazing
experience with a sea turtle--

00:30:12.684 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With a turtle.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.933 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: --for an hour.

00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:17.432 align:middle line:84%
And it was just he and I. It
was-- yeah, it was amazing.

00:30:17.432 --> 00:30:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, it was from
her and your other friends,

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know you did a ceremony
over there in Hawaii.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you on
behalf of them for the ceremony

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.490 align:middle line:90%
that you did on their behalf.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.107 align:middle line:84%
And they watched
every bit of it.

00:30:28.107 --> 00:30:29.065 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:30:29.065 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yay.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.212 align:middle line:84%
And you must have also
had either shells or rocks

00:30:33.212 --> 00:30:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted to
bring back from there.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.586 align:middle line:90%
Understand that?

00:30:35.586 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:36.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're just
talking about that.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Good girl.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.519 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:40.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
just close our eyes,

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.381 align:middle line:84%
and I just want you to close
your-- put your arms down.

00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:90%
You're right here with me now.

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.916 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:30:46.916 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Get back into your heart space.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And now, so you've been
opened up beautifully

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
by these beings
that are around you.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
feel whoever you feel.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.480 align:middle line:90%
A male or a female.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.080 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel?

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.756 align:middle line:84%
With your heart, because you're
such an emotional person.

00:31:04.756 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Definitely
a male coming through.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A
male coming through.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.860 align:middle line:90%
So a male coming through.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.785 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
male feel like?

00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He feels older.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He feels
like an older male.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.998 align:middle line:90%
And older meaning what?

00:31:13.998 --> 00:31:14.796 align:middle line:90%
60s, 70s?

00:31:14.796 --> 00:31:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:90%
80s.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 80s.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So an older male,
80s, very good.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.898 align:middle line:90%
What does he feel like?

00:31:18.898 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He feels kind of
stocky, but not very tall.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.395 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Stocky
but not very tall.

00:31:23.395 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Broad shouldered.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Broad shouldered.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.389 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What's
his personality like?

00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He comes
across as kind of harsh,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.410 align:middle line:90%
but he's really not.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So he's
harsh, but inside he's soft.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.546 align:middle line:90%
With the exterior of being hard.

00:31:38.546 --> 00:31:39.046 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:39.046 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And give him a voice now.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.120 align:middle line:84%
You want to give
this man a voice.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His
voice is very gruff.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very gruff.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Very gruff.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Long upper
body, short legs.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Long
upper body, short legs.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:51.990 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.962 align:middle line:84%
And did he pass away
inside or outside?

00:31:54.962 --> 00:31:55.753 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Inside.

00:31:55.753 --> 00:31:56.627 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Inside.

00:31:56.627 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And was he on a bed,
or was he sitting down?

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
this man was in a bed.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was in a bed.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So, great.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So just kind of repeat
what you get to yourself.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.195 align:middle line:84%
I have a man here, and
just repeat it, honey.

00:32:07.195 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I have a man here
who is in a bed.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.310 align:middle line:90%
And he's definitely older.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.010 align:middle line:90%
In his 80s.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Probably mid 80s even.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mid 80s.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:90%
He feels very gruff.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.595 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very gruff.

00:32:19.595 --> 00:32:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.902 align:middle line:84%
Even at the end, but wasn't--
he probably came across as very

00:32:23.902 --> 00:32:25.360 align:middle line:84%
ungrateful, but
he's very grateful.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very grateful.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:26.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And he obviously belongs to
somebody here in this audience.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:30.738 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:30.738 --> 00:32:33.169 align:middle line:84%
And do you get a feel where
this man wants to go toward?

00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:34.960 align:middle line:84%
That side of the room
or that side of the--

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
I'm over here.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You want
to go over this side.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.805 align:middle line:90%
Over this side of the room.

00:32:37.805 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're drawn to the energy
to the left side of the room.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.861 align:middle line:84%
If you want to turn facing
that side of the room.

00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.139 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel anything around
here, where you want to go to.

00:32:46.139 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm here somewhere.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're right here.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.744 align:middle line:84%
So the information that was said
so far, does either one of you

00:32:50.744 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
understand that?

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Anybody this side
understand that?

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.560 align:middle line:90%
She understands that.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I can see his face.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
can see his face.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:32:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Describe it.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: To me, his
face is more square.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I see age spots along here.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.927 align:middle line:90%
Gray hair but olive tone skin.

00:33:07.927 --> 00:33:09.718 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
that's our grandfather.

00:33:09.718 --> 00:33:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It could be.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's grandpa.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.270 align:middle line:90%
You related?

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, sisters.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:13.974 align:middle line:90%
Are you sisters?

00:33:13.974 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So would you mind giving the
microphone to your sister,

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.221 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:33:17.221 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.920 align:middle line:90%
So what's your name?

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cindy.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.503 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cindy.

00:33:20.503 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:90%
So tell us which-- stand up.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.375 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Tell
us what you were--

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So, for some reason,
when you were describing him,

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking, well, why
would grandpa come through?

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:90%
But um--

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:29.938 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's up to him.

00:33:29.938 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was older,
and he-- he was-- he

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:90%
did die in a hospital bed.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was scared of him.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to him a lot
now, because I really

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
want-- I would love to
have our family ranch back.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So I always say,
grandpa, can you

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.217 align:middle line:84%
make it possible for me to
get part of our ranch back.

00:33:49.217 --> 00:33:49.925 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:50.410 align:middle line:90%
So let's stay with that.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And just see if that
makes sense to you?

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.015 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That does
make sense to me.

00:33:53.015 --> 00:33:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
does make sense?

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.830 align:middle line:90%
What else does he want to say?

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.676 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've located
where it belongs.

00:33:56.676 --> 00:33:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So the woman
is tied to him, too.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:33:59.655 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's a
woman tied to him too.

00:33:59.655 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.295 align:middle line:90%
It's our mother.

00:34:01.295 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your
mother's coming in with him.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:90%
This would be her father?

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
they're together.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She loved her daddy.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't tell us.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Let them tell you.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.466 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:09.466 --> 00:34:11.076 align:middle line:84%
No, I already know
that. [LAUGHS]

00:34:11.076 --> 00:34:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let--

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I am
not the medium, so--

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
you are a medium.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- so we have the
grandfather, man to the side.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:19.223 align:middle line:90%
We recognize who he is.

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring the
woman through now.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And let's have the
characteristics for her.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring through
her personality,

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.934 align:middle line:90%
or traits of her personality.

00:34:24.934 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
opposite of him.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
the opposite of him.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:90%
She says yes.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very happy go lucky.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:34.784 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:34.784 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
never really approved

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.738 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of the stuff he did.

00:34:37.738 --> 00:34:38.684 align:middle line:90%
You realize that?

00:34:38.684 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.850 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
wanted to do something

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:84%
with-- I know her name
is important to you.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And initial M. I don't
know why, but I see an M,

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:90%
like a Mary or an M name.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.975 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Our
grandmother is May.

00:34:52.975 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:90%
And her twin is Mary.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.613 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And our-- her--
our maiden name is Martinez,

00:34:57.613 --> 00:34:59.194 align:middle line:90%
so, there's lots of M's.

00:34:59.194 --> 00:34:59.902 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:59.902 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
There's the M's, like
[MAKING EXPLOSION SOUND] M,

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:90%
[MAKING EXPLOSION SOUND] good.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lotta M's.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So bring
some more of that mother.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:90%
We know it's a mother.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.209 align:middle line:84%
And what does that
mother feel like?

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the love of a
mother with a child,

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:90%
it's an incredible energy.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.584 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:11.584 --> 00:35:12.750 align:middle line:90%
So what is she feeling like?

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.390 align:middle line:84%
She's gotta be dancing
with joy right now.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
seems very happy.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.427 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like the
people here aren't.

00:35:19.427 --> 00:35:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's fighting
among the family members.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.465 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:22.465 --> 00:35:23.881 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:26.237 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.237 --> 00:35:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that, darling?

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But you do.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:90%
The other sister does.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't feel
like it's about the ranch,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.335 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
said a while ago.

00:35:33.335 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's something else.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.842 align:middle line:90%
Personal items or something?

00:35:38.842 --> 00:35:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
there's not fighting,

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.040 align:middle line:84%
but we have a lot of her
things we have to go through,

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and we just haven't
been willing to do it.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: The important
thing is that she is OK.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't suffering.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.257 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why she
keeps saying that.

00:35:55.257 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's good to know.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.215 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was there going to
be a procedure or an operation

00:35:59.215 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:84%
or something that didn't
happen or it was changed?

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.453 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's what it is.

00:36:02.453 --> 00:36:02.953 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:02.953 --> 00:36:03.582 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:03.582 --> 00:36:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
did the operation,

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.650 align:middle line:84%
but there was nothing
they could do.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't close
her up, and she died.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, there's
the conflict at the death.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.847 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was something
about the death that was weird.

00:36:12.847 --> 00:36:13.554 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:13.554 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:90%
That was weird.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:90%
That was weird.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It wasn't
fully finished or something.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And I was mad.

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.831 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, well
why did they go in.

00:36:21.831 --> 00:36:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:23.705 align:middle line:84%
When you said
conflict, I thought

00:36:23.705 --> 00:36:26.350 align:middle line:84%
you meant between Genevieve
and I. Like, we were fighting.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:90%
But there was none of that.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Not between siblings
or anything.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.075 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:30.075 --> 00:36:31.540 align:middle line:90%
And I-- yeah.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.539 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let
her tell you more.

00:36:35.539 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't
know what a bird means.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:37.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a bird.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:38.615 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A bird.

00:36:38.615 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
about the bird?

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:41.896 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, she does.

00:36:41.896 --> 00:36:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's a
crow in my backyard.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
full story, but yeah.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.243 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She influenced you
with the bird, with the crow.

00:36:51.243 --> 00:36:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She comes to me.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In the
sign of the bird.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.908 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:55.908 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's my
sister who's passed.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But my mom and I talked
to it many times.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, let's not
make it who it-- you know,

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.390 align:middle line:90%
we get the mother right now, so.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.098 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:03.098 --> 00:37:04.350 align:middle line:90%
So it must be my mother.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:90%
But yes, I understand the bird.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It could be both
of them coming through at once.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, there
are more than one bird.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
know I'm supposed

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:09.720 align:middle line:90%
to talk about the bird.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.595 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The bird.

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:11.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And anything
you want to finish up with?

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.900 align:middle line:90%


00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
the property's

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.440 align:middle line:90%
going somewhere else.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The property's
going somewhere else.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.521 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:37:24.521 --> 00:37:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.811 align:middle line:90%
Go give them a hug.

00:37:25.811 --> 00:37:33.229 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.229 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to come
over here to your mom, OK?

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Your mom, by the way, she
had something about her eyes.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And she's able to
see clearly now.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So I need to let
you know about that.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm also handing you
a bouquet of roses.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.435 align:middle line:90%
And-- I'm sorry.

00:37:45.435 --> 00:37:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Roses and carnations.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:90%
And carnations.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a big deal, flowers
are a very big deal.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:49.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I also need to ask you, in
your car, when you're driving,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.106 align:middle line:84%
she's standing right-- or
sitting right next to you.

00:37:54.106 --> 00:37:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you have something

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:90%
on the mirror that's of hers?

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.692 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:37:59.692 --> 00:38:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's a butterfly.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's a butterfly.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And don't you
associate that, that's

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:84%
hanging on that rear view
mirror, with your mother,

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.884 align:middle line:84%
or something about
the butterfly?

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A butterfly
has been my symbol

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:10.770 align:middle line:90%
since my mother passed away.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.806 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:38:11.806 --> 00:38:14.354 align:middle line:84%
So I want to acknowledge
that that butterfly that's

00:38:14.354 --> 00:38:16.270 align:middle line:84%
hanging there from that
mirror is your mother.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.970 align:middle line:90%
She's right there.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also want to
acknowledge with this lady--

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.488 align:middle line:84%
and is there another
Marie in the family?

00:38:20.488 --> 00:38:21.354 align:middle line:90%
Or Mary, or Maria.

00:38:21.354 --> 00:38:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All of us.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:90%
There's three girls.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.450 align:middle line:90%
We all are named Maria.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:90%
Different middle name.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:90%
My father's choice.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
father's choice.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.575 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was
more than one Maria.

00:38:29.575 --> 00:38:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that weird.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.571 align:middle line:84%
And I just know that
this-- she stopped

00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:35.820 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the flowers
and having a lot of flowers.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, wasn't there, with
her end of her life,

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:90%
wasn't there confusion?

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.829 align:middle line:84%
And was there-- was
there a wake, please?

00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: There was a--

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Or was there talk
about having a wake or not,

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.820 align:middle line:90%
or what?

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We were confused,
because we weren't-- she was

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:90%
in California.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.752 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to be buried with
my father, who lived in-- well,

00:38:51.752 --> 00:38:52.585 align:middle line:90%
was buried in Texas.

00:38:52.585 --> 00:38:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, I knew
there was going to be Texas.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And it was an
argument between the family.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Either cremation and send her
there, or send her body there.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really--
we were arguing a lot.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.432 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:39:04.432 --> 00:39:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I knew that.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And she's telling me about that.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We sent
her body there.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.052 align:middle line:90%
She knows about that.

00:39:09.052 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:84%
There was want-- someone
wanted to have a wake,

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and there was arguments among--
but she knows about that.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really
matter anymore.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
matter anymore.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
I know that in the
generations of the family

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.414 align:middle line:84%
there's a problem in the family
with-- go on-- with blood.

00:39:22.414 --> 00:39:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Blood problem in the family.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.395 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Circulation.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she
said the blood problems.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know there was a
problem with the grandmother

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.313 align:middle line:84%
or something, where
she couldn't walk,

00:39:29.313 --> 00:39:30.892 align:middle line:90%
or she had trouble getting up.

00:39:30.892 --> 00:39:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her mother.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Her mother, right?

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Your grandmother.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So there would be
trouble with walking,

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
because she's telling
me that very much.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.456 align:middle line:84%
She's with her mother
there, and she's

00:39:36.456 --> 00:39:37.810 align:middle line:90%
with other sisters over there.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Gotta tell you that as well.

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the family,
had something

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.287 align:middle line:84%
to do with the brain, or
on aneurysm, or something

00:39:42.287 --> 00:39:42.870 align:middle line:90%
with the head.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: When was it?

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.856 align:middle line:84%
Two days ago, my son
was in a hospital.

00:39:45.856 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:84%
They were checking
him for an aneurysm.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:47.885 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh.

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:48.384 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:48.384 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.765 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's-- I just
got that feeling.

00:39:51.765 --> 00:39:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel he's-- I don't
think you have anything

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:54.840 align:middle line:90%
to worry about there.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm
getting told that.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about who
just bought the new shoes.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And who bought a brand
new pair of shoes.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] Me.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yesterday.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
mom was influencing you

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:90%
with getting that pair of shoes.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Because she loved
her shoes, too,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and she's dancing, by the way.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.146 align:middle line:84%
So she's dancing,
having a good time.

00:40:11.146 --> 00:40:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
she said party.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.300 align:middle line:90%
She likes to party.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:13.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.216 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I've
got to tell you that.

00:40:15.216 --> 00:40:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I also must tell you that she
looks to the stars with you.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.310 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at the
stars and you're talking to her.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you that I
know mom and your dad both,

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.805 align:middle line:84%
but I feel connection
with your mother.

00:40:26.805 --> 00:40:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With you.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
was my best friend.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:29.928 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't feel as
tight with the father per se.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:33.745 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I feel
more with the mother.

00:40:33.745 --> 00:40:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I don't
know if the father remarried

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
or there's a whole
problem with that.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.045 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:40:38.045 --> 00:40:40.230 align:middle line:90%
My father died 20 years ago.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:90%
My mom died three years ago.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.516 align:middle line:84%
Because I just feel
the father-- I'm

00:40:43.516 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:84%
not as connected with the
father as I am with your mom.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that she's
calling you a sweetheart.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And the word she's
using is sweetheart.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's
either a bracelet,

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.988 align:middle line:84%
or there's something I'm
being shown in my mind

00:40:53.988 --> 00:40:57.554 align:middle line:84%
here with two hearts
coming together as one.

00:40:57.554 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I bought three necklaces when
she passed, and each of us

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.002 align:middle line:90%
have one.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:03.585 align:middle line:90%
Her daughters.

00:41:03.585 --> 00:41:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's
a heart, right?

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:04.900 align:middle line:90%
There's a heart?

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Two hearts,
coming together.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.544 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:41:06.544 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Because I know that.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.506 align:middle line:84%
And she-- I know
that to be true.

00:41:09.506 --> 00:41:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Cuz
I bought it for--

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
really, really important

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that you hear that, that
you acknowledge that.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you that
there's no pain with this lady.

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.551 align:middle line:90%
She's very happy where she's at.

00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying-- now
this is very interesting.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.130 align:middle line:84%
She's using the reference,
I'm in my father's kingdom.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me this lady might
have been a religious lady.

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And with
a Bible, because she's

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.660 align:middle line:90%
holding on to a Bible now.

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.161 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She died
with a rosary on her bed.

00:41:32.161 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just tell
you what I'm getting.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I know religious, it's a
symbolic for religious with me.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my father's kingdom.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm
with all the angels.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Hold on, got you.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:90%
She's very pushy.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.616 align:middle line:84%
Very enthusiastic
and very pushy.

00:41:44.616 --> 00:41:47.115 align:middle line:84%
But that's OK, because this'll
help somebody who's watching,

00:41:47.115 --> 00:41:48.390 align:middle line:90%
and people here.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:90%
That angels are significant.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.025 align:middle line:84%
You understand about the
angels being significant?

00:41:53.025 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
your mother loved angels.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I know that you love
angels, for your mother.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have lots
of figurines of angels.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I know you have shelves
of them, actually.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, mm-hm.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know if
I'm sitting in your couch,

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I can look and see angels.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know your mother's
photograph, or picture,

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
is lying right
there, and there's

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.505 align:middle line:84%
angel statues or
angels around it.

00:42:09.505 --> 00:42:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.505 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's very happy.

00:42:10.505 --> 00:42:12.104 align:middle line:90%
You have her earring, she said.

00:42:12.104 --> 00:42:13.020 align:middle line:90%
You have her earrings.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.070 align:middle line:90%
More than one, of course.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.696 align:middle line:84%
But I know the name Rose
is also significant.

00:42:16.696 --> 00:42:17.945 align:middle line:90%
So I know Rose is significant.

00:42:17.945 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My father
grew red roses for her.

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.042 align:middle line:84%
He would pick one
every day for her.

00:42:23.042 --> 00:42:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.416 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm seeing the rose, and
I know that's very significant.

00:42:26.416 --> 00:42:29.075 align:middle line:84%
So in your life, when you
smell, you smell the roses,

00:42:29.075 --> 00:42:30.610 align:middle line:90%
know that your mom is there.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.830 align:middle line:90%
And your father's there, too.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Your father looks after you
like you wouldn't believe.

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And there's one more thing.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you have
a child, or two children,

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:90%
but-- OK.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to write
something to them.

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:43.917 align:middle line:84%
So would you go home
maybe not today,

00:42:43.917 --> 00:42:46.000 align:middle line:84%
[SIGH] I'm getting very
emotional here as your mom

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.574 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:42:46.574 --> 00:42:48.240 align:middle line:84%
She's tough, too, you
know, your mother.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.031 align:middle line:84%
She can be really tough
if she wants to be.

00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, would you please
give the babies, your kids,

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:90%
a message from me?

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.849 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to come through
your hands in writing.

00:42:55.849 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's how she's going
to use the mediumship.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So mediumship comes
in different ways,

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and inspirational
writing is another way

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.290 align:middle line:90%
that spirit can influence you.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So please, when you feel
right, go home, have a pad,

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.700 align:middle line:84%
connect with your mother, your
father, and just be open to it

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and just let your
hand-- let them

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
take your hand over
and glide that pen.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And let her write-- it's
either a prayer, a poem,

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.410 align:middle line:90%
a message to your kids.

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.745 align:middle line:90%
She said she wants to do that.

00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I give
you all my love, she said.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.150 align:middle line:90%
My time is up.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.875 align:middle line:90%
My time is up.

00:43:21.875 --> 00:43:22.375 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave with that.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:23.949 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:23.949 --> 00:43:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Can I hug you?

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.626 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:25.626 --> 00:43:27.459 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to thank you all
very, very much for being here,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.650 align:middle line:90%
and everyone watching as well.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to be
reassured from today's show

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that, indeed, everybody's
mediumistic in their own way.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
perfect this skill,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.560 align:middle line:84%
you have to learn to
listen to the silence

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and be empowered with who you
are as a loving, gentle spirit.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Until we meet again, my love,
my light I send to all of you

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and all of you.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.400 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.950 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:44:09.046 align:middle line:90%
