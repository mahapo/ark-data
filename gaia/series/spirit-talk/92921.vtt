renowned spirit medium James

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also
very much for tuning in

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.767 align:middle line:84%
to "Spirit Talk," where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And today we have a
very special show today,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because today we're going to
talk about the subject which

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.590 align:middle line:90%
is very, very interesting to me.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
I find it very fascinating.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Many of you know that the
measurement of the world

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is based upon energy,
energy being molecules that

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:84%
vibrate or move at a
certain rate of speed.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything is energy,
everything is vibration.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And many people have asked
me over the years, what

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.402 align:middle line:84%
do you do besides meditation
to tune in to the energy?

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, well, there will
be different types of things

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:90%
you can use.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.975 align:middle line:90%
For instance, the crystal balls.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You use a crystal
ball, you can tune in

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
to the crystal ball
using that as a tool.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:84%
The Ouija board is another
tool if used correctly.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:90%
You can use a dowsing rod.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You can use
handwriting analysis.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:84%
You can use many different
types of methods or tools

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
in order to get into the
truth to recognize the energy.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So today's show, we
are going to specialize

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:90%
in what's called numerology.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have brought with me
one of the top in the world

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.430 align:middle line:90%
numerologists.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to join us
today and have a wonderful show

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
all about numbers and the
measurement of numbers.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.015 align:middle line:84%
So please help me welcome the
world renowned Glynis McCants.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:40.835 align:middle line:90%
Glynis?

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:41.793 align:middle line:90%
>>GLYNIS MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:01:41.793 --> 00:01:42.437 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Please
step on my stage.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: All right.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Have a seat.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.685 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I'm going
to get this chair.

00:01:47.685 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Hi, guys.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.729 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, Glynis.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.395 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: For people that
know nothing about numerology

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:84%
at all, which a lot of people
do not know, tell us first,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
well, what is a numerologist
and what is numerology?

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, numerology
is a science of numbers.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:90%
It is 2,500 years old.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And Pythagoras was the
creator of the system.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the system I use.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.056 align:middle line:90%
There's more than one.

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:84%
And the belief was that
everything in the universe

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.371 align:middle line:84%
has vibration, but
especially people.

00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when you meet
someone you're like, ooh,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.772 align:middle line:90%
I like this person.

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Or you meet someone, say, OK.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm tired.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel a little depressed.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you kill that person?

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can we
all relate to that?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.984 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
There are some audience
members I really like.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Others I just can't.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.175 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Oh,
it's just so true.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say
that's heartbreaking

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:90%
unless you have this tool.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I simplified this with my
books, "Glynis Has Your Number,"

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:90%
"Love by the Numbers."

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
What I did was help you
be able to break down

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:90%
people in your life.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
hold on one second.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.739 align:middle line:84%
So if I look at somebody
or I go into a certain,

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in a space,
like a location,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.069 align:middle line:90%
and everything has energy.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm either looking
at that person,

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.149 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the
energy on one level,

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying to me also
that that person's energy,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a number that
corresponds with that energy.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that
you're picking that up.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: It goes like this.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.984 align:middle line:84%
There's three
numbers in the name

00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
that a person goes
by, first and last.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let me get
this slowly so I know,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:90%
because I'm very slow.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Is your
show that long though?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.243 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, it is.

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:02.851 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Here we
go, grasshopper.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.715 align:middle line:90%
You got three in your name.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Three in your name.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.006 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And three
numbers in your birthday.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And those six numbers give
you a numerology blueprint

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:90%
of who a person is.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that, you're
able to do chart comparisons

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.284 align:middle line:84%
to see how you do
with other people.

00:03:19.284 --> 00:03:21.325 align:middle line:84%
Because then you find out
where are we compatible

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:22.742 align:middle line:90%
and where are we different?

00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
With that kind of
knowledge, you actually

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:90%
could get along with anybody.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.144 align:middle line:84%
If someone is toxic to you,
if you have the inside line,

00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:30.226 align:middle line:84%
you're going to know how
to communicate with them.

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:90%
And then you do OK.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.807 align:middle line:90%
You can handle it.

00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I teach it.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
there are people

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.340 align:middle line:84%
in your life that-- there are
toxic people in your life,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Absolutely.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Obviously.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And to stay away from them.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:90%
And let me ask you this.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody's a
numerologist like you are.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Right.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.199 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And not
everybody can really

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:90%
add numbers like you can.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I've seen you.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
You're like a
regular calculator.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But is there some way that
they can just meet a person,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.165 align:middle line:84%
and just maybe they
give their first name.

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:51.895 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way they can read
them in a numerical way?

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How
do you do that?

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.798 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: There's a
fun thing we can do.

00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
We can do this with
the audience today.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:84%
The first vowel
in your first name

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
tells me something about you.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.483 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
true for all of you.

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:02.922 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from A, E, I, O, U.

00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Which are all--

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: All
are vowels, right?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: One,
two, three, four?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Right.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'll do you.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes Y. Remember
they talk about that?

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Y becomes a vowel when it's
between two consonants.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Like my name, Glynis?

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: G-L-Y-N-I-S?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.756 align:middle line:84%
Because that Y is between
L and N, it is a vowel.

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:90%
So I would count it.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Now each letter has a number.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:90%
So A is one, E is five.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Each one.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.772 align:middle line:90%
O is six.

00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:90%
So we could keep going.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But let's play with your
audience a little bit

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:90%
on this one.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
do my name first.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Of course
I'm doing you, darling.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm not going
to do him first.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.555 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:37.055 align:middle line:90%
James.

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:39.325 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
J-A-M-E-S. And J would be--

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: A would
be your vowel.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.533 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A. OK.

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And A is
one, which means all

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.387 align:middle line:90%
about being number one.

00:04:44.387 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you
want the first vowel.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:90%
You want J-A.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, the
first vowel in your name.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's a one.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: In your case, yes.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And A means striving
to be the best at what you do.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.423 align:middle line:90%
You're very self-critical.

00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you feel
like you come up short,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%
you beat yourself up.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
You could do a great job,
one thing goes wrong,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're kind of
haunted by that one thing.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: True.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I'm sure you've
worked through stuff like that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:90%
because that's who you are.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing about
your name, James, J-A

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:90%
means double one.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
No matter how good,
not good enough.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:90%
So you actually-- whoa.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Your standards are high.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I mean, you
are running a serious--

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's true.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You're
running a serious race.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's true.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Right?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
As so it's like
you reach the goal,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.046 align:middle line:90%
and you go, OK, what's next?

00:05:19.046 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very true.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: It's very hard
for you to just relax.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very true.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And of course
with someone like that,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend
yoga, meditation,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:90%
anything to just calm it down.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I run.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.925 align:middle line:84%
So let's just do quickies of
someone who doesn't have an A,

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:90%
but how about E?

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, but
let me just ask you this.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So the first name is just
the first vowel in that name

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at?

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Well, yeah.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:90%
But you'll see the example.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
If I said E with
someone like Elaine,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I would explain that energy.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to do any of that?

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sure.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:90%
E is five.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone have an E
as their first vowel?

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Jennifer.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Jennifer.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So Jennifer with the E, E means
natural detective, digging

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.001 align:middle line:84%
for truth, you can't
stand not knowing.

00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
If you feel like
you're in the dark,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do
whatever it takes

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to find out what
really happened.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So I actually feel
sorry for people

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.251 align:middle line:84%
who lie to you, because
you always get the truth.

00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:01.389 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:02.430 align:middle line:90%
How true is that for you?

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Natural lie detector.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Now note this.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:90%
That's all from her name.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Just Jennifer, just a vowel.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:90%
So see how fun that is?

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's great.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So instead of
doing the full blown research

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.617 align:middle line:84%
of numerology, which
I would encourage,

00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:90%
you can do it that quickly, too.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Just make a note of, uh oh.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Jennifer, don't
mess with Jennifer.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:84%
She's going to find
out what would happen.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But it also means
celebrator of life.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
You love to go to the party.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait to be
there, and you're a giver.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.180 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
When you give to someone,
you're so excited to see them.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You're
revealing way too much.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, I know.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But when you give something, you
can't wait to see the response.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Like, you love to give.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even as
comfortable when you receive.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ooh.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.694 align:middle line:90%
What do I owe you?

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: There it is.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Just from Jennifer.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So someone
will say to me, well,

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.056 align:middle line:84%
that was a psychic
reading you just did.

00:06:42.056 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, but I would say
to you, anyone in your audience

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
already knows we're all psychic.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
That's so silly
to me when people

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:90%
try to mock the word psychic.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.074 align:middle line:90%
Stop your nonsense.

00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:84%
If the phone rings, you
were thinking of your friend

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's your friend,
that is psychic.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's psyche.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.226 align:middle line:84%
But for me, we have
tools like you.

00:06:59.226 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:90%
When you're reading--

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.731 align:middle line:90%
Look, I saw you with astrology.

00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:90%
This guy's dangerous.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
When you've got your
tools, you're ridiculous.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And you just start going.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So we find tools that
open the third eye.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
But we all have a
natural psychic ability.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Some of us fine hone it.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
When I do numerology, my
third eyes is wide open.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:90%
You can run, but you can't hide.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, and she's
also a very, very good healer.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Amazing healer,
amazing intuitive.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I've seen her work.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.171 align:middle line:84%
How she gets into the
numbers and then just

00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:25.626 align:middle line:84%
goes right into the real strong
clairvoyance, very strong.

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:90%
What about one more person?

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:90%
You want to do their name?

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: How about an I?

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Someone who is-- vowel.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What's your name?

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, Gina.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.341 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Gina.

00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: That was adorable.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:84%
She was just going
to stare at you.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.956 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So Gina.

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:36.345 align:middle line:90%

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.628 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
between these two over here

00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
in the audience,
I'm not sure yet.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know
where she is, and she

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know her first
name, so a little scary.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.884 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So Gina.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Gina, the I is nine,
and that often means issues

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:90%
from the original family.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, growing up you were like
an old soul as a little kid,

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:90%
beyond your years.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And you actually have to find
a way to let go of the past

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.905 align:middle line:90%
so you can be happy today.

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Because when something's
bothering you,

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
it's really hard to let it go.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.431 align:middle line:90%
It lives in your head.

00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when you find
ways to be in the moment,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:90%
you are way past happy.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't remember
your name, evidently.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.852 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:10.852 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But otherwise,
really, it's a gift.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.768 align:middle line:84%
And it also means
people assume you

00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:15.951 align:middle line:84%
know what's going on even
when you have no clue.

00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:90%
So they count on you to do.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, OK, I
don't want to let them down,

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:90%
so you come through for them.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's amazing.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: A vowel.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Amazing.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're very psychic,
you're very, very intuitive.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.416 align:middle line:90%
You're very intuitive.

00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't trust it, but
you're very intuitive.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.468 align:middle line:84%
Have you been told
that before now?

00:08:31.468 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A couple times,
but I'm just-- I'm learning.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You are.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
How about one more, then
we'll do a little meditation?

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:90%
So A-- OK.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.084 align:middle line:84%
We've got A, E, I,
O. Who's got the O?

00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You've
got to be an O. No?

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.615 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I, actually.

00:08:42.615 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.529 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:90%
U?

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Who's got a U?

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.737 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Jude.

00:08:46.737 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Spell it.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: J-U-D-E.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: The U
actually loves to laugh.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny you
look so serious.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:90%
Now she's giggling.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's got
a good sense of humor.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You can have
the most serious face.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.526 align:middle line:84%
But if something's funny,
you're on the floor.

00:08:58.526 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:90%
You are.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:90%
You're ridiculous.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%
And you love the gossip.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
If you got the scoop it's
like, what do you know?

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Fill me in.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what's really going on.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And the U often has a laugh.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think of Julia
Roberts, because she's

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
known for that laugh.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Especially in the
ad lib moments you

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
hear her where she
laughs so sincerely.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Your laugh makes people
want to be funny around you.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.339 align:middle line:90%
How true is that?

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:21.338 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:09:21.338 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: I feel better.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I will keep this day job.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know Jude,
and that's very accurate.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.016 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, great.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now I want to
talk a little bit about-- first,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
anybody have questions
so far about numerology?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:90%
You have a question, love.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.785 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So my
name's Lynda with a Y.

00:09:34.785 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I always
say that's because that

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.855 align:middle line:90%
was my first word, why.

00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Now that does make a big
difference by the way.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Because Lynda with the Y,
that means of course everyone

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:90%
misspells your name.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: So who gave you that?

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mom.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.883 align:middle line:84%
So your mom, you know,
she's a troublemaker.

00:09:49.883 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:90%
And I say that with love.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Honestly.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.097 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who messes
with a normal name,

00:09:55.097 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
spells it a little different,
it's going to mess you up.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And you're constantly going,
actually, it's with a Y.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So you constantly have to
say, it's actually with a Y,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:90%
because you automatically go I.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Now here's what's
good about it for you.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Y is seven, which
is spirituality.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.346 align:middle line:84%
So even though you can be
social, you're also a loner.

00:10:10.346 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:90%
You need to be by yourself.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.226 align:middle line:84%
And you observe and
hear everything.

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you're the one who
walks around going, who am I?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And nature's beauty
speaks to you.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, mountains, plants,
flowers speaks to your soul.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
If it's a good
sunset, you're glued.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wow.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.766 align:middle line:90%
So you're really an observer.

00:10:28.766 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what
your other numerology

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.144 align:middle line:84%
is that might point to other
things, that's your soul.

00:10:33.144 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's about spirituality.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you find your real
base of faith to believe in,

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
very content with that.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Have you found it yet?

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I really feel I have.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And when
did you find it?

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: When I was a child.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.193 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: OK, so you've
had it a long time,

00:10:47.193 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:90%
which is a huge blessing.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But do you journal at
all, write things down?

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: That's huge
for you, because you

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:90%
have to clear your mind.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
You think way too much.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Hard to let it go.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, your mind is clutter.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you just
purge it to paper,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
you're going to feel better.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Purge it to paper.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:00.915 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:01.505 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I love that.

00:11:01.505 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Purge it to paper.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I love that.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Purge it to paper.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Purge it to paper.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I love that.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very, very good.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be great
if we did-- everybody knows

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
about "everything
is energy" and you

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
can read people based
upon the numbers.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But also
I find with my work

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that I do I'm able to
talk to dead people.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:90%
That's easy for me.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The hard part is when I see
some people come to a group

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and they bring with them
all of their past history,

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
all of their expectations,
all their belief systems,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:84%
other people's energy there,
other people's energy who's

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
sitting in their space,
causing toxicity,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
causing a sense of limitation,
causing a sense of fear.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.566 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's our
responsibility every day

00:11:38.566 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings having an
experience to really cleanse

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.269 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and really come
from a space of the heart.

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Every day I think
we need to do that.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We take showers every
day, or baths every day.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:90%
At least I hope some of you do.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:90%
I would know.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:90%
I could smell you.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So I know that we're
concerned about

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.000 align:middle line:84%
our cleanliness with
our physical body,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:90%
but what about our spirit body?

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to bring us-- and
you understand that, of course.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Of course.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
maybe we'd would

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.566 align:middle line:84%
do something with--
could you talk

00:12:06.566 --> 00:12:07.747 align:middle line:90%
about vibrations and energy?

00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, here's what I
would tell you about vibration.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we all deal with
humans and some of them

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
are toxic to us, their
toxicness gets on us,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
so we have to clear the space.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
meditations, you're

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:90%
protecting yourself again.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I call it a white
light of protection.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So that no matter
who comes around you,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.419 align:middle line:90%
they can't hurt you.

00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what goes wrong.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
You could be in a great
mood, but if toxic energy

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:90%
comes around, they depress you.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.744 align:middle line:90%
You suddenly feel sad.

00:12:32.744 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, they just put their
stuff on you, didn't they?

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's true.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.125 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So when you do
this clearing of meditation,

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
you're giving them the
purity of themselves

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:84%
again so that they can be in the
moment and learn today from us.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you're going
to have your seat back there

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.415 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go
lead a meditation

00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and I'll bring you back up.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Is that all right?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, darling.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, doll.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You look
handsome in the suit.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't we going
to acknowledge this?

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
you look gorgeous too.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: You do.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We've known
each other many, many years.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
can tell, right?

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like brother
and sister here.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you're going to sit
in your chair down there.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Good, get off the stage.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Oh, you
mean not there?

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Get--

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Wait, you
want me to do what?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Back
down to the chair.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Off the stage?

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.196 align:middle line:90%
This is hurtful.

00:13:06.196 --> 00:13:07.224 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:07.224 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
What did I say
about toxic energy?

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.723 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, just go.

00:13:09.723 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: I'm now depressed.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.385 align:middle line:90%
I have to clear my space.

00:13:12.385 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Thrown off the stage.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.257 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's a Leo.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.923 align:middle line:90%
Loves showbiz.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Spotlight.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, then.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.971 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is just going to be
a way to clear your space,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.431 align:middle line:84%
to clear your energy
around you, and really

00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
clear the sense of, if you
will, the mind attacks.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.844 align:middle line:90%
I call them mind attacks.

00:13:33.844 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:84%
From other people
thinking of you,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.093 align:middle line:84%
what you come into this
space with carrying,

00:13:37.093 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
other people's thoughts on you,
other people's energy on you.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So anyone you talk
on the phone today,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
talked on the phone
yesterday, you still

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:90%
have their energy on you.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people think, if
they just think a white light,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:90%
that'll be it.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Because white light is
a wonderful deterrent

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.476 align:middle line:84%
for keeping energy out, but
it also keeps things in.

00:13:53.476 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make sure,
before you put that white light

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.649 align:middle line:84%
around you that you've
cleansed your space

00:13:57.649 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and that you're very much in
your center of your being.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to guide you
through a little meditation.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
going to, because we

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
talked about vibration today
with Glynis and numerology

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.291 align:middle line:84%
and vibration, we're going
to do a little bit of toning

00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go through
a series of exercises

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
where you will
visualize bringing

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the toxic energy,
the foreign energy, away

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
from your space using
Mother Earth, who

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful energy
of-- nurturing energy

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.236 align:middle line:84%
who will take energy and
really recycle it to love.

00:14:24.236 --> 00:14:25.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what she does.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.575 align:middle line:84%
That's what Mother Earth
does, and nurtures us.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go back
and cleanse our space,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll bring ourselves
in a perfect level of tone

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and then receive the
inspiration from Glynis

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.795 align:middle line:90%
and myself in the spirit world.

00:14:36.795 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Is that good?

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.875 align:middle line:90%
So just close your eyes.

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Just close your eyes
and just give yourself

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
a couple of moments
to be with yourself.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:90%
We worry so much about the past.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:90%
The past has already happened.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:90%
The future is yet to be.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.795 align:middle line:84%
So all we truly have
is this moment now.

00:14:55.795 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you
to imagine yourself

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.875 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
of your own creation.

00:15:02.875 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
The flowers and trees,
daffodils and roses and lilacs,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
lilies, sycamores,
birches, any kind of trees,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.779 align:middle line:84%
flowers, gardens you'd like
envision in your mind's eye.

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:21.945 align:middle line:84%
And become aware that this
is your spiritual garden.

00:15:21.945 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And as you go in your mind
to this spiritual garden,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.200 align:middle line:90%
you hear music behind my voice.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.750 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go in the
middle of this green field.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of
this green meadow

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
is reserved just for you,
just for your healing

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and just for you to bring
balance back to your bodies.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Get back into your
sense of self.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So as we breathe,
we're going to imagine

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful golden
light coming down

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:84%
within us through the top of
the head all through the body.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we exhale
out of the mouth,

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to let go of any
old energies we've been holding

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
onto, any old thoughtful
forms, any old limitations,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
any old negative thoughts,
other people's energy.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Anything which does not
encourage our growth,

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:90%
we're going to release that.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So together let's inhale
that beautiful golden light,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:90%
and inhale.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
just energy coming out

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
of your mouth, your hands.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.715 align:middle line:84%
Just going back to Mother
Earth, recycle to love.

00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:90%
And again, and inhale.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.683 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:16:45.683 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.547 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:16:47.547 --> 00:16:48.541 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And one more time, and inhale.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Illumination,
illumination, illumination.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
for four, and exhale.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand
there in that field,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful
green field, I would

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
like for you to
imagine now that there

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit of a little
vacuum, a tiny little vacuum,

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and the tube goes right
down to Mother Earth.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to use that
vacuum with your imagination

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and vacuum away, from
the top of your head

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:84%
going down the back, any
energies of other people,

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.366 align:middle line:84%
any old thought forms
of other people,

00:17:28.366 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
going down through
the head area,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
taking away, vacuuming
away any energies which

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
are sitting there in your
space which do not belong.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.035 align:middle line:84%
You vacuum your shoulders,
your lower back,

00:17:42.035 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the top of the back,
and then the lower back.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And you might begin to see
actual fragments or faces go

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
into this tube down to Mother
Earth to recycle to love.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Just notice how you feel as you
vacuum away these energies down

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
the back, around the
hips, down your legs.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Feel the lightness
which you feel,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.110 align:middle line:84%
which you become aware of as
you take away those heavier,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:90%
dense energies.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And now in front of you, start
with the third eye center.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Any energies, any
psychic debris that

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
is sitting there which
does not belong to you,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.410 align:middle line:84%
You can just wipe away
that hole, that leak,

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:84%
and it goes right
back to itself.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.545 align:middle line:90%
Goes right back, connection.

All right.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Let me say what I do and why
I think numerology's great

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
is that when you
simplify, you're

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:90%
able to apply it to your life.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do
some quick reads

such thing as a stranger when

break down names.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.261 align:middle line:84%
If someone lies to you,
it's like, I really

00:24:17.261 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
can't know you because
not I'm really hurt.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like, all you had to
do was tell me the truth.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Because even if it's a bad
truth, you're still OK.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just, you just
need them to be honest.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's a biggie.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And then eight means I
don't mind working hard,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.120 align:middle line:90%
but where's my paycheck?

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.724 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:31.724 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: OK, so
you need your money.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.084 align:middle line:84%
And my lesson for you would
be, be careful with your words.

00:24:37.084 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You're very honest,
but you've got

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:90%
to be careful how you say it.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when they misunderstand
you, you feel bad.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wow.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I was only telling the truth,
but now they're upset with me.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.170 align:middle line:90%
How often does that happen?

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not often.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And who does it
happen with when it does?

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Family?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.472 align:middle line:90%
What is your family?

00:24:56.472 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Kids, what do you have?

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.305 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
two daughters.

00:24:58.305 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Do they
never misinterpret you?

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They do.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Thank you.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:90%
That's all I'm saying.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let
me ask a question.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:03.910 align:middle line:90%
We'll do this.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:90%
You just did Laura.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.640 align:middle line:84%
You did her name, or the numbers
to her-- letters of her name.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you brought
it down to one single letter--

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:09.739 align:middle line:90%
number which is--

00:25:09.739 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: A.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Three
is the attitude,

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and you have a 4 is the--

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.504 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:25:13.504 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, the day she
was born, 26, 2 plus 6 is 8.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And then month and day, 04/26,
when you break it down to one

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
digit, it's a 3.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you took her full
date of birth, 04/26/1963,

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.287 align:middle line:84%
add it all the way
across, it became a four.

00:25:27.287 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I see.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.927 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But what
I was saying is,

00:25:29.927 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
because she's got a 3,
which is natural counselor,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
it means you give
advice all the time.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.796 align:middle line:84%
But when it's not
listened to and you

00:25:34.796 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:84%
watch them make the mistake you
were trying to help them avoid,

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.487 align:middle line:90%
that bums you out.

00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But I know your kids
misinterpret you.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.235 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a 4 and not
sometimes feel misunderstood.

00:25:43.235 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And do you
have issues with your dad?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I would just

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:84%
add for you-- because I
know as I look at her.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I know she has issues
with her father.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a separation
between your father

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and your mother in
some way, and you never

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.123 align:middle line:84%
healed from that
relationship breakup.

00:25:54.123 --> 00:25:54.807 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:25:54.807 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And part of it
feels as if want--

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you might have thought I caused
that or if I did this to stop

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.134 align:middle line:90%
it, this wouldn't have happened.

00:26:01.134 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And I shouldn't.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.790 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It almost feels
like I'm responsible for it

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.191 align:middle line:84%
and I could've stopped
that from happening.

00:26:06.191 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Is your dad passed
over to the other side?

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's right to your
left, to the left side of you

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:84%
He has brown hair that I'm
seeing there right now.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Brown and very handsome man.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Brown is off to the side.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Is that with the side.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I have
a part right here

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to push my
hair over to the side.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.946 align:middle line:84%
I know that one of my kids
has a comb of mine still,

00:26:21.946 --> 00:26:23.470 align:middle line:84%
there'd be a comb
that still exists.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.045 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they tried
making him as nice as they

00:26:25.045 --> 00:26:26.840 align:middle line:84%
could at the end, but
no one could have.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And there's also an old train.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:90%
So he shows me an old train.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if he
worked on the trains

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
or had something to
do with old trains.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His father
worked on the railroad,

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
and he loved trains.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
as he was a young kid,

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
around 10 to 15 years of age,
he used to go on those trains

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know he used to work

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
for the father on
the trains in that.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what he did, but
his father gave him some coins.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So he must have done
something on those trains

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.883 align:middle line:90%
he would get money for it.

00:26:48.883 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:90%
He's met that man again.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And is there a sister
that you know out west?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Or is there a sister you have?

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it's
her birthday today.

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.375 align:middle line:84%
Because he wants to
give love to the sister.

00:26:56.375 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Very, very important.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.624 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a Robert
somewhere as well.

00:26:59.624 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who's that?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My cousin.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
your cousin Robert?

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.653 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
there's a Robert there.

00:27:04.653 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I know in the spirit world
that there's definitely--

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, and I'm sorry.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Robert--

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Robert's down here?

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Here on Earth.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:90%
There is another Robert.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Your father would know the
Robert in the spirit world.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're talking about.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You've seen him.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Some military
connection as well.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Got
to tell you that.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very important to your dad.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a military
connection to that.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't know if
you can see it in the chart,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
but there's definitely
some-- I feel on a soul level

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
as well, there's some
soul-- definitely some soul

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
lessons here, some karma if
you want to call it karma,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
some integration of family here.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.569 align:middle line:84%
And your own value
to that family,

00:27:35.569 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that people in that family don't
know you who you really are.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.391 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But that
comes from-- yes.

00:27:40.391 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Three, eight, four.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.395 align:middle line:90%
You always misinterpret it.

00:27:42.395 --> 00:27:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I just said, look,
she's adorable.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:90%
She looks like a student.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.783 align:middle line:84%
She looks like a
first grader, really.

00:27:46.783 --> 00:27:47.397 align:middle line:90%
Look at her.

00:27:47.397 --> 00:27:48.855 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's like
that perfect kid

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:50.521 align:middle line:84%
who came to school
with her perfect hair

00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and her perfect outfit.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.120 align:middle line:90%
That's very eight four.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to look bad.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:54.986 align:middle line:90%
It's depressing.

00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I want
to make an effort.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.997 align:middle line:84%
I say that all the
world's a stage, right?

00:27:58.997 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:90%
So why not make an effort?

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Why not at least
try to look good?

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And then going back
to hard lessons,

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.240 align:middle line:84%
you actually hit your
head before you learn.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.390 align:middle line:90%
That's how you learn.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And when someone tells you how
to do it, it's like, please.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.764 align:middle line:90%
Give me a chance here.

00:28:11.764 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like when they push you
into doing what you don't and

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.013 align:middle line:90%
then it falls apart.

00:28:15.013 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I can't believe
I let them have me do that.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.239 align:middle line:90%
So that's how she learns.

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:20.905 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
think also that it's

00:28:20.905 --> 00:28:22.446 align:middle line:84%
so interesting that
are no accidents.

00:28:22.446 --> 00:28:24.137 align:middle line:84%
There are no
accidents whatsoever.

00:28:24.137 --> 00:28:26.470 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing about that
meditation which we just did,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
which I've never
done here before,

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.650 align:middle line:84%
is all about letting
go of things.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.483 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been
holding onto your family

00:28:31.483 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:84%
stuff, your grandparents'
stuff, the family

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:84%
image, the family that
people think of you,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
what was not said
before they passed over.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.404 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to say this,
but I didn't say this.

00:28:40.404 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And I feel your
father passed away

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't say
what he wanted to say.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.083 align:middle line:84%
Your mother separated
from him, didn't

00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:46.264 align:middle line:90%
say what she wanted to say.

00:28:46.264 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Everybody that's in that family
tend to keep things aside.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Ah, but look how
precious those shoes are.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.060 align:middle line:90%
If that's not a little kid.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:90%
Are those not Mary Janes?

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Am I imagining it?

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.830 align:middle line:90%
What are those?

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's so interesting
that this is coming up.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.519 align:middle line:84%
Because I usually hang
out in my yoga pants.

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm barefoot.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, but here
you are dressed today.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm seeing the
little girl in you.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know that little girl
in you is alive and well.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And that comes
with your three attitude.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I
just want to play.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And that's when,
when life gets too intense,

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.520 align:middle line:84%
it's like, whoa,
where's a good song?

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Where's a good movie?

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.677 align:middle line:84%
You really appreciate
anything creative.

00:29:15.677 --> 00:29:16.343 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:16.343 --> 00:29:18.081 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But those
shoes are precious.

00:29:18.081 --> 00:29:19.830 align:middle line:84%
That's where I'm getting
that little girl.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:90%
I see her.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:90%
She showed up today.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just
want you to-- you

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
know that military picture
of your father that you have?

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take that out and
put it in a different place.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:28.271 align:middle line:90%
You just saw it recently.

00:29:28.271 --> 00:29:30.655 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to sit down
and write a letter to him.

00:29:30.655 --> 00:29:32.450 align:middle line:90%
And I want it all to come out.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Because there's some aspects
that have not been healed yet.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.560 align:middle line:84%
You might think they
have, but they haven't.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
then I want you

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.575 align:middle line:84%
to turn the page over and
write a letter from him to you.

00:29:39.575 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because he
has a lot to say to you.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.601 align:middle line:84%
It would take a
whole season of shows

00:29:42.601 --> 00:29:44.277 align:middle line:90%
to say what he wants to say.

00:29:44.277 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
be good on yourself.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't go around
life-- everybody--

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
you can't go around life holding
that energy within because it

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.182 align:middle line:90%
ends up being dis-eased.

00:29:53.182 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
You have to have an
easement of the flow.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And when there's an energy which
is resentment, anger, words

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that were not said, it
builds up that energy

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.304 align:middle line:84%
that dams up the
energy and the flow.

00:30:03.304 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want that because
it'll manifest physically.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So you need to get
that out, all right?

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.057 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:09.890 align:middle line:90%
You can applaud her.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:10.551 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:30:10.551 --> 00:30:13.406 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:13.406 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I have something very
interesting for you

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.763 align:middle line:84%
which you've probably
never done before, darling.

00:30:16.763 --> 00:30:17.116 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Really?

00:30:17.116 --> 00:30:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-mm.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.733 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: This
will be interesting.

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:19.659 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:19.659 --> 00:30:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So is it possible
that I could contact a spirit

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.015 align:middle line:84%
and you could do the
numbers of the spirit?

00:30:24.015 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well,
here's the deal.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:26.265 align:middle line:90%
I need birth numbers.

00:30:26.265 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Obviously her father passed.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.590 align:middle line:84%
If you can give
me those numbers.

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No, no, no.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.797 align:middle line:84%
But if I am able to
get through somebody--

00:30:30.797 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: No.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I would never make
up numbers on stage.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No,
no, no, no, no.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Listen, darling.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The person-- if I
was able to get someone through

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and the person knows
their mother's birthdays.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Of course.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I want
to talk to a mother that

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.206 align:middle line:90%
passed over right over here.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:42.262 align:middle line:90%
Your mom passed over?

00:30:42.262 --> 00:30:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing up, please?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That
might work better.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.525 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what is your name?

00:30:45.525 --> 00:30:46.941 align:middle line:84%
You have a hard
of hearing, so I'm

00:30:46.941 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
going try to be
as close as I can.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.366 align:middle line:90%
Your name?

00:30:50.366 --> 00:30:51.116 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Peter.

00:30:51.116 --> 00:30:51.949 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Peter.

00:30:51.949 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I know I have a mother here
very, very clearly coming

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.850 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:55.742 align:middle line:90%
Very, very clear.

00:30:55.742 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why she wants
to show me making the peanut

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.408 align:middle line:90%
butter and jelly sandwiches--

00:30:59.408 --> 00:31:00.002 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.002 --> 00:31:01.460 align:middle line:84%
--and she's cutting
off the edges--

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mom.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --because he
doesn't want to have the crust.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.310 align:middle line:84%
She's cutting off
the crust for you.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's why
she said, he'll know about that.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.165 align:middle line:90%
He'll know about that.

00:31:09.165 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know there
would have been,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:84%
when you were younger
as she comes to my mind,

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
she goes to a younger time
of life, much, much younger.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's a
much happier time.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:90%
I feel we're all together then.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.162 align:middle line:90%
We were all together then.

00:31:21.162 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And at one point it seems
like the whole family

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and then some relatives
also are living together.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.448 align:middle line:84%
So the whole family kind of
lives together in one compound.

00:31:27.448 --> 00:31:28.795 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:31:28.795 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And would you know about the
lake in front of the house?

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.423 align:middle line:90%
Or there was a lake.

00:31:33.423 --> 00:31:34.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you went to--

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I live on a river.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
live on a river?

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, she visits
you at that river.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.809 align:middle line:84%
Do you go fishing
sometimes at the river?

00:31:41.809 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All the time.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And if
I go to your house

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:84%
where you live right now, where
your mother's bringing my mind,

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.082 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to
three fishing rods.

00:31:49.082 --> 00:31:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Shows me one, two, three.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very aware of that.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware
also she says to me

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:90%
that you recently went in town.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.475 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:31:57.475 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.273 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:31:59.273 --> 00:32:01.692 align:middle line:84%
I need to let you know
there's a Mary somewhere.

In the spirit world

So you knew Mary.

00:32:09.654 --> 00:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I know that they would sit
together in the afternoon

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.157 align:middle line:90%
and have some chat, some chats.

00:32:13.157 --> 00:32:13.990 align:middle line:90%

>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I know your mother would
have had glasses at the time.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Glasses.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think I might be in the
late 1950s or early '60s.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I
have the glasses here

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.615 align:middle line:84%
and they go up to the
edge and the hair is back.

00:32:34.615 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I know Wednesdays would
have been a hair day.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.739 align:middle line:90%
Go to a hair day on Wednesday.

00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:39.057 align:middle line:90%

Thank you very much.

Well, I'll just-- I'll tell you.

00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you're
like night and day.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.630 align:middle line:90%
You're very different people.

You're like very
different people.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

A couple of things.

cards that she

00:35:39.983 --> 00:35:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: She did have eyes
behind the back of her head.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.570 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, because
she was born on a nine day,

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.910 align:middle line:84%
her family was not as
terrific as she would like.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Like as a mom, her parents.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
She tried to do it
better with you guys.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.947 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to be a good mom.

00:35:53.947 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She was.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.300 align:middle line:90%
But that's where it came from.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.110 align:middle line:84%
She was motivated
to do it right.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And then what's
your date of birth

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:90%
to your mother's date of birth?

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.097 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 9/19/53.

00:36:03.097 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And then
what is your first name?

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:05.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Peter.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.088 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You're
still Peter, huh?

00:36:07.088 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.730 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm
asking, I could have

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.294 align:middle line:84%
swore-- what was
your last name then.

00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Last name?

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:13.705 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Van Putten.

00:36:13.705 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK, yeah.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:90%
You never said that today.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:15.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.150 align:middle line:90%
That's fair.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought you said
your last name for the family

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
was Peter when we had the
mix up with the mom's name.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's OK.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.735 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: All right.

00:36:21.735 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:90%
One, nine.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you're
looking at his name now.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, I'm actually
looking at his birth numbers

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.020 align:middle line:90%
compared to his mom.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: One, OK.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:35.901 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that you--
your mom couldn't control you,

00:36:35.901 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:90%
You're very independent.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.330 align:middle line:84%
That double one energy, you
wanted to do it your way.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.932 align:middle line:84%
So when she tried to
control, it's like this.

00:36:42.932 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:84%
If I say go left and you
don't like the way I say it,

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:90%
you go right.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:90%
You do do that?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely true.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.166 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And then nine was
your attitude number,

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
so that was your
respect for her.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Like, you loved your mom,
but you needed freedom.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And there were times she
felt a little controlling.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that two attitude is
like, where are you're going?

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:00.560 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.601 align:middle line:90%
What's going on with you?

00:37:01.601 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Like, whoa.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.970 align:middle line:90%
I just need my time.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
tell you everything.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:08.979 align:middle line:84%
But the reason you would feel
so connected and miss her,

00:37:08.979 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:84%
you were actually
compatible in numerology.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.562 align:middle line:90%
You loved your mom.

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, you got a kick out of
her and you were actually

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:14.685 align:middle line:90%
proud of her.

00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, there were things
that you were proud of,

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.260 align:middle line:84%
but she had a lot to say,
and you couldn't shut her up.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Once she was upset--

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, oh forget it.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.361 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You could
not shut her up.

00:37:22.361 --> 00:37:22.862 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:22.862 --> 00:37:24.777 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're having
trouble with hearing.

00:37:24.777 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I can't
listen to all of this.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.511 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
can't hear all of it.

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.473 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:28.473 --> 00:37:29.435 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving up.

00:37:29.435 --> 00:37:31.082 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Count on it.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I promise you, that
shuts down the ears.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:36.599 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, but that's how it works.

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:37.390 align:middle line:90%
That's how it goes.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.889 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very good.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.633 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:41.633 --> 00:37:42.132 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:42.132 --> 00:37:43.950 align:middle line:90%
We can go to someone else.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:45.945 align:middle line:84%
That's very
interesting isn't it?

00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very interesting.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.144 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk over here about
a gentleman that passes over.

00:37:50.144 --> 00:37:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I have a
father figure on this side.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a father or
a father-in-law feeling.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.096 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go in
this area over here.

00:37:56.096 --> 00:37:58.169 align:middle line:84%
Which one lost a father
or father-in-law?

00:37:58.169 --> 00:37:58.710 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.280 align:middle line:90%
You.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:37:59.779 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:59.779 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Is that possible
I can come to you?

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, would
you mind standing?

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
name, sweetheart?

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Karen.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Karen.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Karen, this would be your
dad, then, that passed over?

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.728 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:09.728 --> 00:38:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And would there be
a lady over there

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.306 align:middle line:84%
with, like, a mother-in-law
or another-- a mother

00:38:14.306 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
or a sister of his on
the other side as well?

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.085 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sister and mother.

00:38:17.085 --> 00:38:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.150 align:middle line:90%
Sister and mother.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that as
I come in with this man

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:84%
here on his level, there's a
woman who would know of him

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.520 align:middle line:84%
and who grew up with
him and knows of him.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: His sister.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.625 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I also want
to ask who Steven might be,

00:38:27.625 --> 00:38:28.462 align:middle line:90%
or a Steve.

00:38:28.462 --> 00:38:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your husband.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.468 align:middle line:84%
So that lady over
on the other side

00:38:31.468 --> 00:38:33.066 align:middle line:84%
here is talking about
Steven or Steve.

00:38:33.066 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And he's still down here
on the earth, Steve?

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So this lady in the
spirit world, his mother,

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.126 align:middle line:84%
must have passed
over, is that right?

00:38:39.126 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not his mother.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
so his grandmother?

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad's
mother's over there.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your dad's mother.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.320 align:middle line:90%
This would be connected to him.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it's his
grandmother on the mother's

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.645 align:middle line:90%
side of the family.

00:38:47.645 --> 00:38:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:90%
She's married to a Steven.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, so listen carefully.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:57.455 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the grandmother
of your husband's mother.

00:38:57.455 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.974 align:middle line:84%
So she's already passed
to the other side of life.

00:39:00.974 --> 00:39:02.056 align:middle line:90%
She's in the spirit world.

00:39:02.056 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:90%
You didn't know her.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, I did not.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.443 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going to have
to give a message to Steven

00:39:06.443 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:90%
that she's saying hello.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.891 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to
talk about somebody who's

00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:13.590 align:middle line:84%
addicted to drugs or had
drug problems at one point.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was that him, or
was that someone in the family?

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
someone in the family.

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is it
one of your siblings?

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who is it?

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's my
mother's brother.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did
that person pass over?

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:23.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Had trouble with
drugs, drinking?

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.607 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:26.607 --> 00:39:27.315 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:27.315 --> 00:39:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you having problems
walking-- hold on.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.692 align:middle line:84%
Are you having problems--
go on, slow down.

00:39:31.692 --> 00:39:33.358 align:middle line:84%
Your father's trying
to come in and he's

00:39:33.358 --> 00:39:34.752 align:middle line:90%
trying to explain himself to me.

00:39:34.752 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Your father's a
very mental person.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:90%
He's very black and white.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.450 align:middle line:84%
He likes things with facts
and details, your father.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:39.775 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:39.775 --> 00:39:40.483 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:39:40.483 --> 00:39:42.430 align:middle line:84%
But he's not a very
warm person, OK?

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:43.485 align:middle line:90%
He cannot emote well.

00:39:43.485 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he was not
able to show his emotions when

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.880 align:middle line:84%
he was-- when you were
growing up with him.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you, the
feel's like in some ways, oh,

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
these kids, they had
to happen, you know?

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry to
say that, but I have

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring through the
energy of this man--

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's fine.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.851 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --and that he's
coming in for this healing for.

00:39:58.851 --> 00:40:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But I get a strong, strong sense
that he didn't know any better.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know any better.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I feel this man
was brutalized when

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.560 align:middle line:84%
he was a young
kid by his father.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you might
have heard stories about that.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But it's
really, really strong.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:90%
So I know there's abuse there.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't get him and
your mother together at all,

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.210 align:middle line:84%
so your mother must
still be alive?

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:15.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She is.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.008 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't get
them at all together.

00:40:18.008 --> 00:40:20.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't really get him visiting
her because when he visits her,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.109 align:middle line:90%
he feels really bad.

00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I think there might

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
have been some physical
abuse some time with her

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and him and some
emotional abuse.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Emotional.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't like it.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sorry.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't like it.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I want to say William or
Wills or Bill somewhere also

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.000 align:middle line:90%
with that name.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Would that make sense?

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.340 align:middle line:90%
He wants to bring in that name.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know he's trying
to help you settle down.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.130 align:middle line:84%
You, yourself have a
hard time settling down.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.458 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I have a
hard time settling down.

00:40:47.458 --> 00:40:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And it comes to a point
where you don't really

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.729 align:middle line:90%
feel comfortable with yourself.

00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:56.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a feeling of, I can't
feel comfortable with who I am,

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.853 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who I am, I don't
feel comfortable with who I am.

00:40:58.853 --> 00:41:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that stuff
you get in from genetics,

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.595 align:middle line:90%
you know, from your dad's side.

00:41:02.595 --> 00:41:03.470 align:middle line:90%
I've got to say that.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
right like this.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But you're so much
better than that.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.165 align:middle line:90%
You're not your dad.

00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're not your mom.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:08.581 align:middle line:90%
You're your person.

00:41:08.581 --> 00:41:09.480 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
get-- I would love

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.896 align:middle line:84%
for you to start doing
yoga on a regular basis

00:41:12.896 --> 00:41:14.572 align:middle line:84%
and meditation on
a regular basis.

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like the
people that you're around.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh?

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't like
the people you're around.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.834 align:middle line:84%
Don't know who it is, but I
don't like the people around.

00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:24.165 align:middle line:84%
Have you been around a
treatment center at all?

00:41:24.165 --> 00:41:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Have you ever
thought working about one?

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Working one as a
volunteer person?

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.015 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I like that.

00:41:29.015 --> 00:41:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I really, really
like you being in that energy.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.214 align:middle line:84%
I like you to help people
like in a treatment center.

00:41:35.214 --> 00:41:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like if you help
them, you're helping yourself.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.899 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel very
unsure of myself.

00:41:39.899 --> 00:41:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Were
you married twice?

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.712 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:41:42.712 --> 00:41:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, he just
said that to my head here.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So he's
saying, and she's still

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:46.850 align:middle line:90%
finding herself.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.016 align:middle line:84%
And he's apologizing for
not having the relationship

00:41:49.016 --> 00:41:50.310 align:middle line:90%
with you like he should have.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't have a
father-son relationship

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.764 align:middle line:84%
with you, and he was a
distant father at the best.

00:41:53.764 --> 00:41:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: At best, he says.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.470 align:middle line:90%
He didn't give a crap.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's saying.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:90%
He didn't give a crap.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.125 align:middle line:90%
That's how he's saying it.

00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:00.060 align:middle line:90%
That's how he's saying it now.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.393 align:middle line:84%
So we're giving him the space
to come into just to just,

00:42:02.393 --> 00:42:04.370 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, heal that
relationship with you,

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:84%
let you know he came
all this way just

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to let you know he's
around you and thanking you

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.170 align:middle line:84%
as best as he's able
to, as he's capable of.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if you
want to get her numbers.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.044 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Of course.

00:42:14.044 --> 00:42:15.207 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:42:15.207 --> 00:42:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm going to tell you.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I can guess a couple of
numbers for her though.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: I mean, what you say.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be a two.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:90%
There has to be a nine.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.970 align:middle line:90%
So let's see.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:90%
What's your date of birth?

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.982 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 4/22/65.

00:42:23.982 --> 00:42:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Well, there's
double two, thank you.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.271 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:27.271 --> 00:42:27.770 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:90%
4/22 what?

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.767 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 1965.

00:42:29.767 --> 00:42:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, OK.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.044 align:middle line:90%
So born on a four.

00:42:32.044 --> 00:42:33.835 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
an interesting person.

00:42:33.835 --> 00:42:34.800 align:middle line:90%
It's complex.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Oh, she's
a two life path.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Who said two first?

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:38.459 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was Aunt Glynis.

00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:39.000 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I will be here.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.940 align:middle line:90%
The Numbers Lady.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why I knew that.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Twos feel so deeply.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you could, you
would collapse and cry.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.482 align:middle line:90%
And you try so hard to be stoic.

00:42:52.482 --> 00:42:54.315 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I can't
clear everybody from me.

00:42:54.315 --> 00:42:56.275 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I know,
honey, but yes you can.

00:42:56.275 --> 00:42:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And one
of the things--

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I know he does other exercise--
but I always think of it

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:84%
as the Starship Enterprise,
which we are evidently--

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:90%
--on the Enterprise.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But what you do
is every morning, you light

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:84%
your white candle,
you shut your eyes,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and you pretend you're the ship
that has the safety lights that

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.710 align:middle line:90%
come up to protect it.

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.970 align:middle line:90%
What's that called, guys?

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Shield.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Put the shields up.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Your shields are down,
and they can't be.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.160 align:middle line:90%
So here's what's ironic.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.284 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a good mood
and you're full of love,

00:43:25.284 --> 00:43:26.520 align:middle line:90%
someone stabs you.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Like one of the negatives.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, oh my god.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I was so happy.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.026 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Completely deflate.

00:43:31.026 --> 00:43:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: If you put the
shields up, you're still happy.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.410 align:middle line:90%
You still could be happy.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But you're like, I'm
not going to fall in.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:37.302 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And my
analogy to the two,

00:43:37.302 --> 00:43:38.802 align:middle line:84%
if someone fell in
the well that you

00:43:38.802 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:84%
love, you'd jump in the
well and go, what's wrong?

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:90%
Now we're both in there.

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.078 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So you
didn't save them.

00:43:44.078 --> 00:43:45.832 align:middle line:90%
You didn't save you either.

00:43:45.832 --> 00:43:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Master number means
you feel called

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to master your life, so
again, hyper critical.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Your standards are way too high.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:84%
When it goes wrong,
you beat yourself up.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:middle line:84%
An eight attitude means--
here's where you're ironic.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.410 align:middle line:90%
You do speak your mind.

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.679 align:middle line:90%
You do get upset.

00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, when you're pushed
to the wall, you go off.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:90%
She is something to watch.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Like a reality
program could be you.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:06.182 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:06.182 --> 00:44:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I can see that.

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But then when
it's over, you're crushed.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And you're
drained and depleted.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I never
wanted to go there.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.093 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So I'm telling
you just by your numbers

00:44:15.093 --> 00:44:18.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to get back to
your heart and protect it.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.781 align:middle line:90%
Your two needs love.

00:44:19.781 --> 00:44:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had a heart
attack, and I can't open up.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:22.822 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Not surprising.

00:44:22.822 --> 00:44:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
not surprising.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.303 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Not surprising.

00:44:24.303 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
A heart attack simply
means too much.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I did too much.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to have to
suggest numberslady.com.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Track me down.

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I want to fix your numbers,
because she's a mess.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is
that your website?

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: I'm afraid it is.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:35.346 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, James.

00:44:35.346 --> 00:44:36.209 align:middle line:90%
It is my website.

00:44:36.209 --> 00:44:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mention it again.

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.821 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: It's
www.numberslady.com It's true.

00:44:40.821 --> 00:44:41.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:90%
That's uncanny.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.249 align:middle line:90%
But numberslady.com.

00:44:44.249 --> 00:44:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And do we talk about his dad--
her-- just to see what he was?

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.878 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:46.878 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you know his birthday?

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.888 align:middle line:90%
You know your dad's birthday?

00:44:48.888 --> 00:44:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: He has a
seven, the father.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.987 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 8/21/1939.

00:44:52.987 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.981 align:middle line:90%
8/21/1939.

00:44:55.981 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leo.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: So three, two,
two, three, three six.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:44:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leo.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:00.667 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah.

00:45:00.667 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just saying.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:02.115 align:middle line:90%
Leo.

00:45:02.115 --> 00:45:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah,
well, I'm sorry.

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:03.910 align:middle line:90%
August 23.

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Does this scream Leo?

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.946 align:middle line:84%
I only see a lion when
I look at this guy.

00:45:06.946 --> 00:45:07.445 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:07.445 --> 00:45:09.550 align:middle line:90%
So don't talk to me about Leo.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's the heartbreak
about your father.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.105 align:middle line:84%
He could be very
charming, you know?

00:45:16.105 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:90%
He was funny.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.884 align:middle line:84%
When he was funny,
you really liked him.

00:45:18.884 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.216 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But because
he was ultimately

00:45:21.216 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:84%
a six, if daddy ain't
happy, no one's happy.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Moody.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Moody.

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: He could be so moody.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- and remember,
since you're so darn sensitive,

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.070 align:middle line:84%
so you're having a good time,
and now Dad's in a bad mood

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.300 align:middle line:90%
and now you're not happy.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh gosh.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:90%
How do we fix this?

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.870 align:middle line:90%
How do we make it better?

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:35.932 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't.

00:45:35.932 --> 00:45:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that you had
a heart attack already

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.299 align:middle line:84%
tells me-- when was
that, by the way?

00:45:40.299 --> 00:45:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 15 years ago.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take your
life back, your power back.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Stop feeling so much.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.020 align:middle line:90%
You really can overcome this.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.130 align:middle line:84%
I know-- You know, this
sounds wild, but I always say,

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
the pity pool, make sure it's
not warm and comfortable.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:55.900 align:middle line:90%
You have a nice pool.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:90%
When you swim, it feels good.

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Mine's ice cold.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I jump in it and go, oh god.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get out.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.120 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just stop paying
that bill for the warm water--

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.454 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:08.454 --> 00:46:10.870 align:middle line:84%
--and make it ice cold so it's
not even an option anymore.

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, because
that's not who you are.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: It's not who you
are, and it's stopping you

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
from having this great
life you deserve.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, you can't
identify with that anymore,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:18.759 align:middle line:90%
because we're not our past.

00:46:18.759 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:90%
We're not our past.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: No.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
we're not our future.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.810 align:middle line:84%
We're just now, in
this moment now.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: That's right.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
the more we live in--

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
got diagnosed with all

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.290 align:middle line:84%
of those people's
diseases though.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:28.325 align:middle line:90%
And so it's hard to disconnect.

00:46:28.325 --> 00:46:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If you want them,
you can have anything you want.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: How about this?

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:84%
What you don't
deal with mentally

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:90%
will attack you physically.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So of course you
just took it all on.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's very true.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.565 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But you
can get rid of that.

00:46:38.565 --> 00:46:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know Gaiam
supports Louise Hay.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.940 align:middle line:90%
You can heal your life.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.695 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the book?

00:46:42.695 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Time to
stay home and read it.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Read it.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:45.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.231 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And affirm
it and kick that out.

00:46:47.231 --> 00:46:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any of that.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:49.810 align:middle line:90%
You don't need that.

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:50.976 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You make life.

00:46:50.976 --> 00:46:52.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't let life happen to you.

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.380 align:middle line:90%
You make life happen.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:53.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.940 align:middle line:90%
That's really important.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
For years before,
you let life happen.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got to
make life happen.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:46:59.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
start with yourself.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.416 align:middle line:90%
God bless, sweetheart.

00:47:03.416 --> 00:47:04.496 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:04.496 --> 00:47:05.930 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:07.992 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:07.992 --> 00:47:09.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we'll try
something very different

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:10.560 align:middle line:90%
now that we have Glynis here.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
That was really,
really interesting.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with Glynis
starting going in and then

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
see what I can pick up
from what Glynis gets.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So I call this
fast food reads in

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.947 align:middle line:84%
that we could flip
through several people

00:47:20.947 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
in your audience, which
I'm sure they'd love that.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh great.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.337 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Over here has
felt neglected, I'm positive.

00:47:26.337 --> 00:47:28.170 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you're
not even looking at us.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going over here,
and I'm going to you.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.530 align:middle line:90%
You look neglected.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.197 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I was feeling
a little bit neglected.

00:47:35.197 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.675 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:36.675 --> 00:47:38.750 align:middle line:90%
What's the name you go by?

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I actually--

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Today.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, today?

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Rebecca.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Rebecca.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's a beautiful name.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.362 align:middle line:90%
And date of birth?

00:47:44.362 --> 00:47:45.236 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 10/28/51.

00:47:45.236 --> 00:47:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Well, wait.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.756 align:middle line:84%
When you're stripping,
what name do you go by?

00:47:47.756 --> 00:47:48.762 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I use your
name when I'm stripping.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.549 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Then you ought
to make a lot of money.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:55.940 align:middle line:90%
They can hook you up.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:56.440 align:middle line:90%
Glynis--

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're the psychic.

00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.370 align:middle line:90%
You go back down the chain.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.661 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Glynis the stripper.

00:47:59.661 --> 00:48:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.040 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.220 align:middle line:90%
So Rebecca.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And then date of birth?

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 10/28/51.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: 51.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.080 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.725 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:10.725 --> 00:48:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You're ultimately a nine
life path, as are you, James.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.539 align:middle line:90%
It is the old soul.

00:48:14.539 --> 00:48:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It means when you
were a little girl,

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.505 align:middle line:84%
you knew things
beyond your years.

00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:19.010 align:middle line:90%
You always were more evolved.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.070 align:middle line:84%
You watched your parents like
a science project, you know?

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.340 align:middle line:90%
You kind of made a note.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:84%
What's acceptable, what
do I like, what don't I

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.640 align:middle line:84%
like, what won't I
do when I grow up?

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.030 align:middle line:90%
You did all of that.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you're
born on a one day, which

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.960 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning--
like in numerology, one

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.250 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning, nine is
the number of completion--

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.430 align:middle line:84%
it tells me you-- the world
is your oyster, Rebecca.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.840 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing you can't do.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you like
to experiment a lot.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.979 align:middle line:90%
Like look at so many things.

00:48:43.979 --> 00:48:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately,
your attitude number's

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:47.330 align:middle line:90%
two which means psychic.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.500 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about psychic,
you really have it.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Like, people can get
up in front of you,

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:52.240 align:middle line:90%
you're like, I like this person.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.365 align:middle line:84%
Or you meet someone and
go, that doesn't feel good.

00:48:54.365 --> 00:48:55.809 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it really fast.

00:48:55.809 --> 00:48:57.100 align:middle line:90%
How true has that been for you?

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.832 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 100%.

00:48:57.832 --> 00:48:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Right.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.229 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a thing
called personal year cycle

00:49:02.229 --> 00:49:03.020 align:middle line:90%
that we talk about.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And in your case,
this year you're

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.810 align:middle line:84%
on a personal year
of nine, which

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.130 align:middle line:84%
is clearing your space
for new beginnings.

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So throwing things away
and considering movement

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:13.110 align:middle line:90%
in work and home.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So tell me what you're
doing in that way.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I just
got back from Portugal.

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK, so you left.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And how long were you there?

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Six weeks.

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: OK.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.264 align:middle line:84%
And that had to
be great for you.

00:49:22.264 --> 00:49:23.784 align:middle line:84%
Because that whole
experience of,

00:49:23.784 --> 00:49:25.450 align:middle line:84%
what am I learning,
and then coming back

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:26.679 align:middle line:90%
with that new knowledge.

00:49:26.679 --> 00:49:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But what about your
home environment?

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm in a temporary
situation, which I always am.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah, but
you need to get out.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying it's
not ideal where you are.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But next year is the
cycle of one for you,

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.320 align:middle line:84%
which is getting into the
driver's seat of your life.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
like work wise,

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.990 align:middle line:84%
creatively, it's time
for you to act on it.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.781 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:90%
I feel that.

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And Portugal
was a sense for you

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.085 align:middle line:84%
to go way and cleanse
things, move things, brand

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:90%
new beginnings.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:49.095 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:49.095 --> 00:49:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now I don't know
if your mom had passed over,

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.060 align:middle line:90%
please.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Your mother passed over?

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Your mother?

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.882 align:middle line:84%
Because I get her right
to the side of you.

00:49:54.882 --> 00:49:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel like part of
that trip to Portugal

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:58.676 align:middle line:84%
was saying goodbye
to your mother.

00:49:58.676 --> 00:49:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um--

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Or letting
go of old things.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Letting
go of old things.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.351 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:50:03.351 --> 00:50:04.949 align:middle line:84%
I think your
mother's a nice lady.

00:50:04.949 --> 00:50:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Even though you didn't know her,
I think she was a nice lady.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that your
mother could only

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:10.050 align:middle line:84%
do with what she
was-- what she knew.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.171 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't
think she knew a lot.

00:50:12.171 --> 00:50:14.022 align:middle line:84%
I think that by her
age of 11 or 12,

00:50:14.022 --> 00:50:16.345 align:middle line:84%
she was forced into
being an adult.

00:50:16.345 --> 00:50:17.749 align:middle line:90%
And she had to be the adult.

00:50:17.749 --> 00:50:19.665 align:middle line:84%
And I think that her
childhood went like that.

00:50:19.665 --> 00:50:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about that?

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know
a lot about it though.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I just know with
this lady that she'd

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.911 align:middle line:84%
be an adult when
she was younger.

00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I just get that really strong.

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.851 align:middle line:84%
And she keeps on
telling me that you

00:50:27.851 --> 00:50:29.350 align:middle line:84%
were not there when
she passed then?

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:31.025 align:middle line:84%
You weren't around
when she passed?

00:50:31.025 --> 00:50:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We
weren't communicating.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Let me tell
you why I know that,

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.850 align:middle line:90%
is she had to let her mom go.

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, a healthy nine often
is nowhere near their family.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If I say to a nine life
path, where do you--

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he has parents.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe James
Van Praagh has parents?

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen them.

00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.230 align:middle line:90%
The point is, he's a nine.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And what nines have
to do is they go off

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.456 align:middle line:84%
to do their own adventure,
to live their own life.

00:50:53.456 --> 00:50:54.830 align:middle line:84%
If they stay close
to the family,

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.149 align:middle line:90%
it's often dysfunctional.

00:50:56.149 --> 00:50:57.190 align:middle line:90%
So you had to let her go.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, I got to
get happy for me now.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Now it's my turn.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:05.710 align:middle line:84%
But the number nine also means
movement of-- what's that line?

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:08.050 align:middle line:84%
The prophet is not
recognized in their hometown?

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:08.850 align:middle line:90%
The prophet?

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.559 align:middle line:90%
You had to go away to be you.

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're a teacher.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:90%
You know you're a teacher.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.080 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.871 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of bringing that out

00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of yourself, that own
self-worth of yourself.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And try to not live
your parents' lives;

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.080 align:middle line:90%
live your own life.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
very interesting

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that you said I'm a
teacher, because I

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.710 align:middle line:84%
was told that a long
time ago in a dream.

00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:25.025 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm a psychic.

00:51:25.025 --> 00:51:25.525 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:51:25.525 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
it's like, teach what?

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:27.840 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: No,
but you know what?

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what
you teach, just

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:32.090 align:middle line:84%
like that disconnect
from family, about hope.

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:33.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all hope for you.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:36.070 align:middle line:84%
When you feel you give someone
else hope, you feel better.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
teacher you will be.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Teach about life.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.688 align:middle line:90%
Teach about life.

00:51:39.688 --> 00:51:41.795 align:middle line:84%
I know your dad also
must have passed over

00:51:41.795 --> 00:51:42.920 align:middle line:90%
because he's over this way.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.190 align:middle line:90%
But your mother's over here.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your mother
wants to say that she's-- hello

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.575 align:middle line:90%
and she's concerned about you.

00:51:47.575 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about the
other family members, she said.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Get in contact with
the family members

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:90%
she was talking to me about.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you just
recently tried calling somebody

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.200 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't call you back.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said she's trying
to help you with them.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Your sister or brother
or something like this,

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
she's trying to
help you with that.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going
to have two more

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.750 align:middle line:84%
places of living
before you settle down.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me, two more
places of living, settle down.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like
that your things

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.946 align:middle line:90%
are in two different places.

00:52:07.946 --> 00:52:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So I don't like your
storage over here

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and your other things
are over there.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like two different places
where your things are at.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, not really.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Where do you have your things?

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:17.018 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a minimalist.

00:52:17.018 --> 00:52:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're a minimalist.

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So do you have something
at a friend's house?

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.873 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: She has a
toothbrush and that necklace.

00:52:21.873 --> 00:52:22.539 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let me respect
what the mother is saying.

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:26.310 align:middle line:84%
You have things at
someone else's house.

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I do have
paperwork at my son's house.

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.690 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to hold on to
some things a little bit.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Why do they scare you?

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's just baggage,
literally, to carry around.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yep.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Just pen, piece of
paper, a pen, that

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:84%
would be good to
hold onto eventually.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Or a toiletry bag.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: Can I tell
her something kind of fun

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.910 align:middle line:90%
about her?

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Your pinnacle cycle, her final
pinnacle that she's in right

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.660 align:middle line:90%
now is nine.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And nine is when you give
to others, you receive.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important that you give.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Like, that is who you are now.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't want to
keep too much for myself.

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.919 align:middle line:84%
Because every time you give,
you actually feel better,

00:53:00.919 --> 00:53:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and then the universe kind
of takes care of you anyway.

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that what's happening?

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You didn't have
a relationship with your dad

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.285 align:middle line:90%
that much, did you?

00:53:07.285 --> 00:53:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not a good one.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Not a good one.

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I've just got your dad
and your mother there,

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:90%
but they're looking after you.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And be OK with getting
favors from people.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.070 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:16.302 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to ask for help.

00:53:16.302 --> 00:53:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: You're not good
at asking for help at all.

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No,
that's what they said.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.380 align:middle line:90%
You gotta do that.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.624 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
do that, relearn that one.

00:53:22.624 --> 00:53:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: But are
you good at it?

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm pretty
good at it when I need it.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yeah?

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh yeah.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.103 align:middle line:90%
I'll call you.

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:28.914 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: I think
that's other numbers.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the nine life
path, their big thing

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:35.734 align:middle line:84%
is, if you care about
me, you know what I need.

00:53:35.734 --> 00:53:36.900 align:middle line:90%
And I shouldn't have to ask.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.015 align:middle line:90%
You often think that.

00:53:38.015 --> 00:53:40.640 align:middle line:84%
If they really care-- so if they
don't care, I'll do it myself.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy is, if
you were in the ocean

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're drowning
they're like, look.

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.440 align:middle line:90%
She's swimming.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.645 align:middle line:90%
And your head's bobbing.

00:53:45.645 --> 00:53:47.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, she's drowning.

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But you look OK because
you didn't tell them.

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:84%
That's your lesson
is to speak up.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:52.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell
people what's up.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You guys
should talk to each other.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've actually
been working on that,

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.647 align:middle line:84%
and it's been hard,
but I've been doing it.

00:53:57.647 --> 00:53:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANTS: And you're
in the cycle to do it.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Life path, she's-- her
personal year, her pinnacle,

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.871 align:middle line:90%
and her life path is all nine.

00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You guys should
hook up after the show is over.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.051 align:middle line:84%
Because you guys have
very similar energies

00:54:09.051 --> 00:54:10.727 align:middle line:84%
and life experiences,
you two girls.

00:54:10.727 --> 00:54:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you, everyone.

00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Glynis very much.

00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.680 align:middle line:84%

you're so welcome.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:13.950 align:middle line:90%

you, everyone.

00:54:15.366 --> 00:54:15.933 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:15.933 --> 00:54:17.055 align:middle line:90%
You want to come with me?

00:54:17.055 --> 00:54:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANTS: Yes, I do.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Thank you and until next
time, go with love and light.

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:23.871 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot.

00:54:23.871 --> 00:54:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Follow me, baby.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Come on, let's go.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Come on, let's go.
