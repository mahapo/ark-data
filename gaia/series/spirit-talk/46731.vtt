00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.906 align:middle line:84%
>>And now world-renowned
spirit medium James Van Praagh.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.114 align:middle line:90%
>> JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hey.

00:00:32.114 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.021 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.824 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also
for being here.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Spirit
Talk," where I take you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And every experience
is brand new,

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
so I never know what's
going to happen,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I never know what to expect,
and that's why I do this show.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I think in life
always expect the unexpected.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So I thought today we
would talk about miracles.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
I really think that people have
to understand miracles more.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think if they did, they
would realize that miracles are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
part of our everyday
life, and we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.576 align:middle line:84%
can have miracles in our life
if we just work with that energy

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and we come to
that awareness, we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:84%
come to that sense
of mindfulness, yes?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So how many people here
in the studio audience

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
have experienced miracles
in some way or another?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:90%
You have, you have, you have.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:90%
We all have, yes?

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:90%
But do we acknowledge them?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we don't
acknowledge them,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
because we won't
have to-- they'll

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.865 align:middle line:84%
be right there in
front of us, and we

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:26.570 align:middle line:84%
know this is-- a
miracle has happened.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
But I think miracles can
happen in little ways.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
I think in subtle ways
they happen as well.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I think what a
miracle is is really

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:90%
confirmation of the divine.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I really believe it's
confirmation of the divine,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and I think a miracle
happens every single day.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Within the body, the
cells change and die off

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.334 align:middle line:90%
and grow and reproduce.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we look
around us and every day

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
we experience a brand new
day, I think that's a miracle.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.821 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just God
showing God's self.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we are
all that God energy.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.035 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could have
miracles and miracles are

00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
a part of our
everyday existence,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.691 align:middle line:84%
as long as we take the time to
be mindful about who we are,

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
that we are spirit, first
and foremost, having

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:90%
this physical experience.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe-- whether
you believe this or not,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's fine, because I just
really channel, if you will,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:84%
or give information out, and I
just send it out to the ethers

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to people there and
to you people here.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you take this
information into your hearts

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and it sounds right, it resonate
as truth within your being,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:90%
then I say keep it.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.097 align:middle line:90%
And if it doesn't, throw it out.

00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
You're not ready for
that yet, or it's

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.221 align:middle line:84%
a different way of
looking at things.

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:90%
And I love that.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do that,
you can always learn.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
You're always opening to
learning different things,

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
learning from
everybody on your path.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Every day miracles come to
you in all different ways.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You might meet
somebody and they say

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
something which
resonates something

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
within you, which makes you
to behave a certain way,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:90%
to cause an action to happen.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And these how
miracles get started.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
If you want more
miracles in your life,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I think you really have to align
yourself with your divineness.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
When you align yourself with
your truth of who you truly

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
are and you align
yourself with that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get caught
up in the result of it,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't get caught up
in the expectation of it,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
you just in a way
just are and just are

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
open to whatever
you receive, then

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I think you give
miracles a place

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
to grow and to live, to
expand, and to experience them.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound good?

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIENCE REPLYING
 AFFIRMATIVELY]

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.283 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:03:24.283 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
I really do believe that.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I do believe when
we're open to it,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
the universe always says
yes, that God force,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
which we are all
that divine energy.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.674 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe, and
I know everyone here

00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and everyone there
that's watching this,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:90%
you've had those miracles.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.060 align:middle line:84%
You've had that
energy of the divine

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:90%
in your life presenting itself.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you all to
be prepared for miracles,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
big or small, and just
be open to the experience

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
of in your life, in your own
lifetime you leave here today

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:84%
when you stop watching this,
be open to how the universe,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
how miracles are going
to present themselves.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
They might not come to you
and say, hi, I'm a miracle.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Little things, it's those
little subtle things

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:90%
that make all the difference.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIENCE REPLYING
 AFFIRMATIVELY]

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you something, too,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's very important
that everybody realize,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:84%
that because we're all energy
and that we are interacting

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
with people every
day on our path,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that nobody
comes upon your path that's

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:90%
not meant to be.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in accidents.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.578 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in accidents.

00:04:24.578 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I believe in divine
intervention.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.402 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in alignment
with the divine energy,

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing what
we're supposed to experience.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember that we
are all souls down here having

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
this human experience, and this
is our schoolroom down here.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
We come back, and we
learn many, many lessons.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And some of those lessons
aren't easy lessons.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.246 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
classes that we take

00:04:43.246 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
are very hard ones
because we want to grow.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.800 align:middle line:90%
We want to grow spiritually.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So I know people
in this audience

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.232 align:middle line:84%
have had situations with
their families, right?

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Difficult things.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Families are the hardest.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
The hardest lessons
a lot of times

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
are families because
they're right with you.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
They force you to
behave a certain way.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They force you to
choose how you're

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
going to react to
a situation, yeah?

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.154 align:middle line:84%
I tell people all the time
that you have no control.

00:05:07.154 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Now some people are starting
to freak out when I say that.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:90%
You have no control.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:90%
You can't control other people.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:90%
You can't control situations.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that right?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
But what you can
control is how you

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
respond, how you
react to other people.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So you can't control
how they're going to be

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
or what they're going to say
or what they're going to do,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:84%
but you certainly
are in control of how

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:90%
is that going to sit with you.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Will I take that in?

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Do I get it on an
emotional level?

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Am I fast to judge?

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Which is fear-based.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Judgment is fear-based.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.379 align:middle line:84%
Or do I step back,
take a breath,

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
and say, see it for what it is?

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
respond to this?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I think if you just
stop, take a breath,

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
step back, and become very
objective in how you're

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
going to respond, is this
for your highest good?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Is this in alignment with
my divine self, my reaction?

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you must remember
that you are responsible,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:84%
as a spirit being
here on this Earth,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
you're responsible for
your thoughts, your words,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and your deeds.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Everyone.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So you as a miracle of
life and this human life,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.200 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have to have
the responsibility that what

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.870 align:middle line:84%
we give out with the
mouth, with the thoughts,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.474 align:middle line:84%
with our bodies, the
language that we have

00:06:16.474 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
to be responsible for what
we're sending out to the Earth,

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:90%
to other people in our space.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.947 align:middle line:84%
When you pass over,
your time is done here,

00:06:23.947 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:90%
we go to the other side of life.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:84%
We go to the spiritual world,
the other dimension, the higher

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.434 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:06:28.434 --> 00:06:29.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
things that we do

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
is we look back at our lives,
and we see all the good things

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
we did, the bad things we did,
the indifferent things we did,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and we have to try
to forgive ourselves.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
There is no God that says,
you go there, you go there,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:90%
you go there.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:90%
We are our own judge and jury.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Many people think, well,
my family was this way

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and they made me this way.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You take responsibility for
what you do in your life.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you pass over and
you have this life review

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and you see your whole
life flash before you,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:84%
you'll see all the little things
that you did in your life,

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.700 align:middle line:84%
the things that made an effect
on other people, those little

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
miracles you created
for other people

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
or those miracles you did
not create for other people.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you got to look
at yourself and say, wow,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.131 align:middle line:90%
I should have done that better.

00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd passed that test when
I was in the school of Earth.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
So as you're here today and
as you're watching this,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
just be mindful that one
day when the time comes,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
when you go back home
to spirit, you're

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
going to look at
your life and you're

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.049 align:middle line:90%
going to have to judge yourself.

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to judge yourself
and have a wonderful experience

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
here and look back at your life,
wow, I really did a great job,

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I made such a difference
in that world,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I did the best I
could possibly do?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want to look
back and say, wow, darn,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I was so judgmental,
oh, I shouldn't

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
have done that, so
limiting in my mind,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:90%
why didn't I open myself up?

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So as you're here today
and you're watching this,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Time to change.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So right now I'm giving you
back your responsibility

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.912 align:middle line:84%
for your thoughts, your
words, and your deeds.

00:08:00.912 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
go now and I just

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
want to move along here because
we have so much to do today.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to do a
little exercise with you.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And this exercise
is really cool.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really cool.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.575 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
at home, of course.

00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:90%
This is a great exercise.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.735 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to know that
all around you, this atmosphere

00:08:18.735 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that you've created
around you, there's

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
a lovely, wonderful
atmosphere all around you.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.277 align:middle line:84%
Some people refer
to it as the aura.

00:08:25.277 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to say,
yes, it is the aura,

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:90%
but then there's some.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:84%
There's like a little
world around you

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
in your atmosphere,
which is really

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
created by your thoughts, yeah?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Because thoughts are energy.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So you create this
lovely energy around you

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
or not a lovely energy around
you by what you think, yeah?

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So the energy around
you, that atmosphere

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
can grow and expand based upon
how much love you give out.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Love is the grower.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Love is God.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And with that
energy of love, you

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:90%
expand, you expand, you expand.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Fear, you close on in.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Fear is limiting.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Love is expansive, right?

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So all around you
in this atmosphere,

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
this lovely atmosphere is
beautiful lights and colors

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.630 align:middle line:84%
from your thoughts, your
experiences in life,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:90%
your goals in the future.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:90%
It's all around you.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So in the spirit
world, which are

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
right behind you and
around you, they actually

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.720 align:middle line:84%
share the space
with you many times.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And how many people here
have been driving their car,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and they think of a loved
one that passed over?

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:90%
All of you.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure all of you at home.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.224 align:middle line:84%
That's because the spirit
is sitting right next to you

00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and they're sending
into your atmosphere

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
an image of themselves, a
feeling about themselves.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So you will pick up their
energy, because they're

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
walking right into
your atmosphere.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Pretty cool.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.725 align:middle line:84%
So you don't really need
a medium, necessarily,

00:09:46.725 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
them, because you

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:90%
connect with them all the time.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Your conscious mind
might not be aware of it,

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:84%
but they definitely share
the space that we're in.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do a
little exercise with you.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to do is I want
you to experience, if you will,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.650 align:middle line:84%
the spirit world coming so,
so close to you, so very,

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
very close to you
that you actually

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
will share this
space with the spirit

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and be able to let them use you
in a way that they become you,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:90%
you become them, and you blend.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Does that sound cool?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:90%
We're up for that?

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a really great exercise.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:23.913 align:middle line:90%
You're going to love this.

00:10:23.913 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
close our eyes,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to play some
music behind my voice.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So like a little
meditation type of thing.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.710 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a focus exercise.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.825 align:middle line:90%
It's a little journey exercise.

00:10:34.825 --> 00:10:35.325 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:35.325 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.351 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:41.851 align:middle line:90%
Great.

>> VAN PRAAGH: So all I want
you to do is just give yourself

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and your mind, I want you to
put out just that thought that

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give myself
this time to be with myself.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:90%
We worry so much about the past.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
The past has already happened.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.425 align:middle line:90%
Not much we can do about that.

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just close our eyes.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Just close your
eyes and just listen

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:90%

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Send out a thought
to the spirit world.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And we ask, dear spirit friends,
come close to us right now.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
there is light within me

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:90%
that shares a light within you.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is meant to be, to
come close to my atmosphere,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:84%
to stand so very close
to me, to be part of me,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I welcome you now to
come so close to me,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
you stand right behind me
and you place your hands

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
upon my shoulders and
just step so close.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And whoever comes in,
just let them come in.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't control it.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You just open up
the space for who's

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.770 align:middle line:90%
ever meant to come through.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Who's ever meant to come
by, let them do that.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
For we sit for the highest
good of the spirit world.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.898 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] Great.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Another deep breath.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.030 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] And just one
more time, a lovely new breath.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.068 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:13:48.068 --> 00:13:49.980 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] Good.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And we ask that spirit now,
just open up your mind,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
open up your heart, and let them
just come very close to you,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:84%
so close to you they
step into your space.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And let your arms
because their arms.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.695 align:middle line:84%
Let your shoulders
become their shoulders.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Let your legs become their
legs, your feet their feet,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:84%
your neck and your head
their neck and head.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Your eyes become their eyes.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And just let them move into that
space and just becomes them,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
become one, and let them
blend, blend with you.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.763 align:middle line:84%
And just let them, as if they're
sitting right through you

00:14:33.763 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:90%
and you feel them.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:90%
You might feel their bodies.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You might think of things
you've never thought

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:84%
of before, because now
it's their thoughts.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
You might see things
you've never seen before,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:47.935 align:middle line:90%
because it's their visions.

00:14:47.935 --> 00:14:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.288 align:middle line:84%
And just sit with that for a few
moments and just be with that.

00:14:56.288 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.690 align:middle line:84%
How wonderful it is that they
share this space with you,

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that you give them this
opportunity for you

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
to experience them
one more time,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
let them experience a
physicality one more time.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.184 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:15:28.184 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, I can see
physically you're changing.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I see physically they
come so close to you

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
that your physicalness
is so different.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I see with each person
here in the audience

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
as you surrender,
surrender and release.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:90%
And thank them and bless them.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.285 align:middle line:84%
Dear friends, we thank
you and we bless you

00:16:01.285 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
for coming into this space
and sharing the space.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And now in your
mind, ask them now,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:84%
as you thank them with
gratitude, to step back now

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
behind you, once again
to step out of your space

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.386 align:middle line:90%
and go behind you.

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
As they put their arms
back on your shoulders

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and they step out of
your space and just

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
come back to your
own self, feeling

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
your feet on the
floor, your legs,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
your backs in the chairs,
your shoulders, and your arms,

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:90%
your neck and your head.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath back
to the body and inhale.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.233 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] And inhale.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.093 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:16:48.093 --> 00:16:50.830 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] And one more
time, fully back into the body,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.877 align:middle line:90%
and inhale.

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:54.322 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES AUDIBLY] And exhale.

00:16:54.322 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES AUDIBLY] Good.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.466 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:16:59.466 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.174 align:middle line:84%
Well, can I just say you
guys did a great job.

00:17:07.174 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%
You did a great, great job.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I was watching you
very, very carefully,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and I was very, very
aware of the atmosphere.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hearing from
spirit already--

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to cry because
I'm feeling emotional

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.125 align:middle line:84%
because I know a lot of
you were hit by that.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh-- that miracles happen now.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Miracles just happen.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
They just said
miracles just happen.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.894 align:middle line:90%
So I saw your changes.

00:17:26.894 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I saw the colors change
in a lot of people.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And once you surrendered,
the atmosphere grew,

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and I saw a lot.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.389 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
share with you-- see,

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
now I'm getting
emotional because I'm

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:90%
picking up your emotion.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected, so
it's all this oneness.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what
miracles happened.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.429 align:middle line:84%
So I first want to
come here with you

00:17:49.429 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
know what happened.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.386 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
mind standing up,

00:17:52.386 --> 00:17:54.652 align:middle line:84%
my dear, and sharing
with everybody here--

00:17:54.652 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and everybody at
home will see this

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
as well-- what your
experience was.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.569 align:middle line:90%
And here's a microphone.

00:17:58.569 --> 00:18:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you had a deep, deep
experience, and it was amazing.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It was if I'm watching a TV
and the scene is changing,

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.575 align:middle line:84%
and it's like the colors and the
furniture in the room changes,

00:18:09.575 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:90%
and it's like this whole thing.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And once you opened up and
let them in, it was like wow.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.682 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what
happened for you.

00:18:16.682 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It
was just beautiful.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.527 align:middle line:90%
I just felt their energy.

00:18:19.527 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And who was
it that came through for you?

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Two
particular people.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Was one a man?

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Was it dad or
something like this?

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:27.408 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:27.408 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
felt it so strong.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.295 align:middle line:84%
What did you
experience from him?

00:18:30.295 --> 00:18:32.832 align:middle line:84%
Because I got to connect with
him in a second, because he

00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:84%
was just standing
right behind you.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
When I said stand
behind somebody

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and put your hands on
the shoulders, I saw him.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was a
father, and he was saying,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:90%
I got to get through to her.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
I got to get through to her.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:90%
So tell me what you experienced.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.298 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Pure love.

00:18:43.298 --> 00:18:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I could just see red, and
my heart was resonating,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and it was beautiful.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Did you feel
something from, let's say,

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.044 align:middle line:84%
first your dad that you had
never felt before with him?

00:18:53.044 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE:
Forgiveness, I think.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.584 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Forgiveness.

00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:56.537 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Top of
the line, forgiveness.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.513 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:01.513 --> 00:19:02.129 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:02.129 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And what did he tell you?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Did he tell you anything
that you remember?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That
he's just with me.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: He's with you.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: He's
always with us.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And who
else came through for you?

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: My brother-in-law.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Your
brother-in-law.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:11.925 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:11.925 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.114 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:13.114 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Very different energy.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I know
they're together.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.085 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very much.

00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Very
different energy.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
There was also a
lady behind you.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So she might not have come
through into the body with you,

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:90%
but she was standing right here.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
she would have somehow had

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:90%
a connection with your father.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if it's a mother
of his or a sister of his,

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
but I know that she
was right there.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So maybe she'll come
in when we start.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.913 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: But I
just want to give a--

00:19:33.913 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: May I start to
do my message from your father?

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.278 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I would love it.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Good,
because I need to.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Because he's right
here, and he's really

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:90%
strongly coming in here.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta ask you also--
go on, go on, go on.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
He's very funny, and he's
making these crack-up jokes,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and he has a very
dry sense of humor,

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's laughing
about nose hairs.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.192 align:middle line:84%
Now don't ask me why, but
he's talking about nose hairs.

00:19:58.192 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So there must have been some
joke or some goofy thing

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:90%
about nose hairs.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
What is that about?

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's so weird,
but he's like, the nose hairs,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.505 align:middle line:90%
and there's a joke about it.

00:20:08.505 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:90%
This is what he's talking about.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I got you.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about your mother.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:90%
Is your mother still alive here?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Uh-huh.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Because he's talking
about mom so strongly,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:90%
and he wants-- right.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:90%
He's so strong, your dad.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.700 align:middle line:84%
He wants her to know
that he's with her,

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and why would she
doubt him playing

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.894 align:middle line:90%
with the lights around her?

00:20:25.894 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because he said I
recently was there playing with

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:90%
the lights with her.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
she either got her hair redone

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.535 align:middle line:84%
or was talking about
getting her hair changed.

00:20:32.535 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh my god, yes.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Because he just said,
I was just with her

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:90%
when she was talking about it.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she
wants to go away,

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.240 align:middle line:84%
but she never takes
time for herself.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
She never gets out and
does things on her own.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Very true.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.323 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I want you
to know that I don't necessarily

00:20:46.323 --> 00:20:47.590 align:middle line:90%
believe in life after death.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
When I was living,
I'm very pragmatic.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm very black and white, this
sort of thing was your dad.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And he's
very, very aware now.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I need to tell you
thank you for letting

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:90%
him know about life after death.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.033 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.191 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And he
said, I'm not in pain here.

00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:90%
He's not in pain here.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.994 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was in pain
at the end of my life,

00:21:02.994 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not in any pain here.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to lose his mind.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to lose that.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to go
through losing the mind.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.116 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And he has
nothing like that anymore.

00:21:12.116 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you think of him,
think of him as healthy.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:90%
I got you, dad.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:90%
I know, dad.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:90%
He's so funny.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
He said like this--
[EXHALES AUDIBLY]

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said you have referred
to him if he's in heaven,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:90%
he's playing golf.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And with others that
have crossed over too.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I often say they're
golfing together.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, he just
gave me this image of fore.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And I really got
to tell you, I know

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.077 align:middle line:84%
there's a white hat he's showing
me, like a white cap hat.

00:21:40.077 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I know I have one--

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You have one.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: --in my closet.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So that's it.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.421 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me, and
it's in a closet,

00:21:45.421 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very happy about that.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a photograph
with him golfing.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.281 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a
photograph of not only him

00:21:50.281 --> 00:21:51.890 align:middle line:84%
but other people
with him golfing.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's like after we
finished a round of golf,

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
we all went to the
clubhouse and had a picture.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:57.928 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:21:57.928 --> 00:22:00.362 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Now I love
Arnold Palmer, he's telling me.

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:01.324 align:middle line:90%
Why, I don't know.

00:22:01.324 --> 00:22:02.865 align:middle line:84%
But he's talking
about Arnold Palmer,

00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not sure if there's a
photo he had of Arnold Palmer,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that he liked Arnold Palmer,
or he drinks the Arnold Palmer.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.994 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but
he's giving Arnold Palmer.

00:22:10.994 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
understand that.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Got it, got it, got
it, got it, got it.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't get the brother-in-law
in very strongly,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to know that
he's around your sister.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.601 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Who
grew up Catholic?

00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Everybody
in my family.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.375 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Fine, perfect.

00:22:25.375 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Because I see Catholic.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And I get from the man,
I'm reaching my mind

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to get him around,
and I'm getting

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
told-- because he's not sure
about this sort of thing.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.477 align:middle line:84%
Just because we come here
today doesn't necessarily

00:22:35.477 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
mean that they're going
to jump right in and talk.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:90%
They've got to be sure about it.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Now that's why I used
you with the blend

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:84%
with them, because I think
it helps them to open up.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.564 align:middle line:90%
It helps you to open up.

00:22:43.564 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Got it, got it.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:90%
He sits on the bed with her.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.104 align:middle line:90%
He sits on the bed with her.

00:22:48.104 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
tell you right now

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going
to move on, he's

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:90%
thinking about the computer.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.346 align:middle line:84%
So she did something on
the computer for him.

00:22:55.346 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
There was either a
memorial on that computer,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.881 align:middle line:84%
she created a page for him, and
she put his photograph on that,

00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and there were all these
sayings that people wrote in.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was a beautiful
heart, something with a heart.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.821 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the heart
had little flowers around it,

00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:90%
but it's on that page.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Would
you understand this?

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I would, yes.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.633 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's acknowledgement
for you and for your sister.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And please know that he
sees her with his ring

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.392 align:middle line:90%
all the time, the ring.

00:23:19.392 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And she can't get
rid of that ring.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
She's holding that ring.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.188 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure where is the
ring, but she has that ring

00:23:24.188 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:90%
so strongly, and he sees that.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So I got to leave
you with that, OK?

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's a lot.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm
so very grateful.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Can
I give you a hug?

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes,
you can give me a hug.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Of course you can.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.571 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:36.675 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.866 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's your energy too, so
I just want to tell you that.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.591 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
it helps other people,

00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:45.840 align:middle line:90%
too, here that are working.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I want to come over
here, and I just

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
want to ask someone else over
here what they experienced.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Was there something
very profound when

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
we did the blending,
the exercise?

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody else have something
happen that was unusual?

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Like this lady right there that
I'm staring at, that I know

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:84%
you did because your
energy was like [SINGS].

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm reading
this young lady here,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
your energy started
going [EXHALES AUDIBLY].

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So can we get the
microphone right there?

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.130 align:middle line:90%
And would you stand, honey?

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Actually, it
felt like they just rushed

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
in, and then all of my I
guess aches and pains--

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Gone.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Gone.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%
I was like, woah.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I was noticing as
you were moving up the body,

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:90%
I was like, woah.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.421 align:middle line:90%
That usually is a little sore.

00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:31.541 align:middle line:90%
It's not sore.

00:24:31.541 --> 00:24:32.665 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Not anymore.

00:24:32.665 --> 00:24:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It's where we place our minds.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So that let me
know that they were with me.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And did you pick
up anyone that actually used

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
the body that came into your
space that you could recognize?

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: My great-grandma.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.606 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Your great-grandma.

00:24:42.606 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Did she help to raise you?

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.067 align:middle line:84%
And did you remember that you
would make things with her?

00:24:47.067 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And can I just bring her
through for you, please?

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Would that be all right?

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.350 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's Tana.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.193 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Tana.

00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So Tana, you opened
up the door to her.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And also there's many
sisters in the spirit world.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.822 align:middle line:84%
So she said she has many sisters
on the other side of life.

00:25:00.822 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you, there must
have been two or three sisters

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.920 align:middle line:84%
that she would have on
the other side of life.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Then thank you.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.196 align:middle line:90%
I thank your response.

00:25:08.196 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I love that yes.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
That's great, because
of the energy.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.384 align:middle line:84%
But she's not the
only one over there.

00:25:12.384 --> 00:25:14.424 align:middle line:84%
Because I got to tell you
that she's right there,

00:25:14.424 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:90%
you picked up.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a vibration
you picked up,

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.048 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to pick up
someone else along with her.

00:25:19.048 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you
that did she or do

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:84%
you have some kind of
a glass collection,

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.127 align:middle line:90%
like figurines from glass?

00:25:25.127 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is
that you or her?

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You do.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a bird, a little
bird, a glass bird, please?

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:90%
So you understand a glass bird.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.115 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because for some
reason when I look at that bird

00:25:36.115 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel just connected
and I think of her.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
like a bluebird.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.161 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It has glass
blue swirls colors in it.

00:25:44.161 --> 00:25:45.702 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There
you go. [LAUGHS]

00:25:45.702 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:47.154 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yay!

00:25:47.154 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's so funny.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.035 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's great.

00:25:49.035 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's the little
things that you pick up.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the remnants of things
that really mean a lot.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's wonderful.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I just got
to tell you, with her,

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.746 align:middle line:84%
she watches over
you all the time.

00:25:56.746 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I know.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.401 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: The month of May
would mean something, please.

00:26:00.401 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:84%
What's the significance
to May, M-A-Y?

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I think
that's when she passed on.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Passed over?

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:90%
That's her rebirth anniversary.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
know that this lady,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
she comes and
she's with sisters.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I gotta tell you.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She has
a lot of sisters.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Several sisters.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.025 align:middle line:84%
I think three that
I'm seeing here--

00:26:16.025 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Mm hmm.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
--right next to her.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And they all came together
to watch this happen.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Really?

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: They
all came together.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Because when one's
going to a party,

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:90%
they want to go to a party.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.859 align:middle line:84%
And when you come here
to the studio and,

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:28.275 align:middle line:84%
people that are
watching this, you

00:26:28.275 --> 00:26:29.941 align:middle line:84%
want to share it with
friends sometimes,

00:26:29.941 --> 00:26:31.367 align:middle line:90%
so you don't come here alone.

00:26:31.367 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
They come and share the
experience with you.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If one spirit comes in, they'll
bring family members, they'll

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
bring other people who might
think, wow, this is strange.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:90%
He can talk to us.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.142 align:middle line:90%
He can hear us.

00:26:40.142 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's wonderful.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.103 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So
that's what happens.

00:26:42.103 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Now would you have known about
yourself doing drawing work,

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:84%
drawing or artwork,
or when you were

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
a young girl you wanted
to do that, please?

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm
actually an artist.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You're an artist.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I paint.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.836 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And
she's in my room.

00:26:52.836 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%
I know she is.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.419 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, yeah.

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:90%
You think?

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:84%
You think you do
those things alone?

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.812 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:26:56.812 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] I know.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She's helping
you with drawing and doing

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:00.500 align:middle line:90%
the artwork.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that
she's in that room.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:03.890 align:middle line:90%
You bet she's in that room.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And behind me I see, like, a
bulletin board or something

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.150 align:middle line:90%
that you're hanging things up.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.805 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It's
my meditation altar.

00:27:09.805 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And it's in
that same room, correct?

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm sitting
there or in that space

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.775 align:middle line:84%
that she brings me to,
I know that behind me I

00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:90%
have some illustrations.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a Buddha,
obviously, meditation, I think.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's
something else there.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's flags or
colored types of illustrations.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.602 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It's my abstract
universal space paintings.

00:27:29.602 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, perfect,
like my stage here.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:32.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.774 align:middle line:84%
So I know that she's
also showing me

00:27:34.774 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
put your feet up.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.689 align:middle line:84%
Now do you have two
children at all?

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any children at all?

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have
two stepchildren--

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There we go.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: --but I have
three young dogs that--

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.937 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Nope.

00:27:43.937 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Living humans.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's the children.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.632 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:27:45.632 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:90%
So those are the two children.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So I know that sometimes--
she's giving me a sense

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.050 align:middle line:90%
here-- that you're being pulled.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:84%
You're being pulled to step
in as the mother figure,

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:90%
to step in.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And it goes really
against kind of what's

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.447 align:middle line:90%
going on with you, yes?

00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that you
don't like these kids.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.657 align:middle line:90%
But it's asking a lot for you.

00:28:04.657 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.989 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Can
we just say that?

00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that you need to
speak to hubby or your partner

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.362 align:middle line:84%
about this, and
just you really need

00:28:13.362 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
to be honest about
the whole thing.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.861 align:middle line:90%
It's like, you know what?

00:28:15.861 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:90%
We have to have balance here.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't be pulled in that
direction and that direction.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- and I don't mean
to be getting into your life.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:84%
But I'm nosy, so I will--
I know that there's

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.317 align:middle line:90%
a financial thing going on.

00:28:28.317 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know
because this lady's telling me

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that recently there was
a talk about finances,

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and more with one
than the other one.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Because one of them
is very independent

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and they can do things, but
the other one is a little bit

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
like I need a little
help with this.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I need the car payments.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:42.974 align:middle line:90%
I need the car thing.

00:28:42.974 --> 00:28:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I need to get settled.

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.098 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's so funny.

00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:84%
His car engine just broke down,
and he asked his dad for money

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:90%
to buy a new car.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Hello.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.437 align:middle line:90%
They know.

00:28:53.437 --> 00:28:54.291 align:middle line:90%
She knows.

00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's so weird
that she would even be a part

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well,
you know what it is?

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
something, a scenario,

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that's going on around
you in your atmosphere--

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's wild.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.718 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: --and she's able
to tell me that information

00:29:03.718 --> 00:29:05.880 align:middle line:84%
because she'll use what's
ever in my consciousness,

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:84%
what's ever in my atmosphere,
and obviously I've given people

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.290 align:middle line:90%
money for cars.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And so she will use what she
can light up in my atmosphere

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:15.580 align:middle line:84%
so I can give that
message to you.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And she's just projecting that.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So she's been around
you every day.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.370 align:middle line:90%
She's watching over you.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no death.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She's
a beautiful lady.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: They're
always around us.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.502 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful lady.

00:29:24.502 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know she
loves fresh flowers,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and I know you like to put the
fresh flowers in that room.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you
something, darling.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.906 align:middle line:84%
You need to change those
flowers in that room.

00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because she
said, yeah, they're stinky,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and they water's stinking.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.793 align:middle line:84%
You know, the water stinks
if you go in that room.

00:29:37.793 --> 00:29:38.781 align:middle line:90%
You know that, right?

00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's so funny.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.185 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Where did you
think you were coming today?

00:29:42.185 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I try to
be careful with it.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.743 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:29:44.743 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But she just said fresh
flowers are good for you.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that I like that for you.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Actually, as I'm
standing there with her,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
she shows me that if you
look now on the shelf

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
where these flowers are, it
looks like something fell down,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.450 align:middle line:84%
like a blossom, or
there's something

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that fell down in there,
that died and fell down.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hmm.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So when
you go home, look and see.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I will.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She
just told me that.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.726 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it just happened.

00:30:04.726 --> 00:30:05.682 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:05.682 --> 00:30:06.272 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:30:06.272 --> 00:30:08.355 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Can she help
me find my wedding ring?

00:30:08.355 --> 00:30:08.854 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:30:08.854 --> 00:30:12.092 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: [LAUGHS]
Well, something with you,

00:30:12.092 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:84%
you've been going through
old things, she said.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm hmm.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She said you've
been going through old things.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not sure if it's
a basement or an attic

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Everything.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But I know that you've
been going through stuff.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I know the garage must
have some boxes in there.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.903 align:middle line:84%
There's some place you've
been going through old things,

00:30:26.903 --> 00:30:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's what she says there.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.532 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:30:30.532 --> 00:30:31.740 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly where to look.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Good, good.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'll find it.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you're
going to find that.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.290 align:middle line:90%
It's in that house--

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Good.

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: --that
it's one of those boxes.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I know there's red writing
on the side of the box.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So look
for the red writing.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I will.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I think it
must have been when you moved

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:43.750 align:middle line:90%
or when you got into that space.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:90%
All right, darling?

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.733 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That was wonderful.

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I want to come
to you for just a second.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I know you have a
photo with you, don't you?

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned you had a photo.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Can I look at the photo?

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And let's try to connect
with spirit that way

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and see what miracles
we can come up with.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:90%
What is your name, sir?

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Harlen.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Harold?

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.163 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Harlen.

00:31:04.163 --> 00:31:06.044 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Harlen, H-A-R-L-E-N.

00:31:06.044 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, E-N.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And your dad's
passed over as well, hasn't he?

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.240 align:middle line:84%
As we connect, as I
connect into your space--

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and now, how I create this,
well, this miracle happens,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:84%
this messages, I will
connect into your space--

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and immediately, as I do,
behind you is your dad.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Did your dad come through
you in the exercise?

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel your
dad blend with you?

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, but
I thought about him.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
thought about him.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because he
was right in your space.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell
you that he's a nice guy.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:90%
He's a sweet guy.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.810 align:middle line:90%
He feels he was ignorant.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Me, too.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And he feels he
didn't know enough

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:39.400 align:middle line:84%
and he came out
of ignorance or he

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:84%
said things he didn't
mean to say to you.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know
there was a marriage thing he

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.229 align:middle line:90%
didn't agree with at one time.

00:31:46.229 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:90%
I know that, right?

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That partnership
he did not agree with at one

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.885 align:middle line:84%
time, and he's
apologizing for that.

00:31:50.885 --> 00:31:51.385 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:51.385 --> 00:31:52.135 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Good.

00:31:52.135 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I need
this space for this miracle

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.680 align:middle line:84%
to happen for him to
say I'm sorry to you.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's wearing a shirt,
and it's a small plaid shirt.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.525 align:middle line:84%
It's a small plaid shirt,
those little tiny plaids.

00:32:04.525 --> 00:32:06.160 align:middle line:90%
He used to love to wear those.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, he did.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mm hmm.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Because he shows me that
very, very clearly in my mind.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And so he wanted
you to know that you've got it

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.350 align:middle line:84%
all right and that he looks
to you for helping him.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is important you know
this and everyone knows this,

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that just because someone's
passed into the world of spirit

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:84%
does not mean they
have all the answers.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.880 align:middle line:84%
They learn many times from us
still down here on the Earth.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And can I just say-- and
I just can't tell you

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.568 align:middle line:84%
the amount of love I
feel from your dad--

00:32:28.568 --> 00:32:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that he really loves
you, and he was not

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.480 align:middle line:84%
able to tell you in the lifetime
but is able to tell you now.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.019 align:middle line:90%
He got you here today.

00:32:37.019 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
I know that you didn't
feel connected to your dad

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.811 align:middle line:84%
in the lifetime, but I know that
he feels connected to you now.

00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And he just wants me to
tell you that he's still

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:90%
a part of your life.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: He wasn't a
part of your life the last five

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:90%
years of his life.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.140 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:84%
You didn't speak
with him, or there

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:84%
was miscommunication
where you didn't speak.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And now he is.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.042 align:middle line:84%
Now he's a major
part of your life.

00:32:56.042 --> 00:32:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to please forgive him,

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:90%
because he's ready for that.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.790 align:middle line:90%
He's open.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.992 align:middle line:90%
He's not as judgmental.

00:33:02.992 --> 00:33:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you very much.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.527 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:05.527 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.537 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.080 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.690 align:middle line:90%
That was very moving.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.239 align:middle line:84%
That was really,
really touching.

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
tell you, thank you

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.250 align:middle line:90%
for making that miracle happen.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:18.827 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:33:18.827 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to go to
this lady right here.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if we
give her the microphone?

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.305 align:middle line:84%
Because she's sitting there,
and she's rubbing her belly.

00:33:25.305 --> 00:33:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Sorry,
I'm getting kicked.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
you're getting kicked?

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So this
is really, really--

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.560 align:middle line:90%
what is your name?

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Carly.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Carly.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.345 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So
Carly's pregnant.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.178 align:middle line:90%
Did you notice that?

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:34.865 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:34.865 --> 00:33:36.220 align:middle line:90%
So I just wanted to share this.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.886 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really,
really interesting.

00:33:37.886 --> 00:33:40.354 align:middle line:84%
Because people have asked
me, regarding pregnancy,

00:33:40.354 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
am I able to see that
spirit before they

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.826 align:middle line:90%
come into the physicality?

00:33:42.826 --> 00:33:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes,
I was wondering.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.665 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I knew
you had that question

00:33:44.665 --> 00:33:45.390 align:middle line:90%
because I'm psychic.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I knew you were
going to ask me that.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really,
really interesting one.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:84%
The make-up of that
soul, if you will,

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:84%
the soul make-up, before we
come back onto this Earth

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.290 align:middle line:84%
there is what we call a
connection, a meeting,

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.250 align:middle line:84%
if you will, with your
guides and your teachers

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
and your other soul
mates, family members who

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:04.930 align:middle line:90%
you've had other lifetimes with.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:05.532 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:05.532 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And you'll sit
before your counsel,

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
if you will, or
elders, and you will

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
go through what is the best
situations for my soul's

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:84%
What are the options for
me to learn and to grow

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
and for other soul mates
in my family unit to grow?

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So the soul agreement that you
have with that newborn baby,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:84%
there's a telepathic
connection that the mother

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:27.650 align:middle line:90%
has with that other soul.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you have
connected with your baby.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.982 align:middle line:84%
Because many times
I will do readings--

00:34:33.982 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and I've done it
on the show here--

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:84%
where I will connect with
that soul inside the mother

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and the conditions that
that soul is feeling

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.799 align:middle line:84%
from the mother, and
many, many times--

00:34:43.799 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and I know you'll know this-- as
the baby's in there and forming

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.622 align:middle line:84%
they'll have a telepathic
link with the mother.

00:34:49.622 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
you'll get a thought.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.769 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I better drink more
water, or, oh, I better

00:34:53.769 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:90%
take some vitamins.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden it just
comes to you, doesn't it?

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
that's that telepathic

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.306 align:middle line:84%
link with you and the
baby, the new baby.

00:35:02.306 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
that connection,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.102 align:middle line:84%
you have a soul connection,
so it's part of you, yes?

00:35:06.102 --> 00:35:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:08.643 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
you're part of that baby.

00:35:08.643 --> 00:35:11.284 align:middle line:84%
And the baby wants the best
for you and for itself to grow.

00:35:11.284 --> 00:35:11.783 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:11.783 --> 00:35:12.533 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:35:12.533 --> 00:35:13.701 align:middle line:90%
I hope I'm doing a good job.

00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You're doing
an outrageously great job.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:16.582 align:middle line:90%
First baby?

00:35:16.582 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have more.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.156 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:35:19.156 --> 00:35:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Now I know your
back is a little problematic

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a really
hard time with my back.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Well, I just see
the energy stuck in the back,

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.430 align:middle line:90%
the lower back here.

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm psychic, so I can see it.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.247 align:middle line:84%
But I would love
you to get a massage

00:35:31.247 --> 00:35:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to just move that
energy a little bit.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: A gentle massage.

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, the baby says.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.504 align:middle line:90%
And gently, gently.

00:35:36.504 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Now the baby--
this is very interesting.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Does the soul stay in that
body once the baby's born?

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.290 align:middle line:90%
No, it does not.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So the soul of that baby
goes in and out of that body.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, for instance,
it usually stays

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
in the body with you the last
trimester, so seven, eight,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
nine months it'll
usually stay in.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.190 align:middle line:84%
It gets used to feeling what
it's like to be in a body,

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.405 align:middle line:84%
and many times
it's like, oh, it's

00:35:58.405 --> 00:35:59.785 align:middle line:90%
so limiting being in that body.

00:35:59.785 --> 00:36:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But the last three months,
they got to kind of stay

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:02.810 align:middle line:90%
in that body.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And then once it's born, they
also go in and out of the body.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And usually the first three,
four months of the birth,

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.110 align:middle line:90%
they will go in and out.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
They'll go back and forth
into the physical body.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And what is the place?

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.060 align:middle line:90%
How do they leave?

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:19.017 align:middle line:84%
The top of the
head, the soft spot.

00:36:19.017 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The soft spot, the last
thing to come together.

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
that's how they leave.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, when we pass away

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:84%
at the end of our lives here,
we leave out of the crown also.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:90%
We leave that way.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.809 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So this is
the exit and entrance point.

00:36:31.809 --> 00:36:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Now isn't that wild?

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.434 align:middle line:90%
So I have an exercise for you.

00:36:34.434 --> 00:36:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So
when you go home,

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.301 align:middle line:84%
after you get your massage,
I want you just to sit down

00:36:38.301 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:84%
and be quiet, put yourself
into a quiet space,

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and start writing down a letter
and let the baby speak to you.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Let
the baby speak to you,

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and just start
writing things down.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:90%
You will be shocked.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.160 align:middle line:90%
You will be surprised.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.230 align:middle line:84%
You will be amazed at
what comes through.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.717 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna cry.

00:36:55.717 --> 00:36:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Any time I get this stuff,
when I recognize truth,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.090 align:middle line:90%
it comes, I start crying.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.510 align:middle line:90%
See, you're feeling it too?

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Anybody at home, if
you're pregnant, do this.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is I want
you to write that down,

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.939 align:middle line:90%
and you'll feel when to stop.

00:37:10.939 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Then you just fold it up.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.255 align:middle line:90%
Put it away until the baby's 21.

00:37:14.255 --> 00:37:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Happy birthday.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.001 align:middle line:90%
You want to do that?

00:37:19.001 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Good girl.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.895 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have a great baby.

00:37:21.895 --> 00:37:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:22.675 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Congratulations.

00:37:22.675 --> 00:37:23.633 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:23.633 --> 00:37:27.864 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.864 --> 00:37:29.109 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
interesting that we

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.680 align:middle line:84%
end this show with a
miracle, a birth, yes?

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So today's theme is miracles,
and there's a beautiful miracle

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:90%
that happens every day, birth.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.150 align:middle line:84%
The most amazing miracle,
created out of love, yeah?

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Two lights come together.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Chromosome means light.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So light comes together from
two parents and create one.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all very,
very much for being here

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.520 align:middle line:84%
today, and thank you
very much at home.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And until we meet next
time, may the love and light

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.737 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit
world surround you.

00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.710 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:90%
