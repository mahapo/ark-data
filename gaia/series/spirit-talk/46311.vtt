00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, world-renowned
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.566 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hey, everyone.

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, how are you?

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:90%
Hello, everyone.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.852 align:middle line:90%
Thank you joining me.

00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to
"Spirit Talk," where

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I take you one step
closer to heaven.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
joining us today,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and we have a studio audience.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:90%
A lovely studio audience.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I like smiles.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:90%
You're not dead.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%
You're alive.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.985 align:middle line:84%
The dead are more alive
than the living sometimes.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Each time we get
together, I like

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to talk about different
types of topics.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.286 align:middle line:84%
And I thought today, we'd talk
a little bit about energy.

00:00:58.286 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Because people often
talk about energy.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%
What is energy?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
People are not aware
sometimes what energy is.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, for my
definition of energy,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that energy
basically are molecules

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that move at a
certain rate of speed.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:90%
We're all made of energy.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.937 align:middle line:84%
Every single one
of us is energy.

00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And we vibrate a
certain rate of speed

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
in this three-dimensional world.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:90%
So, the physical body.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:90%
The chairs we're sitting in.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:90%
The houses we live in.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It's all vibrating or
moving at a certain speed.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:90%
So that is it.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
We are also spirits having
a human experience, not

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.464 align:middle line:90%
the other way around.

00:01:30.464 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So just think about that
for a couple moments.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
We are spirits, and we're
having a human experience,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So, how you choose
to look at the life

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
around you should really be
from a spiritual point of view.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look into the
human perspective of things,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
you kind of muck
things up a little.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that this is our
schoolroom down here.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
as all of us know,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.896 align:middle line:90%
life is a series of choices.

00:01:56.896 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it is.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So for people at home, and
also you in the audience,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:84%
I will do something with you
really kind of cool today.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Working with energy,
I'm going to talk

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.087 align:middle line:90%
about auras a little bit.

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about
how to read an aura,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
how to read energy
from a person.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
I think it's pretty cool.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.006 align:middle line:90%
Are you with me?

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.488 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can
do this, too, at home.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So, I really want
you to, if you could

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes
for just a second.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to go
back into your life and just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
kind of replay
various experiences.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Very strong moments
of your life.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.435 align:middle line:84%
Decisions that you had
to make, such as where

00:02:30.435 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
you went to school, perhaps.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
What job you decided
to go into, a career.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.795 align:middle line:10%
If you decided to
partner with somebody.

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:10%
Where you decided to live.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, those important
choices in your life which you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
decided.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to
be just very objective.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.885 align:middle line:84%
As you look at these
choices, I want you to see--

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not judging,
I'm being objective--

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
did you make that choice based
upon what other people thought

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:90%
of you?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:90%
What society thought of you?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
What you thought other
people think of you?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Or did you do it
out of love of it?

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, I want
to be an artist.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.139 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't pay well, but
I feel that within me, I

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:90%
got to do this art.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.770 align:middle line:90%
I got to be true to myself.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I got to be true
to my soul nature.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So just look at it in
a non-judgmental way.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Just objectively.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And just look at your life.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it's always good to
have an assessment of your life,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
to see where you've
come thus far.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Hard to move onto
the future if you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:84%
don't know where
you are right now.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Now open your eyes.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:90%
Bring yourself to present day.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.689 align:middle line:84%
How many people
chose because they

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
cared about what other
people thought about them?

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Fearful.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Fearing what people
thought about you.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
How many people thought
about maybe financially?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Money, this sort of thing, not
having enough money, anyone?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.439 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of us, and
most people that are out there,

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
have chosen their life,
made the choices in life,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:90%
based upon fear.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:90%
Based upon fear.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:90%
Not feeling empowered.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Not feeling you have a choice.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.426 align:middle line:84%
This is the way it has
to be, instead of love.

00:04:11.426 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many of us
fall into the programming

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
of, I would say, adults,
sometimes our parents,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.649 align:middle line:90%
sometimes society.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And our egos get caught up
in that fear instead of love.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is in life.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.366 align:middle line:90%
Love and fear.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
your life, it's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:84%
all your choices were
based upon love or fear.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you're a spirit
having a human experience.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:90%
You're not the ego.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.650 align:middle line:90%
What does fear mean?

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
F-E-A-R. False ego
appearing real.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.047 align:middle line:90%
False ego appearing real.

00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:49.505 align:middle line:84%
And we get so caught
up in the ego,

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.961 align:middle line:84%
and we get so caught up
in that fear-based stuff.

00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And we want people to love us.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And if we do this
thing over here,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:90%
they'll love us even more.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
We got to be true
to our soul nature.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And our soul nature is love.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Every single person here is God.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Every single one is that
beautiful, divine spark

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your background
is, and I'm just

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
going to keep it very
simple, that you are God.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Every single person is
that beautiful light.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.130 align:middle line:90%
And God is about creation.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:90%
God creates.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
The word love, the energy of
love, that word, the vibration,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and the word God are the
exact same vibration.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:90%
The exact same frequency.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you're living
your soul nature,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:90%
you're living in your God self.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
You're living in that
loving being self.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
When you live in fear, and you
let the ego get in the way,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:84%
you're not being
true to your nature.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:90%
True, yes?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.585 align:middle line:90%
Amen to that?

00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:48.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's really, really true.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And we get so
caught up sometimes

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
in what other
people think of us.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.475 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't do that,
because we're not

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
being true to ourselves.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And we also get caught up
on other people's-- we have

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:90%
to live by conditions.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Conditions,
conditions, conditions.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I often say,
you know F-E-A-R,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:90%
false ego appearing real.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And love is our
natural God self.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And I really think the more we
tune ourselves into that God

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
behavior, that rhythm, that
resonation with that God self,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:90%
it's true.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
How many people
raised their hand

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
before when I said your
expectation of other people,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:90%
you lived for other people.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:90%
How many?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Probably all of us at
some time in our life.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Can I just share with you
something really basic

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit
world has told me?

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
You can never live up to other
people's expectations of you.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
No one will ever
love you the most

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:90%
that you can love yourself.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.567 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.775 align:middle line:84%
And it's really,
really important

00:06:46.775 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to know energetically,
energetically,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that what other people think of
you is none of your business.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:90%
We like that one too.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.807 align:middle line:90%
An amen on that.

00:06:57.807 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:84%
What other people think of
you is none of your business.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody knows you
better than you know yourself.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows you better
than you know yourself.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's really, really
important that you know that.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So if anything you take from
today in watching this today,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
you really want to take the
sense of, I'm am my God self,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:90%
my soul self.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Whatever that means for you.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm creation.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:90%
God is creation.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not talking religious.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking about
who you are as an energy.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:90%
And that that is what's real.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have to acknowledge that
God within every single person

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
because every single
person has that light.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you can acknowledge that
God light within every person,

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
you're in.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
You're spiritually
moving up that ladder.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But when we let falsehood,
fear, and limitation

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.716 align:middle line:84%
get in the way of that creative
energy, it pushes us down.

00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's not our
natural environment.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not our natural energy.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:90%
So now, we're about energy.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to do another
experiment with you.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
feel what energy is.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So I would like for you to
hold your hands like this.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And just close your eyes.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you,
please, to become mindful.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:84%
To become aware of the
space in between your palms.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you become aware of that
space in between your palms,

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I just want you in your mind
to characterize that space,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:90%
just to feel that space.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge that space
any way you want to.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel
like temperature-wise?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.314 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel
like-- is there

00:08:25.314 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:90%
a sensation in your hands?

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you want to do is fine.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Just characterize,
acknowledge that space,

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:34.209 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
say own that space.

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
And you're very familiar what
that space feels like now.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.479 align:middle line:84%
Now very slowly,
I would like you

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to bring your hands
closer together.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Very slowly, bring
them closer together.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And as you bring
them closer together,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
I want you become aware
of how that space changes,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and what does it feel like as
you bring the palms closer?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Warm.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Tingling sensation anybody?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.309 align:middle line:90%
Tingling.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Tingling sensation.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So just go close
enough 'til you all

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.155 align:middle line:90%
feel that there's a sensation.

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can play with
that like an accordion.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Just feel how far out.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:90%
That's energy folks.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:90%
That's what energy is.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.485 align:middle line:84%
You can feel how far
out the energy goes.

00:09:15.485 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Now because we're humans,
we're on this three-dimensional

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.446 align:middle line:90%
level, this will appeal to us.

00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's very
tangible, that we can actually

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.664 align:middle line:90%
feel it.

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'd like
you to do is I'd

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
like you to take those hands
and turn them to your head right

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Your third eye center.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the
energy coming out

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.894 align:middle line:84%
of your third eye, which is
this site of clairvoyance.

00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Just feel the difference
in that energy.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
What that feel like,
it's very subtle.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Feel the subtlety.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:90%
The difference.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.486 align:middle line:84%
Now bring it down
to your throat.

00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
energy center.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to feel
the difference in that.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel the subtlety?

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.985 align:middle line:90%
That's wild, right?

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Now down to your heart.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Now that feels very
different, doesn't it?

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Very, very different.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
Now if you go down
to your solar plexus,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
which is your
psychic center, which

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:90%
is the seat of knowingness.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:90%
This is your truth right here.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.947 align:middle line:90%
This is you're gut.

00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:90%
You know go with your gut?

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:90%
That's where that comes from.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Now put your hands down.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:90%
What did you think?

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.912 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, yes?

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Very, very interesting.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.512 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good, good.

00:10:24.512 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's just so you at
home can learn about energy,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and just tuning into energy,
and different frequencies

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of the energy in the body.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.072 align:middle line:90%
That's really great.

00:10:31.072 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to
do now is I'd like

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
to do some questions and
answers in the audience,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and just ask you if you
have any general questions

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
or answers you'd
like to ask, and I

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:90%
will try to answer them for you.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.016 align:middle line:90%
Anything you'd like to ask?

00:10:44.016 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Not how is my dead Aunt
Millie, because we'll

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.396 align:middle line:90%
get to that in a second.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.677 align:middle line:90%
Anything over here?

00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Animals?

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Animals.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Is there a microphone?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Ask that question.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.087 align:middle line:84%
Because what you
say here may help

00:10:55.087 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
people that are
watching this as well.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.128 align:middle line:84%
And they might have a question
that you're asking for them.

00:10:59.128 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So, she's psychically
connecting with you.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Your question is about animals.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.407 align:middle line:90%
What exactly is the question?

00:11:06.407 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And hold the microphone
close to your mouth.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Do they
go to the same--

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You want to
know if animals survive death?

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Do they go to the
same place where people go?

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:90%
So animals survive death.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Animals, it's so funny.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I heard that
animals don't have souls.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, they don't have souls?

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:90%
That's so far from truth.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hello.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.890 align:middle line:90%
They're pure energy.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:90%
They are purest of energy.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Complete healers, animals.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Animals are our teachers
of unconditional love.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what they are.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hello.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:90%
You kick a dog, what happens?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
They come back and
lick your hand.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:90%
So animals survive death.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
They're fine.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're really, they're
all around us all the time.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And they meet us again
when we pass over

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:90%
to their side of life.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:90%
They will be there for us.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
They come with all of our
friends and family members.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And they also will indeed be
there for us when we pass over.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:90%
So animals are always there.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to
do now is I would

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
like to do for you what I call
a soul reading, in that it's

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.767 align:middle line:90%
a soul to soul reading.

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to do
is tune into your energy.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:02.558 align:middle line:90%
Into your energy.

00:12:02.558 --> 00:12:04.922 align:middle line:84%
So I want to have
someone come up on stage.

00:12:04.922 --> 00:12:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tune
into your energy

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and tell you something about
yourself, which you probably

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.765 align:middle line:84%
And some people call
it reading the aura,

00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to call
it reading your energy,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:90%
or reading your soul.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's gotta be somebody who
knows about their childhood

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:90%
and being raised.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So anybody want--
I want to get you.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:90%
I like your energy.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:90%
You up front.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.992 align:middle line:90%
Come on up, honey.

00:12:25.992 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Kale.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Kale.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
How are you, darling?

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good, good, good.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:90%
So let's see what happens.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.683 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to turn over this way.

00:12:31.683 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move you over here.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.075 align:middle line:90%
Just follow me.

00:12:34.075 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:90%
You go before me.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Turn here.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you
to do is I just

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.742 align:middle line:90%
want you to close your eyes.

00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to read for you.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to read your energy

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.618 align:middle line:90%
and just see what's going on.

00:12:42.618 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
As I tune into your
soul here, I know

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that around the age of
eight and nine years of age,

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.624 align:middle line:84%
that there is a beginning to get
your creative spark about you.

00:12:49.624 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And people in
your family recognized that.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.204 align:middle line:84%
Your mother also recognized
that very strongly.

00:12:54.204 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Also there would
be an aunt around that family.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
There'd been another woman
there, helping to raise--

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.471 align:middle line:84%
Because she'd be
very, very influential

00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
in the raising of the family,
and raising of the kids.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.806 align:middle line:84%
Because I know around that age,
the chronicle age of 9, 10,

00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:84%
it would be very, very
difficult for your mom

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:90%
to cope with some things.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.915 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I also
know that at a soul level,

00:13:15.915 --> 00:13:17.540 align:middle line:84%
you stick out from
your other siblings.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
You really do, you stick
out from your siblings.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.963 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:13:19.963 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.358 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:13:21.358 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So around 10, 11
years of age here,

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I want
to run away, or I

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:84%
feel like I want to
escape, or I want

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:90%
to get back to my own self.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.421 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that you

00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
would have spent sometimes
away from the home.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also want to ask
you around the age--

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to up
to 18 years of age.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm 18 years of age.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if there
was someone in your family

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
who almost died, or there's
a close call in death

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that happened right
around that time?

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Someone did die.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I know in the soul
level, and as a look at that,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
around the chronical age
of around 18 years of age,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.200 align:middle line:84%
there's a trauma to
your heart in that

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:90%
it's an emotional trauma.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a loss.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So it might be a
relative, or a--

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, my grandmother.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Around 21
years of age, I'm gone,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.327 align:middle line:90%
or I'm going somewhere.

00:14:02.327 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going somewhere.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, gone.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also wanna
ask around the time of age,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you have a
love of painting or artwork

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:90%
that comes to you.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a painter.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're a painter.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.293 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:14:11.293 --> 00:14:14.284 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that around
the age of 21 years of age,

00:14:14.284 --> 00:14:15.825 align:middle line:84%
that starts flourishing
in your soul.

00:14:15.825 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.856 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So I know by the age of
22, 23, that I own that.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.870 align:middle line:84%
That I own my abilities,
my creative spark.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I own my creative
abilities, and I'm

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.394 align:middle line:84%
stepping into my own
power with my creativity.

00:14:28.394 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that around 23 years of age

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to 25, 26, you
would have changed

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.267 align:middle line:84%
the style of the
artwork that you do.

00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:90%
You'd have changed the painting.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
You've changed
either how it looks.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And it would have
been more free flow.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And that would have happened
probably around 26, 27.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.568 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:48.374 align:middle line:84%
So I also know around that
time, the back area here

00:14:48.374 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:90%
starts giving you out.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I know it's generational.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.724 align:middle line:90%
I know it's heredity.

00:14:52.724 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's from
generations before,

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.970 align:middle line:90%
like two generations before.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I know there's been
arthritis in the back,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.224 align:middle line:84%
and this area here
starts bothering you.

00:15:00.224 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: An even to
this day, as I look here,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I see that the energy
is kind of blocked

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:90%
in that lower back area.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I know that-- now just turn
just slightly if you could.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to clear
that little energy

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:90%
from the bottom of that.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you have trouble
with support, you know?

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.477 align:middle line:90%
And people are plugged into you.

00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:90%
They're really plugged into you.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Now you're a sponge.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And you're an empath.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And this area right
here is the energy.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:24.741 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the energy.

00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:90%
It's stuck here a little bit.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So that might be something
you might feel here.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that
there's something not--

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.814 align:middle line:84%
do you have trouble
here with the neck area?

00:15:32.814 --> 00:15:35.354 align:middle line:84%
Because as I look at the energy
going down the spine, it gets

00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:37.057 align:middle line:84%
stuck here, and it
gets stuck here.

00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And over here, by the way.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:90%
And also knees.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:39.945 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:39.945 --> 00:15:40.107 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:15:40.107 --> 00:15:41.074 align:middle line:90%
You got them all.

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.444 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm just
reading your energy.

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:46.235 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, darling.

00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:48.921 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.921 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing, sweetheart?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:90%
I have your mom here.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good, good.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to bring
your microphone.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.087 align:middle line:90%
And your name is Cynthy--

00:15:56.087 --> 00:15:56.927 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cindy.

00:15:56.927 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cindy.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Good Cindy.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.255 align:middle line:84%
So I have your mother
and your grandfather.

00:16:03.255 --> 00:16:04.921 align:middle line:84%
Your mother's father
has also passed on.

00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:05.925 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that your mother

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:84%
is a very hardworking lady
when she was in the lifetime.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.296 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to connect with
her in the lifetime when she

00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
was in this life, she was
a very hardworking lady.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I feel like she really
came into this world,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:90%
and it was hard working.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I feel like when she was a young
girl, she had to be the adult.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And as she got older, maybe
she could be a bit younger.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But she really had
to be responsible

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
when she was younger,
she's telling me.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.086 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
there's-- right, right, right.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm right with you all the time.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.279 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking about your
looking at her handwriting.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that, please?

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you've
been looking at letters.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And you've been looking at
my hand, my script writing.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.348 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
when she was a younger lady,

00:16:45.348 --> 00:16:47.334 align:middle line:84%
she tends to want to
write letters, your mom.

00:16:47.334 --> 00:16:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you that I'm not

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
sure who it is that she's
writing letters to, but she is.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:90%
She is.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.889 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
your father as well.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Because you mentioned your dad.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Is he still down here on this
earth, or is he passed over?

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's passed.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
what I thought.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.559 align:middle line:90%
I thought so.

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I'm with
that gentleman over here.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have him on the
other side of her.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
And I have your
grandfather over here,

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
which would be your
mother's father.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I also got to tell you, your
mother gives me memories.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
So remember, spirits always
come back in memories.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking
about the swing set.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:90%
The swing set.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:84%
So if I go back childhood,
six, seven, like most kids,

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:84%
but there's swing set at
the back of the house.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that she remembers

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.394 align:middle line:84%
you being her little
helper cleaning the house.

00:17:26.394 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know I'm
dusting things with my mother.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my god.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
Saturday afternoon, she said.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Saturday afternoon was the time
we used to clean the house.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.857 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:34.857 --> 00:17:35.356 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:35.356 --> 00:17:35.945 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:38.236 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you really
did a great job with that.

00:17:38.236 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:10%
Now I know that I'm
seeing in front of me

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.732 align:middle line:10%
either a nurse's outfit--
does that make sense?

00:17:43.732 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:10%
Was that her the nurse,
or you the nurse?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Me.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:10%
Because she was talking
about this nurse.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.303 align:middle line:90%
She gives me the nurse's outfit.

00:17:50.303 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, do
you know how proud

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I am of you to wear
that nurse's outfit.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- and she's really
bragging about her daughter

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:57.389 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:17:57.389 --> 00:17:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, she's
full of compassion.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:10%
And you know, one of
your gifts, Cynthia,

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:10%
which you might not even
be aware of it, my love,

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:10%
is you are very compassionate
to other people.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:10%
You tend to see people at a
lower level who need help,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:10%
and your heart goes
right there to help them.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:10%
And that's an incredible asset.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:10%
That's you.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.368 align:middle line:10%
Are you a friend of hers?

00:18:16.368 --> 00:18:17.034 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:17.034 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I've known her all my life.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You've
known her your whole life.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Because she won't
speak for herself.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:21.615 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:18:21.615 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.236 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely.

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Great 100%.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.739 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:23.739 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you stand
too and join the party.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Because you're great energy.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:27.685 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:27.685 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:90%
So give her the microphone.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.108 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:18:31.108 --> 00:18:33.960 align:middle line:84%
She is probably the most
compassionate person

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.312 align:middle line:90%
I've ever met in my life, ever.

00:18:35.312 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.444 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware also the
animal kingdom loves you.

00:18:39.444 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very, very
aware you take strays.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's
talking to me about,

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
oh, she takes strays
in all the time.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.209 align:middle line:84%
Your mother said, you
hid some of them from me.

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you were a young
girl, a very young girl,

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.922 align:middle line:84%
there was definitely some
hiding of the babies.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Just a few.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very aware also, your
mother's showing me cooking.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'm cooking.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Making cookies with her.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.462 align:middle line:84%
And you're making
the cookies with her.

00:19:00.462 --> 00:19:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And they're very
strange cookies, by the way.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not your normal
kind of cookie.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know these ingredients.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
They're snickerdoodles, or
something weird, or walnuts.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.587 align:middle line:84%
Or it's like a combination
of these strange cookies.

00:19:10.587 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also very
aware that your father

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:90%
wants to give me his love.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And that your father
feels he wasn't

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.560 align:middle line:90%
as smart as he should have been.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel your father was
very critical of himself

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:90%
when he was in lifetime.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he was.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.985 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
feel like he always

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:84%
had to live up to other
people's expectations.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.614 align:middle line:84%
And I think he tried to live up
to his father's expectations.

00:19:28.614 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I think there
must've been a brother of his

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like,
I feel like he

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
had to live up to his
brother's expectations as well.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.491 align:middle line:84%
I also want to ask you,
who is the diabetic

00:19:36.491 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
who had to take the insulin?

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Where is the diabetes,
please, in that?

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.368 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her mother.

00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:42.327 align:middle line:90%
Who was my best friend.

00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was there recently
an episode with the diabetes,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
or did we have to
change the insulin?

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.916 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:46.916 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:84%
She was hospitalized
for pancreatitis.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.207 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:19:49.207 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Was that from the diabetes?

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.653 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They think so.

00:19:51.653 --> 00:19:54.217 align:middle line:84%
They weren't able to
pinpoint the exact reason,

00:19:54.217 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:90%
but they think that's why.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.182 align:middle line:84%
Because she also has
a deformed pancreas.

00:19:57.182 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, her mom and her father
are coming together here.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.642 align:middle line:84%
And her mother
must've known you.

00:20:03.642 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Her
mother knew my mother.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.175 align:middle line:84%
My mother and her have been
best friends since they were 11.

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she kind of knows you,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
this lady, when
she comes in here.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give you
the heart necklace.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you the
necklace with the heart.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:90%
So I'm giving that to you.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Your mom and dad are
giving that to you.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.171 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I want to talk also

00:20:20.171 --> 00:20:23.224 align:middle line:84%
about, your father seems
very quiet at times.

00:20:23.224 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very, very quiet.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But I got to tell
you, he's there

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
when the time comes
that he has to be there.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, always.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.665 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Always.

00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm
teaching you how

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.254 align:middle line:90%
to drive when we're younger.

00:20:34.254 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, absolutely.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
he comes back with that memory.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.031 align:middle line:10%
That he wants you to come
back with that memory of when

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:10%
he taught you how to drive.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.124 align:middle line:10%
And I know that
he's laughing now.

00:20:43.124 --> 00:20:44.540 align:middle line:10%
And he's saying,
thank you, James,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.762 align:middle line:10%
for being able to do this.

00:20:45.762 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:10%
And he's talking about--
and it's really pretty

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:10%
funny-- he said, she
almost hit a tree.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:50.909 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I don't know
what he's talking about, almost

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:90%
hitting a tree.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was a stick.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.475 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
it was a stick?

00:20:56.475 --> 00:20:56.976 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:56.976 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
what I learned

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.705 align:middle line:90%
to drive on, so, I probably did.

00:20:59.705 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:90%
I probably did.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me this
memory of that.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.758 align:middle line:84%
But I also got to tell you
while your mother's laughing now

00:21:04.758 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
when she's saying, thank you
for helping her when she passed.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
She's thanking you,
because you made

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
it really peaceful
for your mother.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And you really
helped her pass over.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.480 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, that's amazing.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that she

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:90%
must be lying down in the bed.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And she's very ill.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:10%
And she just feels like
she's just wasting away.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:10%
And she's telling me about
you putting the pillow up

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:10%
behind her, the extra
pillow there behind her.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.669 align:middle line:90%
And I know there's also lotion.

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
That you're putting
the lotion on her skin.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Understand that.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she makes me cry now.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.584 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.584 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:90%
I know, I know, she's great.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I know she's great.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:90%
You made up your mother's face.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:84%
You put makeup on her
to make her feel better.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.466 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:21:51.466 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that
little thing that you did

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:90%
made her feel better.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And she wasn't able to
tell you at the time.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But she wanted to tell you now,
that that made her feel better.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you that I really,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.900 align:middle line:90%
really-- I understand that.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.764 align:middle line:84%
You have her perfume, or
something about a perfume?

00:22:07.764 --> 00:22:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.983 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she said, I'm
there, and she has my perfume.

00:22:11.983 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I'm
known sometimes.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.165 align:middle line:84%
I'll come in the kitchen
and smell the perfume,

00:22:16.165 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's like a floral perfume.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, it's
me, it's me, it's me.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.304 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:22:21.304 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
do you remember

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.496 align:middle line:84%
when you were a little
girl, that the milk was

00:22:24.496 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:90%
delivered to the house.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.425 align:middle line:84%
There was someone that used to
deliver the milk in the family.

00:22:28.425 --> 00:22:30.925 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you-- and this
grandfather is talking to me,

00:22:30.925 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:90%
so it's him.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Did he do that sort of thing?

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that what that was?

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.664 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandfather
actually delivered milk.

00:22:36.664 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, that's it.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was years
and years and years.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I knew I was
hearing delivering milk.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's what he
spent his career doing, was

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.112 align:middle line:90%
delivering milk.

00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So he here's as well,
blending into over here.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.520 align:middle line:90%
And I love him.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:90%
He's before his time.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:90%
He's like, show people the way.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:55.754 align:middle line:90%
He's the light.

00:22:55.754 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
He can brighten
up a neighborhood.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Brighten up a room.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And he's fun, fun, fun.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:90%
And he's thanking your family.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.071 align:middle line:84%
He's all about thanking people
and being really appreciative.

00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you, this
man comes in with gratitude.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.869 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say, an
attitude of gratitude.

00:23:10.869 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
attitude of gratitude,

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:90%
then you learn humility.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this man
was all about humility.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was
in so many ways.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.295 align:middle line:84%
He was the light in
a lot of darkness.

00:23:25.295 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you know what I love,

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
which I really-- I'm
going to cry now.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:90%
The resonation, the energy.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about energy
and how it resonates.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
This lovely lady next to your
friend has a similar energy.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.681 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.605 align:middle line:84%
I talked to her,
and she helped me.

00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:90%
I've known her all my life.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And she's helped me
through that time

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
when my grandfather passed.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
you're soul mates.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
absolutely believe that.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And they reminded me both
so much of each other,

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
because they both
were so compassionate,

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and just when there's
so much darkness, both

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of them, my grandfather and
this wonderful woman next to me,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
have been the light.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Totally.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:03.514 align:middle line:90%
The same vibe.

00:24:03.514 --> 00:24:04.889 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
your grandfather,

00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and he reminds me of people
around my experience in life.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.925 align:middle line:84%
But he's someone who
doesn't judge anybody.

00:24:09.925 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.633 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He observed.

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:12.770 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't judge anybody.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:90%
He said everybody has a story.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.502 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has story.

00:24:16.502 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he would
have a book of poetry.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know he
used to love to read poetry.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:90%
He used to sit there and read.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.412 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the book
has brown covers on it.

00:24:24.412 --> 00:24:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know there
are poems in that.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Are you familiar with that?

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I am.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:90%
It was in his bedroom.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.525 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:24:30.525 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And your mom and this
man get along famously.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.849 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:24:33.849 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And they
tell jokes to each other.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.313 align:middle line:90%
And he's not over the top.

00:24:37.313 --> 00:24:38.560 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
He's just very open to
different types of things,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:84%
like being here
in this audience.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And he would be like, well,
this is pretty interesting.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I've
seen him at night.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.875 align:middle line:84%
When my daughter was born, he
would make her toys go off.

00:24:48.875 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.251 align:middle line:90%
So he knows about this energy.

00:24:51.251 --> 00:24:51.958 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:90%
He was so playful.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So he would make
the toys go off.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:56.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd be like, hi, Grandpa.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:56.985 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:24:56.985 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's great.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You know,
and I've seen him.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:00.180 align:middle line:90%
I've seen him in the mirror.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.763 align:middle line:90%
I've seen him.

00:25:00.763 --> 00:25:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you know about
the house that had a porch?

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:03.956 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:03.956 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my--

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.045 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know he's
present at that porch.

00:25:08.045 --> 00:25:09.545 align:middle line:84%
I know we are sitting
on that porch,

00:25:09.545 --> 00:25:11.878 align:middle line:84%
and that we're all there, and
we're having a good family

00:25:11.878 --> 00:25:13.390 align:middle line:90%
time, and I really like that.

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I love the apple
trees, by the way.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I was a
little girl he used to--

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and he was a huge man.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:90%
He's a huge man.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Huge hands.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And what he used to do
is take the leaves off

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
of the tree, and July 4, put
it right here and go, pop.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And go, see?

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I make my own fireworks.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, that's great.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's why there's trees.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know one
was an apple tree,

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:84%
because he's showing
me apple trees.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that someone's climbing up.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's trying to
hold you up there.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:40.705 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you have that memory?

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.788 align:middle line:84%
Because they come back
in memories to me.

00:25:43.788 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's a memory.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.405 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
remember something.

00:25:46.405 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
In the spirit world,
there is no time.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.710 align:middle line:90%
We're outside of time.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.105 align:middle line:84%
So we only make memories
here in the physical earth.

00:25:52.105 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the
spirit side of life,

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.609 align:middle line:84%
we look back at the
memories we created.

00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they come back
to communicate, come back

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to this space, they will
talk about the memories

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:00.775 align:middle line:90%
that are very real to them.

00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:02.691 align:middle line:84%
It's like a photograph
album, and they'll look

00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and they'll see what's
very, very real.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:90%
I give you his love so much.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.515 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I give
you your Mom's love,

00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and your grandpa,
and your dad also.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is our
schoolroom down here.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Earth is our schoolroom.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And we come here to
learn many, many lessons.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And the quickest way to
get to the top of the class

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:90%
is compassion.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.796 align:middle line:84%
Is love, and compassion,
and seeing that God

00:26:23.796 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:90%
within everybody, which do.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:90%
So spread the light.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.039 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:27.955 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:27.955 --> 00:26:31.217 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:31.217 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I really feel
like I want to go over here.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:90%
[SPITTING SOUND]

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.748 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go
to this lady here.

00:26:35.748 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Woot.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.067 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
a man that comes in here.

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Because as I've been
standing up here,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.930 align:middle line:84%
there's a man jumping up,
jumping up, jumping up.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know it'd be
a connection to you.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know there would have
been a ring, because I'm

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:47.112 align:middle line:90%
seeing a ring.

00:26:47.112 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So it would have
been a connection.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:90%
A marriage or a partnership.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:90%
So would that make sense?

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:53.466 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a man
that passed over

00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that you had a heart
connection with at one time?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Your ex-husband.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.890 align:middle line:90%
That works for me.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.005 align:middle line:84%
Now, I got to tell you
that this man, I feel like,

00:27:02.005 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I'm getting
a C initial for some reason.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.337 align:middle line:90%
But I have a C initial here.

00:27:06.337 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
got chilly willies.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
got chilly willies?

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.446 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:09.446 --> 00:27:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering if
it's my son, Ben.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:90%
His last name was Chic.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Chic with a C?

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.646 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:16.646 --> 00:27:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:90%
So, two separate people.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:23.278 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:23.278 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Two separate people.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.375 align:middle line:84%
There's a man here who you
would have known emotionally

00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:84%
that would have been
connected to your heart.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
That you would have
been married to,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.575 align:middle line:84%
there would have
been connection.

00:27:30.575 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Would you know anything
about Hawaii at one time?

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Tell
me about that.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Did you go to Hawaii?

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Or was there some visit
or something with Hawaii?

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I took my
sons, which is his sons

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.052 align:middle line:84%
and their wives to Hawaii, and
it was for my 50th birthday.

00:27:48.052 --> 00:27:48.916 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hello?

00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there's
a connection there, yeah?

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
there are memories of Hawaii.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a son
that passed over

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.280 align:middle line:90%
that went to Hawaii as well?

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, but my
son's best friend Ben

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.804 align:middle line:84%
passed, and they were
in the car together.

00:28:03.804 --> 00:28:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This man
is coming in and saying

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.517 align:middle line:84%
that your son still has his
phone number on his cell phone.

00:28:08.517 --> 00:28:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I wouldn't doubt it.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know it.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:90%
So I know that that's there.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I know that recently, your son
would have looked at that name

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.037 align:middle line:84%
and looked at his best
friend's phone number,

00:28:20.037 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and he would have
thought, should I keep it,

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:90%
or what should I do with that?

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't they have gone
to the mountains some time

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.875 align:middle line:84%
and gone hiking, or
gone bicycling as well?

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Chilly
willies again.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Elk hunting.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes or no?

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Elk hunting.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:90%
That's all we got, a yes or no.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
he's giving me.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.663 align:middle line:84%
He's filling me with
that information.

00:28:37.663 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:84%
That we, my best
friend, we would

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
have memories of doing
that on the bikes.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.424 align:middle line:90%
On the bikes.

00:28:43.424 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:90%
So I'm just being told that.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
So bring this
information to your son.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:52.502 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know that
he sees him on the bed crying.

00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want to admit
it to anybody, your son.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:90%
But he knows that he cries.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.360 align:middle line:84%
That in his mind, he's
thinking about him.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.319 align:middle line:90%
And he does love him.

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:90%
He loves him.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:90%
He loves him.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.941 align:middle line:90%
One more thing.

00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, this boy doesn't
want to take up the time,

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.374 align:middle line:84%
he said to me, but he wants
your son to know he's OK.

00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.164 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And do
you know if your son has

00:29:13.164 --> 00:29:15.954 align:middle line:84%
like, a neckerchief
that belonged to him?

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.410 align:middle line:90%
He's telling me that.

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:20.702 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:20.702 --> 00:29:21.618 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:21.618 --> 00:29:27.670 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Woo.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do this
work, I thank you very much.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for the
connection to the spirit world,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.930 align:middle line:84%
and when we talk to
spirit, it really

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:84%
does amount to the
energy that you give out,

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:84%
the energy that you
set up this room with,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and the atmosphere that you
create with your thoughts.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's really your thoughts.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's your
openness, if you will.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:50.070 align:middle line:84%
The energy that you produce,
that you're open with,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.600 align:middle line:84%
will really give the
forum for the spirit world

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.311 align:middle line:90%
to come so, so close to you.

00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And they can be a
part of your life.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
They are a part of your
life every single day.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Remember, your
thoughts are things.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are real.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
very, very respectful

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and responsible for the
thoughts that you have.

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the spirits see
your thoughts all the time.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.360 align:middle line:84%
They know exactly
what you're thinking.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:84%
They see you as this mental
energy very, very much so.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So I would be careful
of your thoughts.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Because they're watching you.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.779 align:middle line:84%
So please be careful of
your thoughts, you guys.

00:30:22.779 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And I hope everything's
good for you,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.572 align:middle line:90%
and thank you all very much.

00:30:25.572 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of you at home
that are watching,

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you also.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.354 align:middle line:84%
And may the light of
spirit surround you.

00:30:31.354 --> 00:30:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Love and light
always be with you.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you until next time.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:90%
