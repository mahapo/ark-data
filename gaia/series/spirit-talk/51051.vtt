>>ANNOUNCER: And
now, world renowned

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:90%
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.514 align:middle line:90%
And thank you.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much for joining us

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.096 align:middle line:84%
for another episode of
Spirit Talk, where I take you

00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:52.654 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had that
feeling that you met somebody

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:90%
that you've known them before.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
There's an uncanny feeling
of I'm aware of this person.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I know them from the inside out.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you've been to a
certain place, certain city,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and you feel like you've
been there before.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.575 align:middle line:84%
Or you've had a deja vu feeling,
like you've had this experience

00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and I know what's
going to happen here.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you've
heard these cases

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
where there are children who
speak to their parents and say,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
mommy, in the last
life I was the father

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.699 align:middle line:90%
and you were the child.

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard of those.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So this is what
we're calling reincarnation.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:90%
It's known as reincarnation.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And reincarnation has
been for, of course,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:84%
centuries and centuries
and centuries.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Reincarnation is
a belief that we

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.010 align:middle line:84%
are souls-- we are soul
beings-- and we come back

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:90%
in different lifetimes.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And the soul comes back into
the shell body, the human body,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:90%
and that's called incarnation.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.816 align:middle line:90%
Having an incarnation.

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:90%
So we reincarnate.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
We come back over, and over,
and over, and over again.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that
as soul beings, when

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
we get to the other side
of life, what happens

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
is we meet with our guides, we
meet with our spirit teachers,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:84%
our counselors,
and we really will

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.000 align:middle line:84%
sit down and prepare
for another lifetime.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
We will look in this
past life we just had

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and review it and see
all the soul lessons

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that we learned, whether
those lessons might have been

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
about forgiveness, or
compassion, or understanding.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there was also
some karmic obligations

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
we had with another family
member, with a friend,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:90%
with a partner.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:90%
We all know about those, right?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what's going on here?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Jeez.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.412 align:middle line:84%
So we work these things
out in each lifetime.

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So we'll sit with our
guides and teachers

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and we'll really kind
of map out our agenda

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:90%
for the next lifetime.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And we'll put ourselves
in various situations

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and certain events
will happen in order

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.510 align:middle line:84%
for us to really learn and
to grow and be involved

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.995 align:middle line:84%
in that experience about
patience or about forgiveness

00:02:45.995 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
or about caring or
about loving yourself.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:90%
So reincarnation you perfect.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You get better and better and
you understand the lesson more

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
experiences we have,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:90%
the more evolved we become.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.669 align:middle line:84%
So when we come back in
the different lifetimes,

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
we will come back
with the same souls

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that we've shared
other lifetimes with.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And just like Shakespeare
said, the world is a stage

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're merely
players upon it.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So we do take on these
different, if you will,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
characters.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:84%
In one lifetime
we'll be a mother.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
In one lifetime
we'll be the father.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Another time we'll be the child.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Another time we'll
be in a situation

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:90%
where let's say we're adopted.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Another time we'll be
very, very wealthy.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Another time we'll
be very, very poor.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
One lifetime we'll
be maybe Chinese.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
One time we'll be African.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
One time we'll be European.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:90%
It all depends.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on experiences.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So you will put
yourself-- your soul will

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.825 align:middle line:84%
take on this appearance,
will take on this situation

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to
go through in order

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to learn the most
it can for itself.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, really
important to know that.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.685 align:middle line:84%
And people think
that, many times,

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's linear--
you know, everything

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:90%
is linear-- which it is.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.810 align:middle line:84%
This three dimensional
world is a linear world.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in the spirit
world, there is no time.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.021 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as time.

00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you are on
the other side of life

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and you look at your
past life you just had,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:84%
you will begin to
see all of those

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
as if they're all
happening at the same time.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And the future lives, as well.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
Not just past lives
but future lives.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not an expert
in quantum physics,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:90%
but I will tell you this.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I know enough that your
soul right now that what you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.980 align:middle line:84%
create with your thoughts
and with your words

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and with your
actions will really

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
help to perfect you
in this lifetime

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and will help to,
if you will, correct

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
past experiences
in other lifetimes.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, isn't that interesting.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.511 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So in
this lifetime let's say

00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:90%
you're-- yeah.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I can see a teacher around you.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Like a teacher spirit,
like a teacher energy.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Like I feel like-- here we
go-- I feel like with you

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:84%
in a past life, you could have
been into teaching, academics,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:90%
understanding things, a writer.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
All these like
working with words.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I would know
that this lifetime,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
you came back in this lifetime,
really to express yourself

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:90%
with words.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.093 align:middle line:84%
And really it would be a
lifetime for you of expression.

00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:09.047 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:10.005 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.826 align:middle line:84%
Because I see that with
the colors around you.

00:05:12.826 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
soul chose this lifetime.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting,
because in this present time,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
as I said, we are a summation
of all the other lifetimes.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you
are exactly what

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
you were in the past
in that everything

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
you are right now, you created
based upon your actions

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
from the past, your
thoughts from the past,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and what you did in the past.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can't blame
anybody else but yourself.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.002 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So like me, for instance,
so I'm a spiritual medium.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I know myself as far
as past lives goes,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
that I was definitely
involved in mysticism

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:90%
for many, many lifetimes.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I was a monk.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I was a priest, a monk,
a different priest.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:90%
I was a Tibetan monk.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I was all different
types of disciplines.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I really had to perfect and
work at and understand, and go

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:84%
through, and express
in order, I believe,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:90%
to have that full understanding.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So in this current
lifetime I can come back

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and do this work with spirit.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Interesting?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
It's just so interesting.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And this journey
of discovery I find

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is so fascinating
of the soul and why

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
we do certain things, why
we like certain people, why

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:84%
we don't like other people, why
we like certain places to live,

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.405 align:middle line:84%
why we don't like
other places to live.

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's all pretty interesting.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
we go into that self

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
discovery of our souls, we
understand ourselves better.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to
do with you today

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:90%
is to do a past life regression.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Have any of you ever
done that before?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll be very,
very interesting.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you don't think
so much and just experience

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
what happens and let
your soul speak to you.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And I will help you,
I will guide you

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:90%
through a past life regression.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to ask you
to do is close your eyes.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And you at home also,
you can close your eyes

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and just listen to my voice
and the music behind it.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.397 align:middle line:84%
It really is a matter of
where you place your mind.

00:07:07.397 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's always great when we
do this type of soul work, which

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is really what I
like to call it.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It's really going to place of
neutrality, being very neutral

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and letting the mind
just drift-- just drift.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
If you have a hard
time just drifting,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
you can always come back
to the sound of my voice.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.315 align:middle line:84%
And I will be there to guide you
and protect you and help you.

00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:90%
So do not worry.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Nothing harmful.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very,
very healthy to do this.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:90%
And you're in good hands.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.854 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit in your
chairs-- and you at home sit

00:07:37.854 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
in your chairs or
lie down, that's

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.020 align:middle line:84%
fine-- just be
mindful of the body.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of how the feet
feel on the floor, legs,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.636 align:middle line:84%
your backs on the chairs,
your shoulders and your arms,

00:07:51.636 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:90%
your neck, your head.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful of the
physical body, which is really

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
the storage for your
soul in this lifetime.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And just acknowledge that body
with an attitude of gratitude.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Attitude of gratitude.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important that you

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
send that message out to the
universe and spirit realms

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that you are indeed are honored
to have this physical body

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:90%
knowing this is an opportunity.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit in
your chairs there,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:84%
just be mindful
now of the breath.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:90%
The breath is a gift from God.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
For with the breath,
it sustains our life.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like for you to imagine
as you inhale through our nose

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful golden
light coming down

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
through the top of the head,
into the body, illuminating

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
every cell, every
muscle, and every organ.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale
out of your mouth,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
we can imagine a
gray mist, which

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
represents any old,
stagnant energy

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of the body, any old
belief systems, any fears,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
any limitations,
because we create

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:90%
so much of that in this life.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So together let's bring in
that beautiful golden light

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the head.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:90%
And that beautiful God light.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And inhale and hold it--
two, three, four, and exhale.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.953 align:middle line:90%
Grey mist out of your mouth.

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And again.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And hold it-- two,
three, four, and exhale.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It's a great
opportunity for you.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.707 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:36.707 --> 00:09:38.615 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:09:38.615 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Listening to my
voice as I guide you.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And one more time.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Now you're relaxing.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Envision this beautiful,
celestial golden light

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:84%
entering the top of
the head into the body

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and bathing the entire
interior of your body

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:90%
with God's golden light.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Hold it-- two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.742 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.134 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:10:10.134 --> 00:10:11.491 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And now in your mind's eye,
staying in that very neutral

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
space, I would like
for you to imagine

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.225 align:middle line:84%
that there is a screen above
your head in front of you.

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Just find any way you
want to create that.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And on this screen there
are three distinct doors.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And you can create those
doors anyway you like.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:90%
They could be ornate.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:90%
They could be simple.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
They could be any
design you like.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:84%
They could be the same, or
they could be different.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:90%
You create them.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
ready, I would like

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.839 align:middle line:84%
for you to choose
a door to go in to.

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And we go there and
we open the door.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And now go and open the door.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And inhale and exhale.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you enter that
doorway, there are gray mists.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:90%
Clouds.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%
A gray mist.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:90%
And just go now in these vapors.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Just become aware that
you as a soul being

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:90%
are standing in these vapors.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:90%
And you're descending down.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.280 align:middle line:90%
You're descending down.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Feeling going lower and
lower to the ground.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And soon you go back to
another existence, a past life.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Now you're back
on the earth and I

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
want you to look
down at your feet

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.747 align:middle line:84%
and see what kind of shoes,
if any, you're wearing.

00:11:28.747 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:90%
The footwear, if any.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Become mindful of the terrain.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Is it water?

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.635 align:middle line:90%
Is it jungle?

00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Is it land?

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it Earth?

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And now you look around
you and see the atmosphere

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.145 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
that you're standing.

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it a city environment?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it a country environment?

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it an ancient environment?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.920 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel
like as far as time?

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.526 align:middle line:90%
Roughly what is the time?

00:11:57.526 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Look down at the type of
dress that you're wearing,

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the attire that you're
wearing, if any.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.646 align:middle line:84%
What kind of costume
we have on, if any.

00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
What does it look
like and what does it

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.395 align:middle line:90%
feel like in that lifetime?

00:12:07.395 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now you become very mindful of
people who come close to you

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
in that lifetime and become
aware of who they are.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
There might be
some people who you

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:90%
know in this current lifetime.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And just be mindful.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Who comes into your play?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Who comes into
that lifetime that

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
is significant to
you in that lifetime?

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.265 align:middle line:84%
Who is significant to
you in that lifetime?

00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:84%
What is your soul
learning in that lifetime?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
What is the number
one major lesson

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
your soul is learning
in that lifetime?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Your soul will tell you.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.379 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going back, back, higher,
higher, higher in the realms.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Back into the realms.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Back into the realm
before the two doors now.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
There are two doors
now before you.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And now your soul is going
to enter another time door.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:90%
So enter that time door.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Open it up.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.160 align:middle line:90%
See the vapors.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Inhale and exhale.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:90%
Now you're descending down.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Going down to the
earth or wherever

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go
in that lifetime.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.484 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to be the Earth,

00:13:27.484 --> 00:13:29.275 align:middle line:84%
it could be another
planet, another system.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
have to be the Earth.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And as you go down,
look down at your feet

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and see what kind of footwear,
if any, that you're wearing.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.003 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful of the terrain.

00:13:39.003 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Is it country?

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it a city environment?

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.315 align:middle line:90%
Is it dry?

00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Is it water?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Just be mindful.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And then look around the
atmosphere, the environment

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're in.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Is there a time perhaps?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:90%
A date which you can place.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not important, but
if it feels right to you,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.734 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And then become aware in that
lifetime of different people

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.450 align:middle line:84%
coming close to you
and the different roles

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
they play in that lifetime.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And be mindful of
how they affect

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:90%
your soul in that lifetime.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.068 align:middle line:84%
What lessons do you
need to learn from them

00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:90%
in that lifetime?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And now there's one
overall strong lesson

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
again in this lifetime,
and what is it?

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.356 align:middle line:84%
Let that come to the
forefront of your mind.

00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:35.944 align:middle line:90%
And we're going back.

00:14:35.944 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Going higher, higher, back.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Now we're back in
the spiritual realm.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We have one more
door to go through.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
See that door right
there in front of you.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's open up that door.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And step in.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:90%
There are the vapors.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath and exhale.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.780 align:middle line:90%
Descending down, down, down.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And now you find you're in
another lifetime, a very

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:90%
different lifetime.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Become aware of your feet.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
If there are shoes
or footwear, if any.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Become aware yet
again of the terrain.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:90%
Again, is it country?

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Is it city?

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Is it dry?

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Is it wet?

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, be
mindful yet again

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of the environment, the
atmosphere you're in.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Is it a city?

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Is it the jungle?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Is it dry?

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.825 align:middle line:84%
What time period if you can
get a time period, that's fine.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And yet again, become
mindful of the people

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:90%
now who appear in that lifetime.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
They come to you and see
the different characters,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the different
roles they take on.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:84%
What is their purpose for being
in your life at that time?

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.606 align:middle line:84%
Is there a thread
that connects you

00:15:53.606 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:84%
from each lifetime
with that person,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:90%
that soul, the other soul?

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:90%
The various situations.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.265 align:middle line:84%
And then take a deep
breath and exhale.

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Take one more deep breath
and come back into the body.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.354 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:16:14.354 --> 00:16:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Coming back into the
body in this chair.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
The current time,
the current lifetime.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Just one more very deep breath
and bring you totally back.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.229 align:middle line:90%
And inhale and exhale.

00:16:25.229 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Feeling your feet on the floor.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Your legs and the
chair on your back.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Your shoulders and your arms.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Your chest, your stomach,
your neck and your head.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.297 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Did you enjoy that?

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Powerful, yes?

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.244 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:46.244 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Really powerful.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.326 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you, you
were great to work with you.

00:16:49.326 --> 00:16:51.140 align:middle line:84%
You were great to
work with because I,

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:84%
being a sensitive and an
empath, I feel your energies.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I feel when you're
there, when you go with me

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're on the
journey with me

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:90%
and you get out of your stuff.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.594 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, isn't it great
when you get out of your stuff?

00:17:02.594 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:90%
And just be.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:90%
And just be.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And you could do this
on your own, as well.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have CDs, of course, that
have this type of meditations.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:90%
This regression.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.659 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just interested to
hear about from you guys

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:90%
some of your experiences.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Like what was a major overall
theme, lessons your soul

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.985 align:middle line:84%
had to learn from
lifetime to lifetime.

00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:22.818 align:middle line:90%
I'd just be curious.

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:90%
So can we do that?

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Who would like to share?

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Hi, sweetheart.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's Terry.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Terry.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about your experience.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I couldn't
get out of this one past life

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What was it?

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.015 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was
a beautiful mountain

00:17:34.015 --> 00:17:37.201 align:middle line:84%
town with a sea or
water beneath it.

00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed like it was
maybe during the Roman times

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.290 align:middle line:90%
or something older.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I had sandals on,
it was late spring.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was
there, and I knew

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.726 align:middle line:84%
that I was there to
learn simplicity in life.

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was
she your mother

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
in that lifetime also or
was she a different person?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She seemed the same.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She seemed
like a mother figure?

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.769 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:52.769 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same one I have
today because apparently I

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
haven't learned that lesson
about simplicity in my life.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So I just got that
one thing that it

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.194 align:middle line:84%
was just quiet and peaceful
and beautiful mountain town.

00:18:02.194 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And then my mother
was there to teach me

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.610 align:middle line:84%
about living simply
as a good way to go.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.492 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And in
this current lifetime,

00:18:09.492 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is it all about
simplicity for you?

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to
learn those lessons

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.392 align:middle line:90%
about I need to be more simple?

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:15.391 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's more
about peace and simplicity

00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
for my mother, so I think she's
still trying to teach me that.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.000 align:middle line:84%
She still wants that
in her life this time.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you go back
and forth many times, too.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:90%
You learn from each other also.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else show up in the
lifetime besides your mom?

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I didn't
notice anybody else.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.079 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Over here, perhaps.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.986 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this lovely lady over here.

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Hi, sweetheart.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cynthia.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Cynthia.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
You want to share with
us about your experience.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'd love to.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
In all of the lifetimes there
was a theme about connection,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.815 align:middle line:90%
not being connected.

00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Not
being connected

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.395 align:middle line:90%
to people or to yourself?

00:18:47.395 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, in the
first life feeling a sense

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
of community
connected to the land.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:84%
It was a beautiful
island and there

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.990 align:middle line:90%
was a great sense of connection.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
life I was on a boat

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.247 align:middle line:84%
and just people all around me
feeling completely separate.

00:19:04.247 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Interesting.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.496 align:middle line:84%
And what about another
lifetime, like the third one?

00:19:07.496 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Another lifetime
I was different gender

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.997 align:middle line:84%
and I was really connected
more to the earth.

00:19:13.997 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Interesting.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.706 align:middle line:84%
And did anyone show
up in that lifetime

00:19:16.706 --> 00:19:18.163 align:middle line:84%
who's in your
current lifetime now?

00:19:18.163 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'd be
interested in hearing that.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.906 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:20.906 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I have two friends that
are very close to me,

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:90%
they're like family.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.972 align:middle line:90%
And they were on the island.

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.921 align:middle line:84%
And the characteristics that
they were in that lifetime

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:90%
were similar in this lifetime?

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:84%
The same characteristics
or different?

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.001 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I guess, yeah,
because they're like family.

00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:90%
They were family on the island.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
it's familiarity.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were helping your
soul in learning connectedness?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, and
they've been helping me

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime, too.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous
very, very good.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody have
because, you know,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation-- or I should
say past life regression

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.825 align:middle line:84%
many times, we also work
with fears and phobias.

00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
fears and phobias

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:84%
we have in this current lifetime
can have a direct correlation

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
to a past life.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, I was always
afraid of swimming-- water.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Always afraid of water.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't start swimming until
I was 20 years old, I think.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I freaked when I
went into the water.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Heights.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't like heights.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Anybody here don't like heights?

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.270 align:middle line:90%
And water stuff?

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So I found out from a
past life regression

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that I did that I was a
galley slave in a lifetime.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And I saw it so clearly.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was chained up to the
middle, this middle part

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:90%
of the galley, the ship.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And all of us, all these galley
slaves were rowing, rowing

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and there was some kind of
a tidal wave or wave that

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
came in, and we all died
and we could not escape.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that had a
direct correlation

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to my fear of
swimming and water.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And once I did that
past life regression,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and I witnessed that, I was
never afraid of water again.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So really this work,
past life regression,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
you can go back to
these past lives

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and you can see where your fears
are, where your phobias lie.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the soul--
many times the soul

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:84%
will carry that memory into
the soul fabric and relive it

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it
feels very, very real.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a memory
from the past life.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, eh?

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It's so interesting.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So you could do a lot of work
with that with therapy work

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:90%
So it really does help.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else want to share
an experience they had.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
And what is your first name?

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Michael?

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Michael.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Michael.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.819 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I am aware
of quite a few past lives

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
so it was tough for the first
door for me to single one out

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
or allow one to come
through and stay.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was a recurring
one and it was definitely

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Native American.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.227 align:middle line:90%
And in this area--

00:21:42.227 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In the
area of Colorado?

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.476 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:44.476 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Right in the greater
Boulder valley here.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I've been here before.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But the new part to this one is
that this young man right here

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:84%
in the front row on the
end, who I just met today

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle line:84%
for the first time,
was there with me.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.732 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:22:02.732 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:84%
You met Michael for
the first time today?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I don't
know if you felt a connection

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.324 align:middle line:84%
or that you'd known
each other or something.

00:22:08.324 --> 00:22:09.823 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
it was interesting

00:22:09.823 --> 00:22:11.340 align:middle line:84%
because we found
that we instantly

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
had a lot to talk about, a lot
of little things in common,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:84%
a lot of activities
and interests.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So we bonded like that
out in the hallway

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.110 align:middle line:90%
just a little while ago.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's wild.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And your past life experience.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm just curious.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I know before
we talked about some

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:90%
if that influenced it or what.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:90%
What did you have?

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.408 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There
were three doors.

00:22:29.408 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:90%
One was a square, simple door.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And I went through that and I
was on like the Corsican coast.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Sandals, I could smell the dust.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
There was a cool
breeze off the water.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Hot sun.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:42.234 align:middle line:84%
I think my brother may
have been there with me,

00:22:42.234 --> 00:22:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
he was my brother,

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.563 align:middle line:84%
but he was still a
pain in the rear end.

00:22:45.563 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.024 align:middle line:90%
So he could very well have been.

00:22:48.024 --> 00:22:49.565 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't
that interesting.

00:22:49.565 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And the other two,
the second one I went through

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
was funny because it put me
right on the deck of a ship

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:90%
wearing boots.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
was all about there,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get a strong sense
of what I was there to learn.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.675 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You don't
know what your lesson was?

00:23:01.675 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Your overall strong
lesson on that one.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.988 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had a hard
time pulling that out.

00:23:04.988 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The first time seemed
to be something

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:84%
to do with the community
and working with others.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is the middle door

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.379 align:middle line:90%
was like a Japanese door.

00:23:14.379 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
through there it felt

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.530 align:middle line:90%
like I was in feudal Japan.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything was highly
structured, highly disciplined,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and I struggled with
discipline, which I tremendously

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.274 align:middle line:90%
do to this day.

00:23:26.274 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
that's a running theme?

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think so.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that a
running theme in your life?

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Discipline?

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Dealing with discipline--

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.923 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think it is.

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --authority
figures maybe?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.218 align:middle line:90%
Are you married?

00:23:35.218 --> 00:23:35.926 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Bing.

00:23:35.926 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Nailed it.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
so you're married.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:90%
So you get this.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.184 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Throw me
under the bus here.

00:23:42.184 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
really interesting.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.933 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:23:44.933 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I said before that I
felt like a teacher with you.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But I also could
see shaman with you.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.614 align:middle line:90%
A lifetime of shaman.

00:23:52.614 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And I would not
be a bit surprised

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:84%
in this current lifetime if
your soul has an attraction

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
to shamanic works, natural
healing, stones, crystals,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:90%
color, healing.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you'd
be attracted to that.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
Does that sense to you?

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.416 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
it's in your soul.

00:24:08.416 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So all of our past
lives are in the soul.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Its becomes a soul fabric.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I love that biblical
story about Joseph

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and the coat of many colors.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, symbolically
what that means,

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
is really the coat of many
colors of many lifetimes.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And that each lifetime makes
a certain color in the soul

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.142 align:middle line:90%
fabric and we become this.

00:24:33.142 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just-- because I'm
very drawn to you, which

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.437 align:middle line:84%
is really interesting because
there's an affinity there.

00:24:37.437 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I can just see that the
healing properties with you,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:84%
the shamanic, the teacher,
the getting the words out,

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:90%
expressing.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to say with you,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.865 align:middle line:84%
if I can be so bold,
to just say that-- see

00:24:47.865 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:90%
now I'm going to cry.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I'm
connecting here

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.085 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to
start crying and getting

00:24:52.085 --> 00:24:53.260 align:middle line:90%
emotional which is good.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Cry.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Crying is good.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:90%
It heals the soul

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've struggled
in lifetimes with authority,

00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.761 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that you've
come in this lifetime

00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:04.200 align:middle line:84%
as an authority figure in
a way, and that gives you

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more sensitivity
to others who are struggling.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Like kids, like I said
for being a teacher

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.154 align:middle line:84%
or being around
children, you give them

00:25:11.154 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more leeway.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.806 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's really hard
for you to be a disciplinarian.

00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that right?

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.418 align:middle line:90%
See, now you're crying.

00:25:19.418 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:90%
So I know we're connecting here.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:90%
Truth is there.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel it.

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You feel it.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's almost a
painful empathy and compassion,

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:84%
especially for the downtrodden,
the underdog, children, dogs,

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
we work with rescue
organizations.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
married and you

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:90%
work with rescue organizations?

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:37.455 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:37.455 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Dog rescue.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Dog rescue.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:41.605 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's the compassion.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.578 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:51.301 align:middle line:90%
[CLAPPING]

00:25:51.301 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much everyone
for that experience.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I hope that helped you.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I hope it helped
you at home, as well.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.942 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it's
really interesting

00:25:58.942 --> 00:26:01.525 align:middle line:84%
to get to know your soul and why
you have certain experiences.

00:26:01.525 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Why you're attracted
to certain people.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Why there's an affinity to
certain places of living,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.451 align:middle line:84%
to certain habits, certain
hobbies, certain skills

00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
which have worked on lifetime
after lifetime after lifetime.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find maybe in this
lifetime you're an artist.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a past life
or several past lives,

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.841 align:middle line:84%
you could have been an
artist or working your way

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to this current lifetime
to perfect that skill.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.265 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
what it's about.

00:26:20.265 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to tune in
right now to this gentleman

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.750 align:middle line:90%
standing right-- standing.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.362 align:middle line:84%
The standing man standing
right behind you.

00:26:26.362 --> 00:26:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you
a message from your father.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Father passed over, correct?

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:90%
May I work with you?

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:90%
So would you mind standing up?

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Brendon.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.206 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Brendon.

00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I have a man here who's
a father figure to you.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And he's right behind you.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's a man which I'm
going to describe him

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:90%
to you if that's OK.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lady that's
come in to the side over here.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.746 align:middle line:90%
And he's connected with her.

00:26:44.746 --> 00:26:46.964 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if it's
a mother of his-- there's

00:26:46.964 --> 00:26:48.880 align:middle line:84%
a female connection
here-- or a sister of his.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.601 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure yet.

00:26:49.601 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's work.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK if I work with you?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.703 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell you
that as this man comes in,

00:26:54.703 --> 00:26:56.027 align:middle line:90%
he's very structured.

00:26:56.027 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%
He's very structured in his way.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.401 align:middle line:90%
He stands here like this.

00:26:58.401 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:90%
He's very structured.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.532 align:middle line:90%
He knows what he wants.

00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:90%
He knows what he wants to do.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:90%
It's black and white with him.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel a
lot of spontaneity

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:90%
necessarily with this gentlemen.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he likes to know
things before they happen.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's hard sometimes with him.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.244 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I understand
before he passes over,

00:27:14.244 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
there must have been trouble
with walking or trouble

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.054 align:middle line:90%
with his legs.

00:27:17.054 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.386 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I got to tell you,

00:27:19.386 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
the condition that I have
here is that I can't walk.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.729 align:middle line:90%
I can't get up and get around.

00:27:23.729 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very much so.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is this your--
are you also connected with him?

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Is this your father as well?

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Your father-in-law?

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Father-in-law.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Father-in-law.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.275 align:middle line:90%
My father.

00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
mind standing as well?

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Would that be OK?

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.675 align:middle line:90%
I think you're great.

00:27:33.675 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:90%
The two of you are great.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:36.035 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:27:36.035 --> 00:27:36.910 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cynthia.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cynthia.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:90%
And you're husband and wife.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you knew
his father, didn't you?

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.846 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know that this man as he

00:27:41.846 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%
comes close over here,
he wants to thank you.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.951 align:middle line:84%
He gives you a kiss
on your forehead.

00:27:44.951 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to thank you
for taking care of him.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
there was some kind of a bed.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Not sure if it was a hospital
bed or some kind of a bed.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like you're
taking care of him

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.861 align:middle line:84%
at one point of you're
helping to take care of him.

00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And is your mom still
living on the earth?

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Your mom.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
passed over, too.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:90%
My mom has passed.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
she's on this side.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the lady that
I referred to earlier.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to go-- Now,
as your dad came in earlier,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that
they were talk about keys

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.870 align:middle line:90%
that he had.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:11.370 align:middle line:90%
Keys.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't if they were
car keys or house keys.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you
have them-- hold on.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Got you.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Got you.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.644 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to have some
keys remade when he was sick?

00:28:20.644 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you remember that?

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:90%
He said there were three keys.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And the
three keys were remade.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.751 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:28:28.751 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
everything is very organized

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with your father and he
likes things organized.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.920 align:middle line:84%
He's likes his papers
in a certain way.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
He likes all his possessions
in a certain way.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:90%
So we know this.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I also gotta tell you the mother
comes in very, very close.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And I got a lady around you.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:44.895 align:middle line:84%
Is your mother also
passed over, please?

00:28:44.895 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.455 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I have
a lady on this side of you--

00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:47.270 align:middle line:90%
a mother figure.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
First let me talk with her
and then we'll go and see her.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.697 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that this
lady, your mother

00:28:51.697 --> 00:28:53.280 align:middle line:84%
must've been there
before your father.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:54.516 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:54.516 --> 00:28:56.291 align:middle line:90%
She transitioned quite a bit.

00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Before him, yes?

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I get her talking to me

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and she's laughing, she's
laughing, she's laughing.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, she's the one

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
who brings the spontaneity
in the relationship.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very much so.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:07.921 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:08.711 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:29:08.711 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:84%
He's much more direct
and she's more [YELLS].

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.290 align:middle line:90%
And she's fun.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:90%
She's loving.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Now would she ever love the
coupons when she was younger?

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.244 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
you remember the memory

00:29:18.244 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
she gives me is cutting
up those coupons

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and having the
coupons in a drawer.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And they
were never organized.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.659 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:25.324 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:25.324 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:27.608 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she also shows me

00:29:27.608 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:10%
that she had index
cards at one time.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.961 align:middle line:10%
Those 3 x 5 white index cards
for recipes or something

00:29:32.961 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:10%
in a box.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:33.780 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:10%
And the box is a yellow box.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.327 align:middle line:10%
A plastic yellow box.

00:29:37.327 --> 00:29:38.160 align:middle line:10%
You understand that.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:10%
That's what she shows
me in my mind's eye.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.018 align:middle line:10%
I'm very, very
aware that she likes

00:29:41.018 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:10%
to keep her soup recipes,
her other recipes in there.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:10%
There's one about noodles,
there's a casserole one.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand this?

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know Wednesdays
we'd like casseroles.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:84%
She used to make
casseroles on Wednesdays.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.117 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:53.117 --> 00:29:54.908 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does that
makes sense to you?

00:29:54.908 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, completely.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.894 align:middle line:84%
I come from a family of five and
she had to make the best of--

00:29:59.894 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
because she said

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Wednesdays were casserole days.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is what
she was talking about.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh, and they
used to love the ground beef.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:84%
I used to put the ground
beef in there and make it.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.309 align:middle line:84%
She's going through
her whole recipe here.

00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:10.554 align:middle line:90%
It was like, wow.

00:30:10.554 --> 00:30:11.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:90%
And she has apron on.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.582 align:middle line:84%
She has an apron
here but she also

00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:15.790 align:middle line:90%
puts the apron over the head.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:90%
This one.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Your mother doesn't like the
city, she's in the country.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I want to take care of things.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:90%
She really wants to clean up.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.390 align:middle line:84%
She really is a
lady who comes in

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:84%
as a mother figure as far
as-- you said five kids.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.630 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the way she
is in that lifetime taking

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.612 align:middle line:90%
care of everyone.

00:30:28.612 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what she is.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:30.802 align:middle line:90%
She takes care of everyone.

00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when you were
a young boy with your father,

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.360 align:middle line:84%
do you remember anything
about doing something

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.990 align:middle line:90%
with storm windows or screens.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also want to
talk about who has the jams.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Did your mother have nice
jams or make stuff with fruit,

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.100 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother did.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
grandmother did.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.549 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember
going there on a Sunday,

00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:49.090 align:middle line:84%
on a Sunday or the
weekend, or having

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.506 align:middle line:84%
a connection with
your grandmother

00:30:50.506 --> 00:30:52.270 align:middle line:84%
making these beautiful
pies from fruit.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Fruit pies.

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Not so much the fruit pies
but rather ginger cookies that

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.229 align:middle line:90%
had a fruit center.

00:31:00.229 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fine.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.815 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I want to, young lady, come
with you here if I can.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:90%
And, honey, what is your name?

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cynthia.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cynthia.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.006 align:middle line:84%
So the information I'm
telling to your husband here,

00:31:11.006 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:84%
your partner, that
you understand

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:90%
many of these things?

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I want to
talk about your mom, too.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.478 align:middle line:90%
Your mom is very, very proud.

00:31:17.478 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Very different energy than
your mother and your father.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.907 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about a sister for you.

00:31:22.907 --> 00:31:24.365 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking
about your sister.

00:31:24.365 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is your sister
on the other side of life?

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.921 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I have
to come with your sister.

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I've got to come in
here with your sister.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:90%
And she said, she's just fine.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:33.960 align:middle line:90%
She's just fine.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.710 align:middle line:90%
And she said she didn't suffer.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:36.460 align:middle line:90%
She didn't suffer.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Because there was a whole
thing about you were suffering.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.224 align:middle line:90%
Did she suffer?

00:31:40.224 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was
she in a lot of pain?

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.591 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she wasn't in pain.

00:31:43.591 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Your sister, when she
comes close to me,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm sick
from the inside out.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.161 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm very
sick on the inside out.

00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.326 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:52.326 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I feel like
I just can't get healthy.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell you
that-- I got to tell you

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel when I'm
younger, I don't have

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.524 align:middle line:90%
a good self image about myself.

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.825 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:32:03.825 --> 00:32:04.491 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:04.491 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
feel as if because of this

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:10%
not having a good self image
and not being aware of who she

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:10%
really is-- and, of
course, in this lifetime,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.792 align:middle line:10%
she probably had to learn
lessons about loving herself.

00:32:14.792 --> 00:32:15.750 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.470 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And value.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:10%
She says valuable.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:10%
Finding myself valuable.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:10%
And she said I didn't find
myself valuable enough.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.930 align:middle line:10%
I didn't find myself
valuable enough.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.135 align:middle line:10%
Now, were there two kids.

00:32:25.135 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:10%
Does she have two kids?

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.542 align:middle line:10%
Who has two kids?

00:32:27.542 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Three kids.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.535 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two or three.

00:32:30.535 --> 00:32:31.260 align:middle line:10%
Got it.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:10%
So three kids still here?

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.210 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:33.918 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:36.172 align:middle line:10%
And I know there are two in one.

00:32:36.172 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what that means.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:10%
Two boys and on girl,
two girls and one boy.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:39.735 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:39.735 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.624 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Why is
there two and one.

00:32:41.624 --> 00:32:43.462 align:middle line:84%
Is there two that
are together and that

00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:84%
speak with each other
and then one that's

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of separate on their own?

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Two live in closer
proximity and the other one

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.822 align:middle line:90%
lives in a different area.

00:32:51.822 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.196 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's it.

00:32:53.196 --> 00:32:53.760 align:middle line:90%
Not sure.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But she's talking about
two and one to me.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Would you give them
my love, please?

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.156 align:middle line:90%
Give them all my love.

00:32:58.156 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Can I let you know that
she has perfume on?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.190 align:middle line:10%
She's wearing perfume.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:10%
She's wearing nice clothes.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.594 align:middle line:10%
And she finally said, I'm
able to wear nice clothes

00:33:04.594 --> 00:33:06.070 align:middle line:10%
because I feel I'm worth it now.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: That's beautiful.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, your mom
is taking good care of her.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:10%
Your mom is very-- your
mom is down to earth, too.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:13.670 align:middle line:10%
She's very stable.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.442 align:middle line:10%
She's really a kind
lady, your mom.

00:33:16.442 --> 00:33:17.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to say
a very kind woman.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting
because before we

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.330 align:middle line:10%
were talking about animals and
people taking care of animals,

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.690 align:middle line:10%
and your mother's doing that.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.130 align:middle line:10%
She's telling me about she's
taking care of the animals.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.500 align:middle line:10%
I hope that makes sense to you.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.616 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does it?

00:33:27.616 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Did she take care
of animals here?

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She was just a very
hugely compassionate woman.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.540 align:middle line:90%
She was a reader.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.665 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who grew up
on a farm or near a farm?

00:33:35.665 --> 00:33:38.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.132 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm thinking my
friend Margaret who's not here.

00:33:43.132 --> 00:33:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Margaret
grew up on a farm.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.826 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:45.826 --> 00:33:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm not sure.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.554 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure about that.

00:33:48.554 --> 00:33:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Didn't your
mom grow up on a farm?

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:52.665 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my mom grew
up on a farm until she was--

00:33:52.665 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
mom grew up on a farm.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello!

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.390 align:middle line:90%
Hello!

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:59.410 align:middle line:84%
It was so long
before I was here.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.951 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's why your
mom was talking about the farm.

00:34:01.951 --> 00:34:03.424 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:34:03.424 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.374 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Got it?

00:34:06.374 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.067 align:middle line:84%
Many times-- and this is very
interesting to note this,

00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
the way communication
works-- is they come through

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.300 align:middle line:90%
with memories.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.699 align:middle line:84%
And these memories
to them, there

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is no linear time of
past and present, future.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.710 align:middle line:90%
It's all kind of one experience.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.659 align:middle line:84%
So they'll go back to the
memories that were created here

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.659 align:middle line:90%
in the physical Earth.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
And they come through
with those memories

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of create a
picture of that and that's

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.459 align:middle line:90%
what they give to me.

00:34:28.459 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And I just get out
whatever I get.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And many times I find the
spirit's good at giving it,

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty good at receiving
it, but the living person

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.850 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes not
good at receiving it.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Or they just can't
remember and it's common.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.900 align:middle line:90%
It's common.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.329 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:53.662 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:53.662 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:55.203 align:middle line:90%
You have a question.

00:34:55.203 --> 00:34:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mary.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.751 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mary.

00:34:57.751 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Mary.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.331 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:01.477 align:middle line:84%
You talked about how we
tend to travel in groups.

00:35:01.477 --> 00:35:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Group souls.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just curious about that.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of 10 children.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
one of 10 children.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So I grew
up in a big environment

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.604 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of extended
family, as well.

00:35:11.604 --> 00:35:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let's
stop right there.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you grew up with a
family with 10 children,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
odds are that you came
back with all those souls

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:90%
from other past lives.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.360 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're working out
certain karmic obligations,

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.555 align:middle line:84%
certain lessons for
each of your souls.

00:35:27.555 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And not every
lifetime will there

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
be 10 souls that will come back.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:30.820 align:middle line:90%
There could be two.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.653 align:middle line:90%
There could be four.

00:35:31.653 --> 00:35:32.445 align:middle line:90%
There could be six.

00:35:32.445 --> 00:35:33.902 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
lessons that need

00:35:33.902 --> 00:35:35.410 align:middle line:84%
to be accomplished
in this lifetime.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can have
it now with 10 people.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to accomplish those
lessons for the soul group.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So in this lifetime, you
could have all come back

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and be 10 members
of this family.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of you needed
certain experiences,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.580 align:middle line:84%
situations that
would present itself

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.845 align:middle line:84%
if you came back in a
family unit in that way.

00:35:52.845 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.480 align:middle line:90%
You have a question over here?

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.290 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Kim.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Kim.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.241 align:middle line:90%
So I have a twin sister.

00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And--

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let me just
interrupt you with that

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.456 align:middle line:90%
because it's fabulous.

00:36:08.456 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:90%
A twin.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So what does a twin mean
as far as reincarnation?

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And twins, twin
souls, and so forth.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.885 align:middle line:84%
It seems that you
souls-- what are twins

00:36:16.885 --> 00:36:19.500 align:middle line:84%
are basically two
souls that have shared

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.234 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many, many lifetimes
together very, very close.

00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
right and the left.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.899 align:middle line:90%
The black and the white.

00:36:25.899 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:90%
The Yin and the Yang.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.745 align:middle line:84%
So things that
will happen to her

00:36:28.745 --> 00:36:29.660 align:middle line:84%
will sometimes happen
to you and vice versa.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:30.795 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All the time.

00:36:30.795 --> 00:36:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All the time.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And we hear about
this with twins.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like you're
sharing one life together.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you decided
to come back to school

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and go through many
classes together.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.370 align:middle line:84%
There's an affinity that
you have for each other.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
what a twin is.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.730 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly true.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So I had done a past
life regression-- well,

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
we did hypnotherapy and I
went back to being in the womb

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.691 align:middle line:84%
with her and then
before we incarnated.

00:36:52.691 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And what I
got was that she came in

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to my mom's body and then
I was like, wait, wait,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming with you.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:90%
So then I zoomed in.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Definitely.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But she's very
connected to our family.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I am too, but not
as much as her.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't live with them.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I choose to live here.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So even
though you're twins

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and there are a lot of the same
lessons you're going to learn,

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.836 align:middle line:84%
also you're going to
learn individual lessons.

00:37:17.836 --> 00:37:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So obviously she
has other lessons

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:84%
with those family
members that she

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
has to evolve with
and grow through

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.100 align:middle line:84%
with and learn from
and go through.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.672 align:middle line:84%
And so that's fine because
you're individual souls.

00:37:28.672 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You realize that?

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.831 align:middle line:84%
So you'll have
individual lessons.

00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But, indeed, she's learning
her own lessons with that.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:33.212 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:33.212 --> 00:37:35.212 align:middle line:84%
Because she seems much
more connected and closer

00:37:35.212 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:90%
to the immediate family.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In this lifetime.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In this lifetime.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
maybe another lifetime

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.490 align:middle line:90%
you'll have that experience.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.750 align:middle line:90%
It's all about experiences.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.517 align:middle line:90%
I love twins.

00:37:43.517 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I love the whole
connection with that.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.150 align:middle line:90%
It's such a--

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We're like one.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.194 align:middle line:90%
Like one mind.

00:37:48.194 --> 00:37:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly right.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:49.951 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:49.951 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:50.910 align:middle line:90%
I

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.921 align:middle line:84%
There's a lady here that
comes from the spirit world.

00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mother
figure that comes to me.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm drawn
to this side of the room

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.285 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to bring
the lady through with more

00:38:01.285 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:84%
of a description of
this lady because I

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:84%
feel like I'm in my
70s when I pass over.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I feel like my death was fine.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I either
fall asleep and I pass.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:90%
My heart stops.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel that it
was a traumatic death.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel it was
something like I

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:14.840 align:middle line:90%
was sick for a long time.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I just
quick-- silently just go.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.149 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just gonna do that.

00:38:19.149 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like they find me
in the bed in the morning.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.305 align:middle line:84%
And there's a connection
with the husband.

00:38:23.305 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if the husband
passed to the spirit world

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.919 align:middle line:84%
first, but I definitely
feel that there's

00:38:27.919 --> 00:38:29.710 align:middle line:84%
a connection that's
strong with my husband.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.544 align:middle line:84%
If he didn't pass before,
he could have passed right

00:38:32.544 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:84%
after because there's
such a connection.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I also feel as if there's a
religious element to this lady.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So she was either Catholic
or a very religious lady.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And I do get-- go on.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to go toward, I
know I'm in the Midwest.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.345 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm
going over here.

00:38:47.345 --> 00:38:48.242 align:middle line:90%
Did your mom pass?

00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mother-in-law.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:50.616 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mother-in-law.

00:38:50.616 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind standing up and
we can work with you maybe?

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lisa.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Lisa.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So, Lisa, you understand about
this lady who goes to sleep

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's how she
passes, in her sleep.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like I'm in my 70s.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.901 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that make sense to you?

00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And would it be early
70s, like 72, 73?

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.538 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:05.538 --> 00:39:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to remember.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:07.598 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:07.598 --> 00:39:08.860 align:middle line:90%
So I feel like I'm 72, 73.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there's a connection

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:90%
with a husband very close.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.345 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:39:12.345 --> 00:39:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And was he already
on the other side of life?

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
would it have been

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:84%
within like a two-year period
that he'd been over there first

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:90%
before her?

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:20.692 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:21.620 align:middle line:90%
A few more years than that.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A few more years.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I'm
feeling around a two.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.731 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I could be wrong.

00:39:25.731 --> 00:39:28.911 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she kept his
watch after he passed away.

00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Because she's telling
me I kept his watch.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.107 align:middle line:84%
And either she wore
the watch sometimes,

00:39:33.107 --> 00:39:35.565 align:middle line:84%
she had his watch around, or
she looked at it all the time.

00:39:35.565 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That could be.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:36.805 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:36.805 --> 00:39:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about-- Is
your father also passed over,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your actual--
your father, please?

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And are the
other girls here with you?

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.855 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are
the sisters here?

00:39:44.855 --> 00:39:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Where are they?

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We're all sisters.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're all sisters?

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.370 align:middle line:90%
All four of you, right?

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.726 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And your
dad's coming in strong.

00:39:50.726 --> 00:39:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So he wants to
say, hi, I'm here.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And his personality--
I love his personality,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:84%
which I'll bring to
right after this lady.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.011 align:middle line:84%
I just got to give her
the floor right now.

00:39:58.011 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving you
roses from this lady.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Very much so roses.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you for that.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.090 align:middle line:84%
She said to me,
they weren't sure

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:06.440 align:middle line:84%
if they were going to
put me in the casket

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.720 align:middle line:84%
or what they were going
to do with my body--

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
whether they were going burn
me or put me in a casket.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
that conversation?

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.288 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:11.288 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And did you have it with
your husband and brothers?

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: His sisters.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't there
conversation about what

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.568 align:middle line:90%
to do with the remains.

00:40:19.568 --> 00:40:20.410 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would you
know anyone named Joseph or Joe?

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
a brother, Joe.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Joe.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Who's still alive down here.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Because your dad is coming
and talking about Joe.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Joey.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.251 align:middle line:90%
He said Joey.

00:40:29.251 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:30.320 align:middle line:90%
Joey.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.553 align:middle line:90%
Joey.

00:40:31.553 --> 00:40:33.937 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:33.937 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kidney
problems, really?

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.344 align:middle line:90%
So someone with kidney problems.

00:40:37.344 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you
have kidney problems

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.380 align:middle line:90%
or someone has kidney problems.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.139 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother Jerry.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Our other
brother has them right now.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your brother Jerry
has kidney problems right now.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:46.819 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So let the lady bring
your father through.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.030 align:middle line:90%
But I want to give you roses.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to say thank you for
your help with her arrangements

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and give my love to my
boy-- my boy, her son.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he
works very hard.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:90%
He works too hard.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.944 align:middle line:84%
And his hours just
changed in his job.

00:41:00.944 --> 00:41:01.902 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:41:01.902 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.528 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he says
he's got to calm that down.

00:41:05.528 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:84%
He's got to make it
even and balanced

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:84%
because he's working
himself-- and she goes,

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.720 align:middle line:84%
he's going to work
himself into a grave.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't that funny
coming from her.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's exactly it.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
her personality.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.667 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it is.

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.125 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I got to tell you

00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that she is really
an interesting lady.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:90%
I will bring him through.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.240 align:middle line:90%
She likes to talk.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.371 align:middle line:84%
She says this is my time
I can express myself.

00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I can speak.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:28.690 align:middle line:90%
I got to speak.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was blessed
to pass the way I went.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.150 align:middle line:90%
She was very blessed.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- how
interesting-- she said,

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.930 align:middle line:90%
you know, we earn the way we go.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.299 align:middle line:84%
Our souls earn the
way we pass over.

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So isn't
that interesting?

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.851 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'd
heard that before, as well.

00:41:47.851 --> 00:41:50.951 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you do good
work, you do the best you can,

00:41:50.951 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and maybe that's your
destiny of your soul

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.650 align:middle line:90%
to pass the way you pass.

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:54.691 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that's true.

00:41:54.691 --> 00:41:55.540 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask all
four of you to stand,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.798 align:middle line:84%
which is a first time on this
show with one microphone.

00:42:00.798 --> 00:42:04.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.007 align:middle line:84%
I want to go really to
this lady at the end.

00:42:06.007 --> 00:42:07.090 align:middle line:90%
You're all sisters, right?

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Because your dad wants
to come in very strongly.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.785 align:middle line:90%
And he's with a grandmother.

00:42:10.785 --> 00:42:12.250 align:middle line:90%
He's with a mother over here.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.420 align:middle line:84%
He also has a sister
over here-- his sister.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.912 align:middle line:90%
And I gotta tell you about that.

00:42:15.912 --> 00:42:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about--
who was the Irish?

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Some Irish in the background
somewhere, please.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.332 align:middle line:90%
And Polish or something.

00:42:21.332 --> 00:42:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have an
aunt that's Polish.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: An
aunt that's Polish.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.071 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And would you know Tommy or Tom?

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:27.900 align:middle line:90%
That name?

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, we have a
cousin Tommy who is deceased.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to give love
from a Thomas or Tommy.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.026 align:middle line:90%
And he's with your dad.

00:42:33.026 --> 00:42:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's someone
named Robert.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Someone know who that is?

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, we
had grandfather Robert.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Grandfather Robert.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much, here as well.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I want
to go to the lake.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to be around a lake.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And your dad's
showing me the lake.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Your dad is giving me a
memory of going to the lake.

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And does that
makes sense to you?

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We went to the lake a
lot when we were kids.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.810 align:middle line:84%
A lake in Wisconsin
and we'd rent cottages

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.180 align:middle line:84%
with our aunts and
uncles, cousins.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.103 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So a
summertime lake and it

00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:52.780 align:middle line:90%
was a summertime experience.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And the memory he
gives me is this lake.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And the family being
around the lake

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.079 align:middle line:84%
and having a barbecue
and a good time

00:42:58.079 --> 00:42:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and the corn dogs and
that sort of a thing.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:00.215 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:00.215 --> 00:43:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And many cousins running around.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.476 align:middle line:84%
And bicycles he
shows me, as well.

00:43:03.476 --> 00:43:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Bicycles
he shows me, as well.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.479 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:05.479 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pass the
microphone on to this,

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:09.080 align:middle line:90%
well this lady right here.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:09.830 align:middle line:90%
You're the sister.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:10.942 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:43:10.942 --> 00:43:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lynn.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:12.441 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lynn.

00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:13.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.310 align:middle line:90%
And your mom is still alive?

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Is she still alive, please?

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that your father
wants to give love to her.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.772 align:middle line:84%
And I know that her eyes, I
know there's a glasses recently.

00:43:21.772 --> 00:43:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Her eyes were being affected.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.962 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:43:23.962 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:25.461 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:43:25.461 --> 00:43:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And just say yes if you get it!

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And no if you don't.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So I know that there's
either cataracts something

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.270 align:middle line:84%
with your mother because your
father's telling me that.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.718 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She just
finished cataract surgery.

00:43:36.718 --> 00:43:37.902 align:middle line:90%
Both eyes.

00:43:37.902 --> 00:43:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So you know that he is around
and that the spirit people

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.574 align:middle line:84%
are around helping
that situation.

00:43:43.574 --> 00:43:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And we all should know that.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.448 align:middle line:84%
That the spirit world
is always around us

00:43:46.448 --> 00:43:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to help us to infuse
healing and love.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Your father is a very funny man.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.660 align:middle line:90%
He has a real personality.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's, ah, she doesn't
want to see certain things.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.384 align:middle line:84%
He liked to read the
funnies, he said.

00:44:00.384 --> 00:44:01.800 align:middle line:84%
He liked to read
the funny papers.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's using the
term funny papers.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.371 align:middle line:90%
Liked to read the funny papers.

00:44:04.371 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's laughing a lot.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why but he tells
me has a full head of hair.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.600 align:middle line:90%
He has a full head of hair.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Now he has a full head of hair.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, your mother
has a wedding photo

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.364 align:middle line:84%
on the top of the
dresser in the bedroom.

00:44:17.364 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a photo,
black and white--

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just right on her
TV stand right where she lives.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Right
in front of her.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's
black and white, isn't it?

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Black and white.

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.546 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Vail.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.620 align:middle line:90%

And I know that

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:90%

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that is

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.316 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:44:36.316 --> 00:44:37.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what they just said.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Their caretaker just told

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.764 align:middle line:84%

00:44:42.764 --> 00:44:43.472 align:middle line:90%

00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:90%
He was very handsome.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He is.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.080 align:middle line:90%
He is very handsome.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it interesting
when people pass over

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:54.530 align:middle line:84%
in the world of spirit, they're
more real and more alive

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:90%
than we give them credit for.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.444 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they seem to be
a figment of our imagination.

00:44:59.444 --> 00:45:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And they're not.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very real.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that I
get your dad wanting to sit down

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.210 align:middle line:84%
in the chair and
putting his feet up.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you that I don't

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.640 align:middle line:84%
know why, but I'm with mom
and I'm watching television

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.660 align:middle line:90%
or I'm in a room there with her.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So where your mom
currently is right now,

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is there another chair close
by her couch right there?

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's in an
assisted living center.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.899 align:middle line:84%
So she sits on a chair
and watches television

00:45:24.899 --> 00:45:25.440 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Is there another
chair in that room?

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.496 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:28.496 --> 00:45:29.517 align:middle line:90%
We just scoot it close.

00:45:29.517 --> 00:45:31.975 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great, because
he sits in that chair with her

00:45:31.975 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:90%
when she watches television.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:33.415 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:33.415 --> 00:45:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
please let her know that.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you just move the photos
that you put in her room?

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:84%
You just put some new photos
in the room, didn't you?

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.624 align:middle line:84%
You just put some family photos
into her room, didn't you?

00:45:44.624 --> 00:45:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.785 align:middle line:84%
I printed them out and got
them all arranged for her.

00:45:47.785 --> 00:45:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just
recently didn't you?

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just within
the last few years.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.015 align:middle line:90%
She just moved in.

00:45:53.015 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Or another one.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.700 align:middle line:90%
We've added a couple.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:90%
That's right, we have.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You must
have added some recently.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:56.970 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:57.740 align:middle line:90%
You added that one.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he said recently.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:45:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Two of them.

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.580 align:middle line:90%
We just added two more.

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:01.079 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:03.472 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, and you
went through her drawers.

00:46:03.472 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:90%
You went through her drawers.

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:90%
You're changing things.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You're opening the drawers
where she's in assisted living.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:84%

opening up those drawers.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This
must have been recent

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:11.560 align:middle line:90%
because he's showing me this.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do that.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You just
did that didn't you?

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You just reorganized those
drawers for your mom?

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:16.829 align:middle line:90%
A couple days ago.

00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Routinely.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm the organized one.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I can tell that.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And your father's like, oh.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:90%
But he's watching you do that.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:28.453 align:middle line:90%
He's watching you do that.

00:46:28.453 --> 00:46:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, she has
things in those drawers

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.960 align:middle line:90%
that she doesn't need.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.880 align:middle line:90%
And you found that.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.385 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there must
have been a little shopping

00:46:34.385 --> 00:46:36.802 align:middle line:84%
bag that you had and you took
some stuff out of the drawer

00:46:36.802 --> 00:46:38.759 align:middle line:84%
and you're putting it in
a bag to take it away.

00:46:38.759 --> 00:46:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Mom doesn't need that.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I do
that all the time.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I do that a couple times a week.

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.002 align:middle line:90%
I go declutter.

00:46:46.002 --> 00:46:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But what he shows
me sweetheart is

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:84%
he's showing me a brown paper
bag with the little handles

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.760 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:50.055 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:50.055 --> 00:46:52.263 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's kind
of the one he's showing me.

00:46:52.263 --> 00:46:54.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just pulled
one of those-- Yeah.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
She lives in a small space so
I just always declutter, bring

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.860 align:middle line:90%
things home, and rearrange.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But you
understand that brown paper bag

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.090 align:middle line:84%
that he's talking
about with the handles?

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's telling me.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.276 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's telling me.

00:47:03.276 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Now he's talking
to me about there

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:08.020 align:middle line:84%
must have been three or
four siblings of his?

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:09.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Was there three or four?

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He had
three siblings total.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.730 align:middle line:90%

>>AUDIENCE: But there
was four of them.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there was
four of them all together.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:16.630 align:middle line:90%
So he's with all of them.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:18.042 align:middle line:90%
He wants me to tell you that.

00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that
he's at the shore.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I know that he likes the lake.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I like
to go to the shore.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:23.350 align:middle line:90%

And it's Chicago.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:90%

And I know that
Christmas time was

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:90%
a big tradition in the family.

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And got us all the

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.660 align:middle line:90%

in the fingers and the blood

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.079 align:middle line:90%
being drawn.

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Something about the blood
being drawn before he passes.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.200 align:middle line:90%
And he hates it.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:25.680 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.700 align:middle line:90%

>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.081 align:middle line:90%

>>VAN PRAAGH: He was on chemo.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:33.375 align:middle line:84%
I know that he told here
about fresh vegetables.

00:48:33.375 --> 00:48:34.795 align:middle line:90%
I'm being shown a fresh diet.

00:48:34.795 --> 00:48:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know someone
of you four, I'm

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:38.717 align:middle line:90%
not sure which one-- was it you?

00:48:38.717 --> 00:48:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Who either went and got
new fresh vegetables

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.682 align:middle line:84%
and changing your diet,
putting more organic stuff

00:48:42.682 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in there and fruits
and vegetables.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:90%
When did you do that?

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Just last week or something?

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:47.578 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:47.578 --> 00:48:49.875 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to eat
healthier and lose weight.

00:48:49.875 --> 00:48:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Did you just recently
get, he's showing me

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a
blender or a mixer?

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:90%
A brand new one.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.414 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:48:55.414 --> 00:48:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
with that blender, that mixer,

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.166 align:middle line:84%
that I can definitely put the
vegetables, the fruits in there

00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:01.916 align:middle line:84%
and make smoothies and
that sort of thing.

00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:04.071 align:middle line:84%
And green stuff
and he's like, eh.

00:49:04.071 --> 00:49:05.514 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:05.514 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's him.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.071 align:middle line:90%
Ew.

00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's exactly it.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:12.162 align:middle line:84%
So I just got to tell you that
he watches over all of you

00:49:12.162 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and I know that there's
a cross with him.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So I know he was Catholic.

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But I have a cross around
my neck, a gold cross.

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:19.984 align:middle line:90%
And he must've been in a coffin.

00:49:19.984 --> 00:49:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.775 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He had to be.

00:49:21.775 --> 00:49:22.380 align:middle line:90%
He had to be.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I see flowers everywhere
but I see them--

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.995 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he had grey
suit on with a red tie?

00:49:27.995 --> 00:49:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was a grey suit.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was it a
red tie and a grey suit?

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It was like a
reddish, burgundy type of tie.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That
sounds familiar.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
I'm seeing here.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:37.047 align:middle line:90%
And I have a cross.

00:49:37.047 --> 00:49:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And I know that I'm in rosaries.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know the rosaries
are a big deal.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
got to tell you that.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And that Joseph person,
who was that again?

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:44.558 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:44.558 --> 00:49:48.842 align:middle line:84%
Because he puts
something in the coffin.

00:49:48.842 --> 00:49:49.489 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Joseph put
something in the coffin.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:54.422 align:middle line:90%
And I like the Cubs.

00:49:54.422 --> 00:49:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.962 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:49:55.962 --> 00:49:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But
there's something

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.080 align:middle line:84%
in that coffin or something
in that thing about the Cubs

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That could be.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I just want to
tell you, you kids do the best.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:04.530 align:middle line:90%
I love you kids.

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Go to go.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Love you kids.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720 align:middle line:90%
And he whistles to you.

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.379 align:middle line:90%
He whistles.

00:50:07.379 --> 00:50:08.420 align:middle line:90%
He had a certain whistle.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave it at that.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.684 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:50:10.684 --> 00:50:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You can applaud
the spirit world.

00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:15.076 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:50:15.076 --> 00:50:21.270 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to thank everyone
here today and at home also.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:27.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a reminder.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.195 align:middle line:84%
It's a reminder to your
soul that indeed we

00:50:29.195 --> 00:50:30.530 align:middle line:90%
are eternal beings.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.190 align:middle line:84%
We are souls having a human
experience, not the other way

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.900 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And we come back in many, many
lifetimes to perfect our souls.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And the number one way
that we can perfect--

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm crying
because it's so true

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling it-- the number
one way to perfect and get it

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.790 align:middle line:84%
an A on all your
lessons is love.

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:51.655 align:middle line:84%
Demonstrate and use
love as best as you can.

00:50:51.655 --> 00:50:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And I assure you, you'll go
right to the head of the class.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you all very
much for being here.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, everyone.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Love and light.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:18.770 align:middle line:90%
