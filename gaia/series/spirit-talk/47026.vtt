00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ANNOUNCER: And now, world
renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:90%
James van Praagh.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hey!

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.651 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.687 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:00:36.687 --> 00:00:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.929 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also
for tuning in,

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
where I take you one
step closer to heaven.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for joining us here
today in our studio audience.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And as we get together
and we do these shows,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
we never know what's
going to happen

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
because we open ourselves
up to the spirit world

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and we really work with them
as far as what-- they have

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:84%
an agenda that they want
to come through with today,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:90%
and we're all just a part of it.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.111 align:middle line:84%
So will you join me and
go on a journey with me?

00:00:59.111 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.609 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That would
help not only you down here,

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
but many times help
the spirit world, yes?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I have been doing this work now
for 30 years, 30 long years.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing because the
information that comes through

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and the element of
healing which takes place,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
it just goes beyond
time and space.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And you never know in your
life, every one of us,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.329 align:middle line:84%
how we're going to affect
another person, do we?

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether we say something,
the words that come out

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
of our mouth, the thoughts
that we have of someone,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
the energy that we give out,
we will affect other people.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So you, as you are
here, and you're there,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
you're not just put down on
Earth, and you're thrown there,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.893 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:90%
It's sporadic.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Every single person
has a reason for being.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You are a soul having
a human experience.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:84%
You're a soul having
a human experience.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you can just shift
your perspective and step back

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and realize, wow, I am a soul
having this human experience--

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:84%
which really, when you
look at the soul level,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:90%
there is no such thing as time.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So time is only relative to
this three-dimensional world.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So just put these
things out there.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And as this show
goes on and you look

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
at these different
episodes and so forth,

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
throw things at you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.945 align:middle line:84%
and ask you to open up your
mind and open up your heart,

00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and start thinking about things
a little bit differently.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So today we're going to try to
think about, or just realize,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are a soul having
this human experience,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and there is no
such thing as time.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Crazy, huh?

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But just stay with
me on that one.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So if we are souls--
and I do believe

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that before you come back
into this incarnation,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and I think there are
many incarnations.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this world
down here is our schoolroom.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I really believe it's
our schoolroom down here.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And we, as souls, plan, if
you will, before we come back

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
to this human
experience, we will

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
sit with our guides and our
teachers, and we will work out,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.120 align:middle line:84%
if you will, various
aspects, different scenarios,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
different souls who
are going to come back

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.690 align:middle line:84%
with us-- whether it's
family meetings, family

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
people, or relationships
that we have,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
different scenarios that
we have in our lives.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that we plan
our lives out to some degree.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I do believe in what we
call soul destiny, yes?

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there are
density points that we look at

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and we plan out as best as
we can before we come back.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe also that there
are those others in our soul

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
group, others who attract-- like
attracts like-- other beings

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that we've been through with
in many, many lifetimes.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.989 align:middle line:90%
And different experiences.

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned different
aspects of our souls.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe
that is very true.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that because
of many, many years

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this work,
being the channel, if you will,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.874 align:middle line:90%
for spirit.

00:03:39.874 --> 00:03:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They have told me these
things, that you know,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
you are so much greater
than you let yourself know.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:90%
You're so much greater.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
If you could see what I see,
you'd be amazed at the beauty

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that I've been--
when I do work with spirit

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and I communicate with spirit,
and we have an exchange,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And the information that comes
through to prove, in a way,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:90%
that there is no death.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.680 align:middle line:84%
That there is no
such thing as death.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:90%
You cannot kill energy.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Energy changes form.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.952 align:middle line:84%
And spirits often
come through and I

00:04:07.952 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:84%
can hear them and see
them and feel them.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's so interesting-- that
part is easy, to some degree.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The hard part is
that I can see you

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:84%
for all of your
beautiful makeup,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
your beautiful heritage,
who you are as a soul being,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
all the gifts that
you have, and yet you

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:90%
don't see it for yourself.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's the hard part.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the hard part.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.004 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
are no accidents.

00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
I know as you come here
today in the audience,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and you that are
watching this, right now

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
at this particular
time, I believe

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:90%
that things are meant to be.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in coincidence.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.782 align:middle line:84%
I think coincidence is God's
way of remaining anonymous.

00:04:46.782 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.382 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:04:49.382 --> 00:04:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I think God's way of
remaining anonymous,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
that's a coincidence.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.087 align:middle line:84%
And I think accidents
are divine interactions.

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think we're
just thrown down here.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I think we come back to
the schoolroom to learn,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
to learn many, many lessons.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Now the hardest
lessons in your life

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.311 align:middle line:84%
are probably the ones-- the most
difficult ones are the hardest

00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
People in your life that
you have difficult times

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
with-- mostly family
members, right?

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Families and people that
mean so much to you,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
they'll push your
buttons, because they're

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
going to teach you
something about yourself.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't
learn-- if it was easy,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
what are you going
to learn from that?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.131 align:middle line:84%
So if you have somebody
standing right before you

00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and challenging you on different
aspects of who you are,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.829 align:middle line:84%
what choices you're
making, they're

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
going to teach you
something about yourself

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and how you deal
with each other.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So remember, this is your
schoolroom down here.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to wait
until your life is finished

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the other side
of life, and you look back

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh, I
should have done better.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
If only I knew then
what I know now,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.225 align:middle line:84%
I would have made
better choices.

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I'd have chosen love
instead of fear.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.445 align:middle line:84%
So let this time together
here-- because we will never

00:05:53.445 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:90%
be together again.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
This will be the only
time that all of us

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
are here in this space,
holding this space, yes?

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So make the most of it.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Make the most of this
moment right now.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully this
will change your life

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
if you want it
to, if you let it.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And if it's just me
reminding you of who you are,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that you're a soul having
an experience-- then fine.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:90%
That's enough.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Because just that little
bit will throw you

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
right on your journey, throw you
on your path, and change you.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.282 align:middle line:84%
When you open up
your mind and you

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:84%
start bringing that higher
consciousness, that higher

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:90%
awareness, miracles happen.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Miracles happen.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.384 align:middle line:90%
You know, God says yes.

00:06:31.384 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:90%
So God is always saying yes.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And I believe we are all God.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe that our sparks
are that God light.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.962 align:middle line:84%
And I think this God
says yes, yes, yes.

00:06:38.962 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, why is it that sometimes
things don't work out for us

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
and we get frustrated?

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, well, no, no, no.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.519 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we have things in our
life that we've always wanted?

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we can't.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Because our egos say no.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:90%
The human part of us says no.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to
remember that, ego.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.409 align:middle line:90%
E-G-O-- Edging God Out.

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
Let me repeat that.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.033 align:middle line:90%
That was a good one.

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:05.151 align:middle line:90%
E-G-O, Edging God Out.

00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you could
just be in alignment

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.393 align:middle line:84%
to that God self
and that awareness,

00:07:08.393 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
yes, you'll be more
into your source energy.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.636 align:middle line:84%
You'll be representing
your truth,

00:07:13.636 --> 00:07:15.010 align:middle line:84%
you'll be recognizing
your truth,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be living your truth.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're down
here, to remember our truth.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it takes the
death of a loved one

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.634 align:middle line:84%
to push us back on our path, to
get back on our spiritual path.

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I have some of
you in the audience--

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel it-- that's
happened to you.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I've worked many, many times
with parents who lost children,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and I find that the parents
would not have known anything

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
about spirituality,
anything about themselves,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
their soul selves, if
that event did not occur.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to go one
step further by saying

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.450 align:middle line:84%
maybe those souls
agreed to that situation

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:90%
back on the spirit side of life.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the soul of the
child and the parents

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
sat around with
their guide and said,

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
we have to have a
situation here that

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
will force us into
our spirituality.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that soul of the
child said, you know what?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I go
first, and that'll

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
force you to question things
and ask questions about things.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you know,
you left early in 1500s.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Now I gotta back
that up with karma.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to remember
everything is balanced.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything is karma.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So if that soul of
the child, you know,

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
the parent might have died
in another lifetime early,

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and now that child
has to go early

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.700 align:middle line:84%
so you learn from both
sides of the coin.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, right?

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.522 align:middle line:90%
It's very well-rounded.

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So today what I would
like to do with you

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
is also talk a little bit
about forgiveness, yes?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is an incredible,
incredible spiritual tool,

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a lot for
us to forgive another.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
And talking about forgiveness
just for a second,

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say that
we have to be better than.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And we always have
to be learning.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
We always have to be willing
to learn, to teach, to be.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.085 align:middle line:84%
I think forgiveness
is a wonderful lesson.

00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Spirit comes through many
times saying, I'm really sorry.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Please forgive me.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And we find out that we're
so quick to judge others.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We're so fast to just
judge another person

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:84%
without knowing
their back story.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't know why they
behaved a certain way.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something happened
in their childhood

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.940 align:middle line:84%
that made them act a
certain way later on.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:90%
I find that's a lot of it.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of the
back story, yeah?

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.479 align:middle line:84%
So no one is better
than anybody else.

00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:90%
We're all the same.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
We're all in it together.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I just ask you to--
once you stop and you

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.125 align:middle line:84%
go into judgment really fast,
just stop and pause and say,

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:84%
hm, why am I judging
this other individual?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Why am I feeling better than?

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:84%
What is it about myself that
needs to come into balance?

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that, you
know, I have to judge them

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.640 align:middle line:90%
and I can't relate to that.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
What is their back story?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then instead of
throwing that out there

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and judging them,
step into compassion.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Step into compassion.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if you did something
you weren't very proud of,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.700 align:middle line:84%
you'd want someone to
forgive you, wouldn't you?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have
the whole story behind it.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
compassion comes in.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Try to demonstrate compassion.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And be the teacher.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Be the light to show others, OK?

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
That's my message today
for you, and for you.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.631 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And now I thought we
would just-- since we

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.505 align:middle line:84%
have this opportunity and
we have some people here,

00:10:09.505 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:84%
your lovely smiling selves--
thank you very much.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
If you have any
general questions

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.355 align:middle line:84%
you would like to ask me,
which I hopefully can answer,

00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:18.096 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like to.

00:10:18.096 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:90%
I knew you had a question.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I must be psychic.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.407 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have you
stand, Lorraine, so everyone

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:84%
can see you and
can hear you here.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.427 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: My question to you
is what happens when you die?

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When
you die, the spirit

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:90%
leaves the physical body.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:90%
And there is no pain in death.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So leading up to death
might be painful.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's a disease,
like cancer or something that

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
really depletes the body's
energy, the prana, we call it,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:90%
the energy system in the body.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens is
there's no pain in death.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.517 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is very
freed from this casing,

00:10:47.517 --> 00:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's a freeness,
there's an openness.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
There's an openness
of consciousness.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.139 align:middle line:84%
But there's no pain,
and they're around you.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're much
more aware of things

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
than we are here in this
three-dimensional world.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like with this
three-dimensional world,

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:90%
we have, like, blinders on.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:90%
We can't see fully.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
But they know more
about love on that side.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.300 align:middle line:90%
They accept things more.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:90%
They see the whole picture.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Question?

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.211 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And let me just
say before you ask

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
your question,
what is your name?

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Darielle.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.685 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Darielle.

00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Darielle.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.255 align:middle line:84%
And Darielle, you're
a great energy.

00:11:16.255 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I just want to tell you that
because your energy's fabulous.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.386 align:middle line:84%
I can see auras and
I can feel auras,

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
but I just want
to say that you--

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:90%
you've done some good work.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.152 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
continue doing more work

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and stop questioning yourself,
because you tend to question

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.068 align:middle line:84%
yourself and you've got that
analytical thing all the time.

00:11:31.068 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
But you're fine.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Just go with it and
breathe into it.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:90%
You'll be fine.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Just had to
say that before you asked

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:90%
to the question.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: How accurate.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:90%
You must be a psychic.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.584 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I
must be psychic.

00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Or psycho.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.629 align:middle line:90%
They haven't found out yet.

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: So my question that
I hear from a lot of people,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and myself as well, is how does
one bring forth their gifts

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and their talents and
use them to contribute,

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.782 align:middle line:90%
to make the world better?

00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:52.739 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Great, great-- great question.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And more people are
asking that question.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Many more people are asking
about their own spirituality,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
their own soul's journey,
their own destiny, if you will.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And I find that the best
way, the optimal way, for you

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to explore that about yourself
is to go into the silence.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Is to go into the stillness
of the silence, yes?

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.805 align:middle line:84%
And really when you sit in that
meditative state, if you will.

00:12:18.805 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking
about-- we're

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
going to do a meditation in
just a couple minutes here,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
but you don't necessarily have
to go to a formal meditation.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Just paying attention
to your breath

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.949 align:middle line:84%
and closing down your
eyes and coming back

00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:29.210 align:middle line:90%
to the center of your heart.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It seems like--
you know, the soul

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:84%
is tucked right
behind the heart.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So the more we can get in
there and feel that energy,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and just be aware of it
and live from our truth--

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.606 align:middle line:90%
not from the head.

00:12:42.606 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if we live
from the head,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
rationalize everything,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:84%
we're going to analyze,
we're going to overanalyze.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And the soul isn't
about the brain.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The soul's part of the mind,
the mind part of the soul.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
The brain rationalizes things,
try to figure things out.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to get
your answers that way.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.372 align:middle line:90%
It's more like your soul.

00:12:58.372 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're
going to go to.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So the more you can go into your
soul, the silence of the soul,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and feel things
and know things--

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.362 align:middle line:90%
I call it your knowingness.

00:13:07.362 --> 00:13:08.945 align:middle line:84%
And so the best thing
is kind of where

00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I shut off this a little
bit, the rational mindset,

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.942 align:middle line:84%
and go more into the soul
energy, the heart energy.

00:13:13.942 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you get
your information from.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're knowing
this, and then you

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.274 align:middle line:90%
gotta start trusting it.

00:13:18.274 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody's psychic,
from one degree or another.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.606 align:middle line:84%
We're all psychic, from
one degree or another.

00:13:22.606 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But you can give it
more force with trust,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:84%
when you trust yourself,
when you know yourself.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:90%
We've all been here before.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.526 align:middle line:90%
We've all been here before.

00:13:29.526 --> 00:13:31.983 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that's sitting
in this audience and everybody

00:13:31.983 --> 00:13:34.260 align:middle line:84%
at home, like I said earlier,
there are no accidents.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And you're meant to be
here, for whatever reason.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So I might do a reading
for one person over here,

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and somebody else over
here feels it, receives it,

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:90%
gets a healing by it.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
People that are at
home watching this,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
they might hear this one
message from somebody,

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:90%
and they'll get a healing.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.632 align:middle line:84%
So it's all the energy that
we're putting forth here.

00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.213 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.395 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what I'd like to do
is, before we do the readings,

00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to just
bring you all together

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
in a quick little
meditation, yes?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
And we'll do that.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.019 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never meditated
before, like I said, it's easy.

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
You've actually done it before,
but you don't know it, maybe.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Anybody don't think
they've meditated before?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.532 align:middle line:90%
You all meditated, OK.

00:14:16.532 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Of course, my audience.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:90%
They'll all be meditators.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what we're
going to do is I'm just

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
going to-- I'm going to
put this chair up here.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And I just want you to relax.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
it's just a moment for us
just to reconnect, yeah?

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking about
connecting to our soul self.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is my gift to
you-- to you, as well, yes?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you're at home, you
can just close your eyes

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.215 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the
music behind my voice.

00:14:40.215 --> 00:14:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And everybody here
in the studio,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
you as well can just close your
eyes and listen to my voice,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and I'll just guide you.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Just a little journey.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to, during
the day, to take some time out,

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:90%
just to be with ourselves.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
We worry so much about what
other people think of us,

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:90%
instead of just being us.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So now is your
opportunity just to be.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Just to be.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.382 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are things, and you
create with your thoughts.

00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So at this moment,
I just want you,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes just
closed, just relax.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Just relax and place your
awareness, your mindfulness,

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts, upon your body.

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
The heart that's pumping
blood to the cells

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.385 align:middle line:90%
and the organs and the muscles.

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And just place your
awareness, your mindfullness,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of your feet,
all the way down to the bottom

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of your feet, which
is also part of you.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And as you bring
that awareness down

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of
your feet, be mindful

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that you as a soul
being, as a light being,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
are not limited by
the physical body.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But you as a soul, as this
beautiful, brilliant light

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.036 align:middle line:84%
that you are, extends way
down through to Mother Earth,

00:16:05.036 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
that Mother Earth

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
energy, that beautiful,
nurturing energy that

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.920 align:middle line:90%
sustains our lives.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Nature is incredible.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth-- we thank Gaia so
much that she gives us so much.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Now is our time to give
her some gratitude,

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to give her respect for
all that she does for us.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's now thank her, give her
gratitude, our appreciation.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And in your own mind,
in your own way,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
just have thoughts appreciating
Gaia, thanking her for all

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
that she gives us.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.045 align:middle line:84%
And just feel, as you
give out gratitude,

00:16:50.045 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
as you give out thankfulness
and appreciation,

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
how does that resonate
within your own body?

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:90%
How is that space?

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Just feel that.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.534 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:17:06.534 --> 00:17:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
You as a soul being are a
brilliant, brilliant light.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.774 align:middle line:90%
Top of your head.

00:17:15.774 --> 00:17:17.565 align:middle line:84%
Just place your
mindfulness, your awareness

00:17:17.565 --> 00:17:21.099 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of the head.

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you place your awareness
at the top of the head,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.716 align:middle line:84%
be mindful also that
you receive information,

00:17:28.716 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
you receive energy,
from the heaven worlds,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
from the cosmic energy,
the cosmic light.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, dear friends, if you
could of a bright golden star,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
far, far, above
you, far, far away.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Way beyond our space and time.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And just be aware of this
beautiful golden light,

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.026 align:middle line:90%
this golden star.

00:17:54.026 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it comes down, this
heavenly energy, touches

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:84%
the top of your head, and
swims through your whole body,

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:90%
through your whole beingness.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Just feel that light.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:90%
And just sit with that.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
How does that feel
to you as you connect

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
with that heavenly light?

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
That sense of knowingness,
that sense of truth,

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:90%
that sense of oneness.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:84%
That sense of
harmony, connectedness

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.585 align:middle line:84%
to the source
energy, to the light.

00:18:31.585 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Now just now place your
mind upon your heart,

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:46.551 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful center of
healing, of balance, of love.

00:18:46.551 --> 00:18:50.105 align:middle line:84%
And see that lovely
center with a green light.

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:53.274 align:middle line:90%
That green light is sent forth.

00:18:53.274 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And throw it in front
of you, that green light

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:90%
from your heart.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And in front of you, create
a beautiful green ball,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
a crystal green ball
of healing light.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Green crystal healing
ball of light.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Just create that
with your thoughts,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.450 align:middle line:90%
with your energy from the heart.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful green crystal
healing ball of light

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
has very important properties.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:90%
It brings healing.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:90%
It brings balance.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:90%
It brings harmony.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the middle of this green
crystal healing ball of light,

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to place
a person in your life

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%
that you need to forgive.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Send them some forgiveness.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Let them stand in the middle
of this crystal green healing

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.178 align:middle line:84%
ball of light and
receive your healing.

00:19:46.178 --> 00:19:49.157 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.157 --> 00:19:49.657 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:52.142 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:52.142 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful of how it feels
when you give forth healing

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to another, how it
resonates within your body,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
in your space.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And now place yourself in the
middle of this green crystal

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:90%
healing ball of light.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Place yourself and receive the
healing, an emotional healing,

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:84%
physical healing, spiritual
healing, and mental healing.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Remembering who you are
as a soul being of light.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And just feel that loving
energy for yourself.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.265 align:middle line:84%
And thank the universe
for bringing you

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:44.223 align:middle line:90%
to where you are today.

00:20:44.223 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And as we sit in
that space of love,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
we ask the spirit world
to come close to us

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:84%
now as we speak to them and we
say, divine heavenly parent, we

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
ask your blessing upon
this meeting today.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to me.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends,
speak clear to me.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Give us glimpses of eternity.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Let us know that you are free.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Give us names and
facts and places.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Help us to remember
heaven's graces.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Send your thoughts upon me
with emotion and simplicity

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
as we sit together in
peace, love, and harmony.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.546 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I had the advantage of sitting
here and being very, very

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:84%
aware of how your aura changes,
the energy around you changes,

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
and it really is amazing.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You went through great changes
here toward the second half.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:90%
When you got it, you took off.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.865 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:22:02.865 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I see the
shift in the energy.

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm in my
head, I'm in my head.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.526 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
dropped to your heart,

00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
you were right there.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And I always say to people,
when you're busy in your head,

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.256 align:middle line:84%
just put your head
to your heart.

00:22:15.256 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.626 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:18.679 align:middle line:90%
Here to here.

00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
Goes right to your heart.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.540 align:middle line:84%
When you do things from your
heart, your soul changed.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:90%
Did you have a good experience?

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.951 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you something.

00:22:25.951 --> 00:22:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I think you try too hard to
be what other people want

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
you to be, instead
of being who you are.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to continue
to do things in your own way

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and in your own pace.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's a unique
individual, and everybody

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
does things in their own
timing and their own belief

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
systems and their
own soul makeup.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And by us just being who we are
and genuine with who we are,

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.240 align:middle line:84%
we can help that
person and that person

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and that person and that person.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And we never even know
the rippling effect

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
that who we are, standing
tall in our power,

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.054 align:middle line:84%
will affect that person to be
who they are, and so forth.

00:23:01.054 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
give that to you

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.636 align:middle line:84%
because there was a part
where I was looking at you,

00:23:04.636 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
where it was-- not sure of
this, not sure of myself.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.245 align:middle line:90%
And I got it.

00:23:08.245 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's a real strong
spiritual gifts you have,

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:90%
you know that?

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:90%
You could be a healer.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I feel if you gave enough
energy into your healing work

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and believed in
it, it'll blossom.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think you're
just finding things out

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:90%
and you're learning things.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:90%
But does that make sense?

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
I hope it makes sense.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.296 align:middle line:90%
I hope it makes sense to you.

00:23:24.296 --> 00:23:26.004 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to let
you know that you're

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
really-- you're great
because you have the brain,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
you have the mind, but the
spirit is there, as well.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And if I could bring those
together for you, great.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:90%
So good for you.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And just be yourself, yeah?

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.134 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:37.134 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I thought
I would do now--

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:90%
any questions before we start?

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:90%
You all ready to rock and roll?

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Aaaahhh!

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I just like doing that,
the meditation, because I

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
find that so much
happens on that space,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and so much happens
that we were hiding,

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
or we're putting down so
long in our childhood,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
or we didn't realize
that that person who

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.897 align:middle line:84%
comes into your crystal ball,
healing ball-- you don't expect

00:23:58.897 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:90%
some of those people to show up.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you forgive,
it frees up everything.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you something,
when you forgive others,

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:90%
it also-- you forgive yourself.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:90%
You're forgiving yourself.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're throwing away
the old, stale energy

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're bringing
new energy in.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And we live with new energy.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.090 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to blend with spirit

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and receive
information from them.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
If I come to you,
please say yes.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.759 align:middle line:84%
And if it makes sense
to you, say yes.

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't
make sense, say no,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.690 align:middle line:90%
because you're helping them.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:84%
We sit here today for the
goodness of the spirit world.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.403 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody came here
maybe to get a reading,

00:24:33.403 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:84%
or maybe-- I don't know
why you're here to see me.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But so you're here, but
you're also here for them,

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of them.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Because as you're
sitting here today,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:84%
you can heal those in the
spirit world, as well.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:90%
So it happens.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And those people
that are watching,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
remember that you can
heal those in the spirit

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.434 align:middle line:84%
just by your being here and
in this space of openness.

00:24:53.434 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can start hearing
spirit come through to you

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:90%
on your own.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Might not happen
during the show,

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
but it'll happen tonight
when you're going to sleep,

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.196 align:middle line:84%
or it might happen
in the morning.

00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:02.135 align:middle line:84%
So just be aware we're
setting the space here.

00:25:02.135 --> 00:25:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is
I'm tuned to the spirit,

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.287 align:middle line:84%
and I will be just
working with it.

00:25:06.287 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
If it makes sense, say
I'm with you with me.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'll try to bring through
more of the information.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.326 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:11.326 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to start.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I have a lady here.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I know the lady's on the
side of me right here.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I feel she's older than younger.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little bit
older in my age.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I really
was struck down,

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to say that I
feel an illness of some kind,

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like I'm really not
breathing well toward my end.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm-- I
know that I'm over here,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and I think I'm with you,
so I know-- I'm with you.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.537 align:middle line:90%
So what is your name?

00:25:35.537 --> 00:25:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Bonnie.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Bonnie.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So Bonnie, we're going to--
is it OK if I come to you?

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:90%
So I have a lady here.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are two ladies
here and there's a man here.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go to
Bonnie if that's good.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And Bonnie, I'm
going to ask you--

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:84%
if you don't mind
standing up, Bonnie.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK, please, sweetheart?

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So I have two ladies here
and I have a gentleman here.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I feel this might be a
father figure to you,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.084 align:middle line:90%
and I'm over here on the side.

00:25:54.084 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk to
you about that in a second,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:56.834 align:middle line:90%
but-- huh.

00:25:56.834 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about-- did
your mother also pass over,

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:25:59.520 --> 00:25:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hm.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel I have a father,
a mother, and another woman.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Now this woman is
close to you, so it

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:84%
would be a sister of
yours or sister-in-law.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:07.654 align:middle line:90%
So sister, yes?

00:26:07.654 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Could be.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I want to
talk about illness, by the way.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think she might
have been struck down

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.690 align:middle line:90%
with an illness of some kind.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.800 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I just want you
to be with her and be with me.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk--
she's coming in very, very

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.880 align:middle line:90%
close here.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And-- yeah, go on.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:90%
I love her energy.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I love her openness
to doing this.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I think on the Earth
world, when she was down here,

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this would be a
part of your guys' growing up.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this
would have been

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
a part of your
family type of thing.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:90%
So it makes sense to you?

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
she really wants to be here.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Now were you guys separated
by distance in some way,

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
as far as
geographically, please?

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She was
a lot older than I am.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:44.956 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:44.956 --> 00:26:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I know that she's talking to
me about separated from you,

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.395 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't able to see
you before she passes over, OK?

00:26:50.395 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
if you were going

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.547 align:middle line:84%
to make a special
trip to see her,

00:26:53.547 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't if you were
planning on making a trip,

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure if you
didn't make the trip

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.913 align:middle line:90%
or it didn't happen.

00:26:57.913 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It didn't happen.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get to see her.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you very much.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
she's talking about.

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.558 align:middle line:84%
She's just acknowledging
that, that it didn't happen,

00:27:04.558 --> 00:27:07.552 align:middle line:84%
and she wants you to
forgive yourself for that.

00:27:07.552 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I know
you needed to hear that.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, yes, yes.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So I know
you needed to hear that.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I know she's telling
me, oh, please stop.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Stop doing that yourself.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Stop doing that to yourself.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.745 align:middle line:84%
I know there'll be a
gentleman over there with her,

00:27:18.745 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and I feel it might be a
brother, a brother that

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.849 align:middle line:90%
comes in, OK?

00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And I feel the brother
came before she did,

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
so he must have
passed before her.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know this
man comes in and he's walking

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.856 align:middle line:84%
in like this, and he's
kind of owning the space.

00:27:30.856 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:90%
He's like, I'm here as well.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.642 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention to me.

00:27:33.642 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Very handsome
man when he was younger.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.475 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: He was kind of
a looker when he was younger.

00:27:37.475 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.892 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And the
people look at him, wow,

00:27:38.892 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:90%
he's a handsome guy.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.310 align:middle line:90%
He's a handsome guy.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I don't want to say he's
a ladies' man, but in that time

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.416 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't, but he
could have been.

00:27:44.416 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.265 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
It's weird, right?

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.546 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So,
and I don't know why,

00:27:49.546 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:90%
but I'm seeing Lucky brand.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:53.887 align:middle line:84%
Now I know Lucky brand is a jean
brand, but I see Lucky brand.

00:27:53.887 --> 00:27:55.220 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what that means.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he
smoked Lucky cigarettes?

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's
very true, yes.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Lucky cigarettes.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Lucky is the brand.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So when he comes into my space
and he lives that mindfulness

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:84%
at that point, it would
have been the '50s or '40s.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
This is the time.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm smoking,
so I know that Lucky brand

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:90%
cigarettes.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.883 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:28:10.883 --> 00:28:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.074 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Wild, OK.

00:28:13.074 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
You never know what
you're going to get,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.449 align:middle line:84%
so that's why you
gotta keep on doing it.

00:28:16.449 --> 00:28:18.073 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
mother is with him,

00:28:18.073 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:90%
so I know your mom is here.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And I know this'll
be your sister, then,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:84%
that comes in as well, then,
with the one you can see.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.632 align:middle line:84%
Now let me just
go to your sister

00:28:24.632 --> 00:28:25.840 align:middle line:90%
here, because she's laughing.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, ha ha ha ha.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.182 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about the gold watch.

00:28:29.182 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So there must be a gold
watch that either your mother

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.490 align:middle line:84%
or your sister
had, a gold watch.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I
believe my mother did.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.133 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know--
I see this gold watch,

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:84%
where I see-- oh boy, it's
like a little bit of-- mm,

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Like strings.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.486 align:middle line:90%
Well, not strings, but metal.

00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Metal.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Chains.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:45.626 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Chains.

00:28:45.626 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Chains, yes.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Because she's
projected this gold

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.404 align:middle line:84%
watch with the little
chains, two chains, on it.

00:28:53.404 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know
February would be significant

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So would that
be a birthday or something?

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you very much.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.699 align:middle line:84%
We know that February
is very significant.

00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:02.022 align:middle line:90%
I want to go toward the 18th.

00:29:02.022 --> 00:29:02.789 align:middle line:90%
Toward the 18th.

00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that's it,
but right there at the 18th.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.027 align:middle line:84%
I want to go with a
candle set that you have.

00:29:07.027 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you have a
candelabras or candle holders.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Make sense to you?

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And-- got you.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:12.805 align:middle line:90%
Thank you much.

00:29:12.805 --> 00:29:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Your mother's pushing right in
here, your sister's over here,

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and your father's here,
and the brother's here.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.824 align:middle line:90%
Got to tell you that.

00:29:17.824 --> 00:29:19.740 align:middle line:84%
They want me to all tell
you what's happening.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm
giving you roses.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you
tons of roses now.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.954 align:middle line:90%
Roses, roses, OK?

00:29:24.954 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
significance that has,

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:90%
but I need to give you roses.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.407 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk about an
oil painting in your house.

00:29:31.407 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That painting.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you have the one that
belonged to your mother

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
in the house?

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:90%
The painting?

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, got you.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.655 align:middle line:84%
So I know it would be a scenery
painting, oil on canvas.

00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have one,
but it wasn't my mother's.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.085 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Whose
was it, please?

00:29:46.085 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh, it's--

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Just yours?

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Just mine, mm-hm.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.809 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Hm, don't like that.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Don't like that.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.523 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's something
about an oil painting.

00:29:52.523 --> 00:29:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.839 align:middle line:90%
Got it, got it.

00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Your mother comes to
visit you, your father

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:90%
comes to visit you-- hold on.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And the sister is
running in here.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:90%
So I understand that.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.665 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to
that oil painting,

00:30:05.665 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I know something would
have recently happened

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:90%
to that oil painting.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if they're going
to change the framing in that,

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.255 align:middle line:84%
or something might
have fallen down

00:30:12.255 --> 00:30:13.380 align:middle line:90%
and I gotta put it back up.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Where there's something--

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: We do
have to put it back up.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.289 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was like-- OK,
why are you showing me this?

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:90%
If that makes sense.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So they just want me to tell you
that that's why they're there.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And your father is taking
care of everything.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm in
control, I'm in control,

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's who he is.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.324 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that you have
your sister's phone book

00:30:31.324 --> 00:30:31.990 align:middle line:90%
or address book.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I
don't want to say

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:90%
it's like a little spiral one.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure of that,
the spiral thing.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.632 align:middle line:84%
And if I open it up, I do
find pencil writing in that.

00:30:41.632 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.715 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
if you open up that spiral

00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:47.990 align:middle line:84%
telephone book, in the
front part of that book,

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:50.252 align:middle line:84%
on the cover, on the inside,
is also writing also.

00:30:50.252 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So there are people's
names and phone numbers

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:90%
on the cover of that book.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:55.365 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:30:55.365 --> 00:30:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And she's showing
that very clearly.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.242 align:middle line:84%
Now if I also go to
that book, I know

00:30:59.242 --> 00:31:01.450 align:middle line:84%
if I go to the very front
of that cover of that book,

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.815 align:middle line:90%
there might be a flower.

00:31:02.815 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: There were flowers
on the cover of the book.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's showing me.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's
what she's showing me?

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:08.940 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I like that.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:90%
She's very detailed.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Now why would she
be with Lorraine?

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Why would Lorraine, the name
Lorraine-- L-O-R-R-A-I-N-E.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important that
you know Lorraine is here,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:90%
or Lorraine is with me.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So Lorraine, and that's
very strongly spelled out.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.851 align:middle line:90%
Can't place Lorraine?

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Not Lonnie?

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, are
you sure it's not Lonnie?

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, Lonnie.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.490 align:middle line:90%
It could be Lonnie.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't take things,
but L-O-N-- that's it.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that her name?

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.615 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No

00:31:34.615 --> 00:31:35.560 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Whose name is that?

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's his, his name.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is
that your husband?

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's my son.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Your son.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:90%
He's passed over as well?

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:40.390 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
OK, I'm sorry, OK.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.800 align:middle line:90%
So that must be the Lonnie.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I just make sure I
get more from him

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
to make sure it's definitely
him and we've locked things in.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:47.755 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:47.755 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Got it.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.228 align:middle line:90%
Got it, got it, I've got you.

00:31:49.228 --> 00:31:51.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, I got it, thank you.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you, he's
also with all of these people,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.793 align:middle line:90%
all of these people.

00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I passed quickly, by the way.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.145 align:middle line:90%
I passed very fast.

00:31:58.145 --> 00:31:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Is this your brother?

00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing too, love?

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:01.789 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:02.705 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:32:02.705 --> 00:32:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Darlene.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Darlene.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to use one
microphone for both of you, OK?

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So Darlene, you're very
much like your brother

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.330 align:middle line:90%
in many respects.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.230 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
planting something for him.

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the thought
about planting some roses or a

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:15.795 align:middle line:90%
rose bush for him.

00:32:15.795 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She
plants all the time.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Was there a rose
bush or something you picked

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.490 align:middle line:84%
out for him, to plant
after he passed over?

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:90%
You're saying yes.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.156 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:23.156 --> 00:32:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, well, that--
that just fits her perfect.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: How long
ago did he pass over?

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:28.454 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: 26 years.

00:32:28.454 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: 26 years ago.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.079 align:middle line:84%
So if I go to the back of the
house-- not sure whose house.

00:32:32.079 --> 00:32:34.453 align:middle line:84%
But is there a rose garden in
someone's back or someone's

00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:34.954 align:middle line:90%
side alley?

00:32:34.954 --> 00:32:35.953 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I-- I have.

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You have.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Would you also have some kind
of a statuary thing there,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.674 align:middle line:84%
a bird bath or some
kind of statue?

00:32:41.674 --> 00:32:42.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: She does.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That would be me.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
That would be you.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So I know that your
brother talks about roses.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I know there's garden there, and
there's trees, and I'm there.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.235 align:middle line:90%
Who has the horses?

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, I have
neighbors that have horses.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So if I'm
standing in that garden,

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.285 align:middle line:90%
can I look over and see horses?

00:32:55.285 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because he's
showing me where he was

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:57.728 align:middle line:90%
the other day with you.

00:32:57.728 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Understand?

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:00.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where he
was the other day.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And you knew he was there
because he came to your mind,

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.408 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: He
shifted into your mind,

00:33:06.408 --> 00:33:07.669 align:middle line:90%
and it really made an impact.

00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's cool.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Cool, right?

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.397 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:10.397 --> 00:33:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, cool.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:84%
His head is affected, by
the way, when he passes.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.000 align:middle line:90%
It's quick.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't why, but he's quick.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:90%
He passed very fast, didn't he?

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: He was shot.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.253 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: With a gun.

00:33:20.253 --> 00:33:21.432 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Was it
was a rifle or something?

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:23.726 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Shotgun.

00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:24.434 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:24.434 --> 00:33:27.286 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Shotgun rifle, OK.

00:33:27.286 --> 00:33:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Can I say an
accident around here?

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Can I say that something
should not have happened?

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Should something
not have happened?

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if suicide--
I don't want to say that.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It wasn't suicide.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Did someone
shoot him, or was something--

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to say that--
was it a man that did this?

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.597 align:middle line:84%
Like an associate, a boyfriend,
a friend of some kind?

00:33:44.597 --> 00:33:45.805 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It was a friend.

00:33:45.805 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because I
got to tell you something.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.202 align:middle line:84%
There's an argument
that pursues beforehand.

00:33:49.202 --> 00:33:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh my god.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:50.712 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:50.712 --> 00:33:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
There's an argument,

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and he's giving me this feeling
and a scenario of an argument.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
explosion of energy.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you, though,
I think his head is affected.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if he was shot in
the head or shot in the chest.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: The chest.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, but why
is his head affected, too?

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Were there two shots?

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.027 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No, it was--

00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: One to the heart?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:08.862 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:08.862 --> 00:34:10.070 align:middle line:90%
I think there were two shots.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.429 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one-- I don't
know why my head.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Did he fall down
and hit his head?

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it was?

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:13.889 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: He could
have hit his head.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:14.699 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I get the head.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:15.969 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to go
with what I'm getting.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:17.150 align:middle line:90%
I definitely get that.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.650 align:middle line:84%
I know something either
started inside then

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.649 align:middle line:84%
went outside, or outside
inside, but it's back and forth.

00:34:22.649 --> 00:34:24.155 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:24.155 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:90%
Who rides a motorcycle?

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: They both did.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.535 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
start with the motorcycle.

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.368 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have memories
about the motorcycle.

00:34:32.368 --> 00:34:35.592 align:middle line:84%
You know about the
motorcycle, got it.

00:34:35.592 --> 00:34:39.559 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw this at you,
but he's forgiven this guy.

00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.250 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.697 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
He's forgiven him.

00:34:44.697 --> 00:34:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Now this is amazing.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Today we're talking
about forgiveness.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.460 align:middle line:90%
He's forgiven this person.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I know he's their friend
or a family, distance,

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.862 align:middle line:90%
family member, distance-wise?

00:34:52.862 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:54.239 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:54.989 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.988 align:middle line:84%
And he's just-- he's
telling me he forgives him.

00:34:56.988 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:90%
And the women there.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And there was emotional stuff
going on, and money stuff also.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole bunch
of stuff going on.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Who built the house afterwards?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.855 align:middle line:84%
Was there someone
that built the house?

00:35:06.855 --> 00:35:07.925 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: They
are building one.

00:35:07.925 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You're
building your house now?

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say tell you that
your brother's on top of it

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.631 align:middle line:90%
and your father's on top of it?

00:35:12.631 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:84%
They're all on top of
these, building a house.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.275 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that you had
to change the plans.

00:35:18.275 --> 00:35:21.004 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER] We're
always changing the plans.

00:35:21.004 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I know you just
recently changed the plans.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.965 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There's
definitely a change of plans.

00:35:24.965 --> 00:35:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Just recently.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Many times.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know the upstairs
area, that changed.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.060 align:middle line:84%
There's something
come up, either we

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
had to changed things around
there, put an extra bedroom.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Something was changed with that.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: We're tearing
out a wall, and yeah,

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:90%
adding on to the dining room.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But I know that your
brother's around there.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I know you have old
photos of me, he said.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:90%
You've old photos of me.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not who I look like now,
but he says, old photos of me.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.415 align:middle line:90%
Now why is there a tattoo?

00:35:50.415 --> 00:35:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Did he have a tattoo?

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Was someone going to get a
heart tattoo or something?

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And this was a long time ago.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, he was
buried with a heart necklace.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:57.766 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:35:57.766 --> 00:35:58.265 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:58.265 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Could be it.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Did that belong to you,
that heart necklace?

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, it was
with his girlfriend.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: His girlfriend.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:04.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, OK.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.745 align:middle line:84%
Well, I gotta tell you, I'm
going to leave you with that.

00:36:06.745 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But all-- your sister brought
through your whole family

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:90%
and your brother.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being here.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.420 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.045 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:36:14.045 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.417 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

00:36:16.417 --> 00:36:21.830 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I never know how things
are going to work.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
part of doing this.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:84%
You never know what's
going to happen.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So you never know
what's going to happen.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do now is I'd

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
like to do something different
and show you another way

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.340 align:middle line:90%
to connect with spirit.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And this way is really
by using a photograph

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with spirit that
way and tuning in that way.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.787 align:middle line:90%
So I would like to do that.

00:36:38.787 --> 00:36:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And someone has a
photograph of a loved one?

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:90%
You do?

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind, sweetheart,
coming up on stage?

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we can do it over here?

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
So we have-- your name is?

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Samantha.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.269 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Samantha.

00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And Samantha brought a photo of
this-- you said your grandma?

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.055 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: There's
her grandmother.

00:36:52.055 --> 00:36:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.064 align:middle line:84%
And I know, Samantha,
you just said--

00:36:56.064 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and we have a small
audience here,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:90%
but I think your family is here?

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Other family members are here?

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:90%
And this is your grandmother.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.446 align:middle line:90%
Your daughter-- daughter's here?

00:37:04.446 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's my mom.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's your mom.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, so.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: And
that's my daughter.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.218 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
this is your daughter.

00:37:09.218 --> 00:37:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So pay extra attention
to what happens.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And Samantha, some things
you might not know,

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.440 align:middle line:90%
your mom might now.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I'm just
going to ask for her first

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:16.800 align:middle line:90%
name.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.812 align:middle line:90%
Does it begin with an M?

00:37:17.812 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: M-A something?

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:90%
M-A-S?

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:90%
M-A-S-E?

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: M-A-B. Mabel.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.196 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Mabel, Mabel.

00:37:24.196 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to
tune in to Mabel.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And just let me tell you how
I tune in to spirit here.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.938 align:middle line:90%
I'm tuning in to Mabel.

00:37:28.938 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just feeling the
energy of Mabel, yeah?

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.370 align:middle line:90%
And I love her energy.

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you something.

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
She is-- she'll give you a
quick kick in the rear end, OK?

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And this lady was not afraid
of using four-letter words,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.123 align:middle line:90%
can I just say that?

00:37:42.123 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.103 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So with her
personality, it's like,

00:37:45.103 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:90%
here you are, in your face.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.594 align:middle line:84%
Four-letter words are
natural and normal for her.

00:37:48.594 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And if she didn't use
four-letter words,

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.690 align:middle line:84%
you'd say, what's
wrong with her?

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Now I know this lady, I feel--
I feel an effervescence of life.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I feel an outgoingness
to this lady.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it-- of
course, she's prejudiced

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.800 align:middle line:84%
with her own
grandkids, you know.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And she'll give leeway to kids,
you know, her own grandkids.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:90%
But other kids, maybe not.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Now Mom-- so she's
coming over to you.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.719 align:middle line:84%
Was there a marriage that
didn't make it, please?

00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Was it two marriages
that she was in?

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Was she in two marriages?

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Three marriages.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I think she loved two.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
The third one, I don't
get a real connection.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.467 align:middle line:84%
The third one, she said it
was more of a companion.

00:38:25.467 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.320 align:middle line:90%
And who's Jimmy or Jim?

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.580 align:middle line:90%
You know a Jimmy?

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.682 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: A cousin?

00:38:30.682 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Cousin.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.465 align:middle line:84%
OK, and would she have known
Jimmy when she was younger?

00:38:33.465 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That would
be her little brother.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Her brother.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Her brother.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.945 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And has
passed over, correct?

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: My cousin.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Cousin with Jimmy.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got to ask you,
Samantha, she's talking to me.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:84%
She loves you more than life
itself and she gives you

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when you
were born, there was trouble.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.530 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you some
Kleenex, my love.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And crying, it really
heals the soul.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to feel free to,
because that's how we all heal,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.560 align:middle line:90%
from your experience.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.180 align:middle line:90%
All right, baby?

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So I gotta tell you,
I know that there

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.130 align:middle line:84%
might have been trouble
when she was born.

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Like either having
her-- there was

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
something with giving birth,
and it was touch-and-go

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.452 align:middle line:90%
for a little bit, yes?

00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it was.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:84%
OK so I know that she
brings me back to that time,

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that you're a very
special person,

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.945 align:middle line:84%
and she recognized that,
because you fought to be born.

00:39:18.945 --> 00:39:19.689 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:90%
You've heard the stories.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You fought to be born.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah?

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And are you
artistic, by the way?

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you like to do
artwork at all?

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:27.965 align:middle line:84%
Or have you thought about
expressing yourself with that?

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Um, I sing.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She's telling me
that you have something with

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:90%
artwork.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Either you've done some and
you're not showing people,

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:36.589 align:middle line:84%
or you're very private
and you put it away.

00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Photography?

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Photography.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Aren't there stills
that you've done?

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.641 align:middle line:90%
And-- I understand that.

00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:44.678 align:middle line:84%
She's talking like
a mile a minute.

00:39:44.678 --> 00:39:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Da-da-da-da-da-da.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
A mile a minute,
da-da-da-da-da-da.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know there would be
a separate area or a space

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.952 align:middle line:84%
that you have old
photographs of yours.

00:39:52.952 --> 00:39:54.285 align:middle line:90%
So do you like black-and-whites?

00:39:54.285 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Love them.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So would you know about-- when
she gives me the impression

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.019 align:middle line:84%
that there's black-and-whites
that you have

00:40:01.019 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't
really shown anyone.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It's your own
private collection,

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.900 align:middle line:84%
or you've put it
off to the side.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm sure. [LAUGHS]

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So it would
probably be in-- wow, honey.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.908 align:middle line:90%
It would be in that room.

00:40:11.908 --> 00:40:12.844 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:12.844 --> 00:40:13.312 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That room?

00:40:13.312 --> 00:40:14.353 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That room.

00:40:14.353 --> 00:40:16.359 align:middle line:84%
So it's a room that has
a lot of stuff in it.

00:40:16.359 --> 00:40:17.400 align:middle line:90%
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.682 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of stuff in
that room, do you understand?

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: So it
makes sense, right?

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.335 align:middle line:84%
So if I go into that room,
because she brings me

00:40:25.335 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:90%
in my mind.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.330 align:middle line:84%
She's bringing me into
that space and that room.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:32.946 align:middle line:84%
And um-- and-- love to you
dearly, but I just gotta say,

00:40:32.946 --> 00:40:34.320 align:middle line:84%
there might have
been times where

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I had to push open that
door because the stuff

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.100 align:middle line:90%
inside that room.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's
a true statement.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Does
that make sense, please?

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.543 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely.

00:40:44.543 --> 00:40:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Because she gives me that space.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.890 align:middle line:90%
And this is not a judgment.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.765 align:middle line:84%
This is just for her to
remember and give you

00:40:48.765 --> 00:40:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the memory of the living
and walking into that space.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.831 align:middle line:84%
And I know I had to
push things away.

00:40:52.831 --> 00:40:54.270 align:middle line:90%
Like I have stuff on the floor.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say hoarding, but I

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.680 align:middle line:84%
do want to say
collecting some things.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about bed covers
and bargains, like bargains.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Who goes-- shopping,
what, garage-

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That'd be my mom.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Your mom.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Did you give her some stuff
from a garage sale once,

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and give her some stuff?

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, my mom?

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.645 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
she go with you sometimes?

00:41:14.645 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And didn't she
try on the old clothes that

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.100 align:middle line:90%
were there as well.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:18.280 align:middle line:90%
There's--

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Some of the
clothes, because she's

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.937 align:middle line:84%
giving me-- I feel like I'm
trying on blouses and jackets,

00:41:21.937 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:90%
and it's like a yard sale.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like a yard sale.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And I'm going
there on a Saturday morning,

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.270 align:middle line:84%
at around 10 o'clock
in the morning.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going-- and who has
the pickup truck, please?

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.495 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She
had a pickup truck.

00:41:30.495 --> 00:41:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: She used to.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And she used
to have a pickup truck.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm getting
a pickup truck,

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in the pickup truck,
and I'm really going and getting

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.110 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And I like the sales.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.051 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of having a sale.

00:41:39.051 --> 00:41:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
buying it, but it's like, oh,

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:90%
there's a sale.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:41.920 align:middle line:90%
That's something--

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Right.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.923 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You know,
this is very, very funny.

00:41:44.923 --> 00:41:48.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's so interesting,
but throughout our day that we

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:84%
live every day, you
will draw to you,

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in your atmosphere, the spirit
people, those experiences

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in your life, by gesture
or thoughts that we create.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So I know that this lady
was with me all day today.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Now how do I know this?

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I know this lady was with
me because earlier today, I

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:84%
was talking to somebody
who worked for the show,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about going
to yard sales and garage sales.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit people
will use the information

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.410 align:middle line:84%
within your mind, and
I know that this lady

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:13.590 align:middle line:90%
loved doing that.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a passion, and
it was really fun, just

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.631 align:middle line:90%
finding the bargains.

00:42:16.631 --> 00:42:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bunch of crap
that you would never use, right?

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.315 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Which I still have.

00:42:20.315 --> 00:42:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Which I know,
a lot of it you still have.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Just saying.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And but it was part of the fun
of doing it, the adventure.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Now if I go to that room where
your photos are-- there's still

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:33.091 align:middle line:84%
stuff in the floor
and stuff, right?

00:42:33.091 --> 00:42:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It could
be her storage room.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Because she has all
of my grandma's stuff.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that this lady wants to go

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.710 align:middle line:84%
where a lot of her
things are still held.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yep,
that's my house.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: And
that's the room, right?

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.455 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:42.455 --> 00:42:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's the room.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.030 align:middle line:90%
So you're still--

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: That's the one you
have to push stuff around in.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: That's when
you gotta push it open.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But then your photographs
are in a different place?

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I do have mine
stored in a different place,

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:50.829 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: But I'm going
to go out on a limb and say you

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.380 align:middle line:84%
have some of your
photos in that room.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.545 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm sure.

00:42:56.545 --> 00:42:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes, there is
definitely lots of photos.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because
I know if I go there,

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:01.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's one closet
door or two closet doors,

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.660 align:middle line:90%
if I go into that room.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
leaning on the wall

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.140 align:middle line:90%
would be either photos of yours.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Right in that closet
area, there's some photos.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So you have to--
aren't there some

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that you want to have framed
but you never had framed?

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: There's some I've
talked about having framed.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because she's
telling me that recently,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.720 align:middle line:90%
you talked about that.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm
with you when you

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.610 align:middle line:84%
sit-in front of the television
set and sleep at night.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So very recently,
didn't you fall

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.782 align:middle line:84%
asleep in front
of the television?

00:43:27.782 --> 00:43:29.355 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Um, yeah.

00:43:29.355 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.813 align:middle line:84%
Now it might have
been three days ago,

00:43:31.813 --> 00:43:32.950 align:middle line:90%
but she was watching you.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:34.532 align:middle line:90%
Do you like football?

00:43:34.532 --> 00:43:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever like
to watch football

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:84%
on television or
sports of some kind?

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, but the last
time I actually really got

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:40.633 align:middle line:90%
into a game was with her.

00:43:40.633 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It must have a football game
you watched on TV with her.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.143 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:43:44.143 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I feel the love.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:90%
I feel that.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was a
moment you guys shared,

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and that was a memory
that you guys shared.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.050 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, amazing.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:84%
You feel the love for this
lady-- it's incredible.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell
you that she wanted

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:59.220 align:middle line:90%
to go when she wanted to go.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, she stayed--
oh, interesting.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.289 align:middle line:84%
And that her heart
is bad at one point.

00:44:03.289 --> 00:44:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Her heart
is bad at one point.

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:08.262 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Like-- [GASPING ]
I can't breath, and I'm like--

00:44:08.262 --> 00:44:08.887 align:middle line:90%
[RASPY PANTING]

00:44:08.887 --> 00:44:10.294 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't like operations.

00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:11.835 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't like
being in a hospital.

00:44:11.835 --> 00:44:13.870 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't want people to
tell her she needs a procedure.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:15.420 align:middle line:90%
She says, ah, I don't want that.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:90%
When I go, I go.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.310 align:middle line:90%
That's who she is.

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:18.655 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.071 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
know, she has--

00:44:20.071 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:84%
not to put any pressure
on you Samantha--

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.470 align:middle line:84%
but she has a lot
energy for you.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:27.199 align:middle line:84%
She looks after
you very strongly.

00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:29.615 align:middle line:84%
And she really wants you to
start taking care of yourself,

00:44:29.615 --> 00:44:30.671 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:32.170 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
care of yourself.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Some people that you're
around right now?

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't like 'em.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
not supporting you.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:38.904 align:middle line:84%
They're not nurturing
who you are.

00:44:38.904 --> 00:44:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.065 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:44:40.065 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I do.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I don't
like your fitting in,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.676 align:middle line:84%
trying to be something
to somebody else

00:44:43.676 --> 00:44:45.675 align:middle line:84%
because you want their
love or want to be there.

00:44:45.675 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:90%
The heck with that.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.080 align:middle line:84%
She wants you to be
you, and independent,

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and be who you are.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.809 align:middle line:84%
You're very artistic, you're
very talented, you really--

00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're also very good
with words, by the way,

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:55.974 align:middle line:90%
so you can describe things.

00:44:55.974 --> 00:44:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense, right?

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You can describe things-- have
you done work in a magazine,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.620 align:middle line:84%
writing a magazine
article or thinking

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.230 align:middle line:84%
about getting published
in a magazine?

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I have not.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She has had
has some poems published.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have
had poetry published.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: When
she was younger.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.333 align:middle line:84%
Just recently though,
she's telling me

00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:11.460 align:middle line:84%
about getting something
published in a magazine.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Got it, thank you.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.675 align:middle line:84%
She's pushing. boy,
she's pushing in.

00:45:14.675 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And even on that-- she
goes, with the buttons.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.710 align:middle line:84%
She's talking
about the internet.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Even there, she said.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So there might be a website
you've been looking at.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I was going to
submit photography to American

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Furniture Warehouse.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Hello?

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:25.819 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:45:25.819 --> 00:45:27.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:90%
So you need to do that, please.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.074 align:middle line:90%
Why would you not?

00:45:31.074 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.114 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Why would you not?

00:45:33.114 --> 00:45:35.320 align:middle line:90%
So you need to, all right?

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.840 align:middle line:90%
I gotta tell you that.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.445 align:middle line:90%
Um, by the way, she had cancer.

00:45:39.445 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.437 align:middle line:84%
I think that she didn't pass
away with that, necessarily.

00:45:44.437 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But I do think, 'cause she gives
me the impression-- she said,

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.530 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah, I had everything.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:90%
She has--

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: She did.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: I had everything.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And she's raspy in her voice.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:52.770 align:middle line:90%
I had everything.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:90%
That's how she's speaking.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.462 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:45:54.462 --> 00:45:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Is
this your sister?

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: No, she
was my sister-in-law.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH:
Your sister-in-law.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:58.759 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:45:58.759 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's one big family here.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It is.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Anybody on this
side can recognize this lady?

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:90%
So I love that raspiness.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:84%
I love her sense
of independence.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And she's her own
person, and that's

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:90%
what she wants you to take.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:10.765 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: I'm a lot like her.

00:46:10.765 --> 00:46:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She
wants you to take that.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Now why do you have
her old sewing basket?

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.554 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.554 --> 00:46:17.804 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Why do I have it?

00:46:17.804 --> 00:46:18.871 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have
her whole house.

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.995 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Sewing
basket, she said.

00:46:21.995 --> 00:46:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So he said you have
her old sewing basket,

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and one of the hinges
is not working on it.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you open it up, one of
the hinges is not working.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:33.580 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty wild, isn't it?

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It is.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And I want you-- the vases.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:84%
You have some of her
vases, as well, her vases.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.280 align:middle line:90%
You know, for flowers.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.460 align:middle line:90%
And she's showing me that.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.660 align:middle line:90%
One's a ceramic one.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.760 align:middle line:90%
One's a ceramic vase.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It looks kind of yellow
with some designs.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And so look for that.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.620 align:middle line:90%
It might be in that room.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.804 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.804 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I do
have a question.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Is she with my brother?

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Hold on.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Where else would I be?

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Where else would I be?

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:58.734 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:58.734 --> 00:46:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Who
does the skating?

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.362 align:middle line:90%
Skateboarding?

00:47:02.362 --> 00:47:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: My
brother's tried it.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Your
brother that passed over?

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Or brother-- yeah.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Because would you
have a skateboard that belonged

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.480 align:middle line:84%
to him, and some kind of
something in the garage that

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.700 align:middle line:90%
belongs to him?

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: It would be
in that storage room, too.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Now it's
in that storage room.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I would look under
the clothes, because I

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.170 align:middle line:84%
think you'll find a skating
board, a board of some kind.

00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.250 align:middle line:90%
So she's with him.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Did she have trouble
breathing at the very end?

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.248 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:22.248 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: My god.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:25.914 align:middle line:84%
I'm like-- I don't know
if I had a tube here,

00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:28.080 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like there might
have been a tracheotomy.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: No.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:29.800 align:middle line:90%
No, she didn't have any of that.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: But let me
tell you, she almost had to.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it couldn't
breathe in the end.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.700 align:middle line:90%
So there might have been--

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: She died of
lung cancer, actually.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
died of lung cancer.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Oh, geez, there's a cancer, too.

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But I know the heart,
too, is significant,

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:84%
because the change
in the heart--

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.929 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: The
heart is what was--

00:47:42.929 --> 00:47:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: It's
full, she's full.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to leave
with that, Samantha.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Please follow her.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.372 align:middle line:84%
Know that she's
one of your guides.

00:47:49.372 --> 00:47:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I think you know that anyway.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: Is she in
my house all the time?

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: She's in
your house all the time.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a
window that's stuck.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into
one of the bedrooms,

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.891 align:middle line:84%
you might find one of
the windows is stuck.

00:47:58.891 --> 00:47:59.854 align:middle line:90%
She's telling me that.

00:47:59.854 --> 00:48:00.965 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: That's my house.

00:48:00.965 --> 00:48:02.012 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
that's your house.

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: It's her house.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: OK, sit your--
hold the microphone, yeah?

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:06.630 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:07.580 align:middle line:90%
But the window's stuck.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> AUDIENCE: I have a
window that's broken.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: You have
a window that's broken?

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, she's with
you all the time

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and she's with you all
the time and please

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.657 align:middle line:90%
live her, live with her.

00:48:15.657 --> 00:48:16.240 align:middle line:90%
She wants you.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at you looking
at the stars and she said,

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I was with you when you
were looking at the stars,

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:20.520 align:middle line:90%
thinking of me.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: OK,
thank you, darling.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>> VAN PRAAGH: All right,
give me a hug goodbye.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.348 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:27.348 --> 00:48:28.514 align:middle line:90%
>> VAN PRAAGH: Thanks a lot.

00:48:28.514 --> 00:48:29.597 align:middle line:90%
Be good to yourself, yeah?

00:48:29.597 --> 00:48:32.464 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.464 --> 00:48:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you everyone,
wow, for being here.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And wow, that was an
amazing experience,

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and I know each one
of us felt that.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:40.556 align:middle line:84%
And even if you weren't
part of that family-- which

00:48:40.556 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I know the whole audience is
that family, I guess, right?

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.888 align:middle line:84%
How many members of the
that family do we have?

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:84%
One-- well, there's a
whole side over here.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:48.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's lopsided.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's really incredible,
through your experience,

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that we all could
benefit from that.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:54.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, we all felt it.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.975 align:middle line:90%
We all benefited from that.

00:48:55.975 --> 00:48:57.792 align:middle line:84%
We can visualize that
and we can really

00:48:57.792 --> 00:48:59.000 align:middle line:90%
relate that to our own lives.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for doing
that for all of us,

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and all those watching, as well.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.190 align:middle line:90%
It benefits so many people.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.964 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize the
rippling effect that we have

00:49:06.964 --> 00:49:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and that our experiences
have on other people.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.900 align:middle line:90%
So you know, that was great.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for letting
me share in that as well.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And today I just-- you know,
from your lovely grandma,

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.890 align:middle line:84%
your mom, I love getting
strong personalities.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:25.077 align:middle line:84%
And many times I always
like to learn from them

00:49:25.077 --> 00:49:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and one thing I want
to take from her,

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.285 align:middle line:84%
which I'd like to share with
everybody here, is really,

00:49:29.285 --> 00:49:32.630 align:middle line:84%
you have to live fully
in the now, yeah?

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:35.490 align:middle line:84%
As we talked about
earlier, the past is past.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.050 align:middle line:90%
It's already happened, right?

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:38.570 align:middle line:90%
The future is yet to be.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But if in your mind now
you can create your future

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:43.590 align:middle line:84%
by having these wonderful,
loving thoughts--

00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.646 align:middle line:84%
and really when we
talk about forgiveness,

00:49:45.646 --> 00:49:47.020 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take
that with you,

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.394 align:middle line:84%
take that with
you everywhere you

00:49:48.394 --> 00:49:51.560 align:middle line:84%
go because forgiving
another person

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.290 align:middle line:84%
is vital in the
evolution of your spirit.

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And you never know how
that energy of forgiveness

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.260 align:middle line:84%
will affect your life
and everybody's life

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.200 align:middle line:90%
that you touch.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So please, today,
live in forgiveness.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you all for being here.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
being a part of it.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.429 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you also
for being a part there watching

00:50:10.429 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and please watch
again next time.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Till then, I send you the
light and love of spirit.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:18.150 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
