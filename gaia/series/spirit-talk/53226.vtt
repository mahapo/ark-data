00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.076 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi everyone.

00:00:34.076 --> 00:00:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Hi, how are you?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.916 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, also,
for watching today

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
on another episode
of Spirit Talk,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:84%
where I take you one
step closer to Heaven.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So how many people
here have thought

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
about, I've loved somebody and
they've never loved me back?

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.562 align:middle line:90%
Most of us.

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.767 align:middle line:90%
Most of us had that.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
talk to you a today

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about
love and fear.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
are all spirit.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:90%
We are a source energy.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we can call
it God, we can call it spirit,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.784 align:middle line:90%
we can call it soul.

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:10.325 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want
to call it is fine,

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
label it, that's fine.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.189 align:middle line:84%
We grew up with a lot of
traditions, religions,

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.105 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, where there
were different names

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:90%
and that's fine.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But really what it
all means is source.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:90%
It's source energy.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And we are all source
energy, which is pure love.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
God is love, love this God.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And we are made of love.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And we are made of that
energy which is part of us.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
step away from love,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the more we step away from
our nature, we work in fear.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.915 align:middle line:84%
So how many people in
here love to be loved?

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it feels good, doesn't it?

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:90%
It feels really, really good.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
we love to feel love

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
is because we're in
alignment with source.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
We're in alignment with our
true nature of who we are.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Love is so incredible
because the more

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
we live with alignment of love
and we come to source energy,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
we can expand every
aspect of our lives.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And how many people
here have thought about,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
gosh, I would love to have
this condition in my house.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I would like to have a new
car, a new job, a relationship,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.092 align:middle line:90%
things that work for me.

00:02:11.092 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think they
don't work for you?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.906 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think you don't
have those things in your life?

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Fear.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fear, thank you.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So fear, what you're
doing with fear

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is you're actually
limiting your love source.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
You're limiting your power.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:90%
You're pinching away.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So you really are limiting
and pulling in with fear.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Fear really does, if
you will, constrict.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Because love is all about
expansion, expansion,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%
expansion, expansion.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And the moment
you start bringing

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
fear, which is an unnatural
energy, to who you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
are as a spirit being, then
you're really limiting source.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's really,
really interesting.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
When you bring people
into your life who

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
live for a space of
fear, you're also

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
allowing that energy to
come to and affect you,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:90%
and limiting your source.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes, oh,
I'm really upset about them.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
How could they have
done this to me?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.692 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're afraid,
and I don't understand

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:90%
why they would do this.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And how could they be some mean?

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And all these wonderful,
fearful things.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And also us.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of not having money.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm afraid of not
having a relationship.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.374 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid-- and if
you put that out there

00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that you're afraid
of that, you're

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
putting fear out
there, guess what.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what you'll have.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as source energy, as
pure loving spiritual beings,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.640 align:middle line:84%
God being God, God says yes--
constantly creating and giving

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and source always will provide.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:84%
The source provides more and
expands more, and expands more.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But if in your consciousness,
if in your mind--

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
because you create
with your thoughts,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
you're creating all the time--
if you put that out there,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:90%
that I don't have any money.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm fearful about
not having money.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't afford this.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to have
the right relationship.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they don't understand me.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I can't do this,
I can't do that.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Any time that negativity
into the equation

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:90%
you're stepping away from love.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.676 align:middle line:84%
You're stepping away
from your source.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You're stepping away
from the vortex of love,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:90%
the source of who you are.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And the more you give
power to the fear,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.310 align:middle line:84%
to the negative
energy, that's what

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:90%
you will manifest in your life.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Because the law is perfect.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
The law, the universal law,
is perfect, of manifestation.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You'll have exactly
what you want to create.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think fear,
in some ways, can

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
be used in a positive way where
it's kind of like a guidance

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to see how far away
from love you are, yeah,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:90%
how far away from love you are.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And how many people have
fearful people in their lives?

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Right, all of us.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think
you choose to have

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.148 align:middle line:90%
those people in your life?

00:04:45.148 --> 00:04:47.273 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because we're
afraid to let go of them.

00:04:47.273 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because we're
afraid to not be alone perhaps?

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's coming from a
place of fear, not being alone.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So you are setting up that
condition to live that out.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.964 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to step
into that fear, make that real,

00:05:04.964 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
you're getting
further and further

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.596 align:middle line:84%
and further away from source,
you're limiting source.

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And you will have
that condition.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So you will complete
that cycle and constantly

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
have that cycle, where you
will have people in your life,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.965 align:middle line:84%
because you're afraid not
to have anybody, guess what.

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to have anybody.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you do get
somebody into your space,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
into your atmosphere, they won't
be coming from a space of love.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
They will also be coming
from a space of fear,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:90%
because you have asked for that.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
You have asked for that by what
you sent out to the universe.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:84%
The universe will attract
that with your thoughts,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
with your energy,
with your expansion.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:90%
God says yes.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
We are all god.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Our egos, our
human part says no.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Fear says no.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Fear can be a great, great
guidance, like I said,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.736 align:middle line:84%
it can be a great,
great guidance.

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:53.597 align:middle line:84%
And fearful, I
shouldn't do that.

00:05:53.597 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't do this.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.374 align:middle line:84%
It kind of validates love,
in a way, it validates love.

00:05:58.374 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:90%
What else are you afraid of?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.179 align:middle line:90%
Give me some more examples.

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Just scream it out.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Death.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Death,
that's a good one.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So the fear of death, that's
very, very interesting.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Which I find that, when
you're in complete alignment

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:84%
with self, you
realize that there

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as death, that
death is really an illusion.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.895 align:middle line:84%
But we have believed over years
that there's such a fear about

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
it because it's the unknown
and we cannot control it.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting
because the world's

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.620 align:middle line:84%
going to go on whether
we live or not.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything's going to go on
whether we control things,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
whether there's
certain conditions.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is going to die.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And we die every day.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:90%
We die every day.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So we die every day, cells
die off, new cells regenerate.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:90%
We do that every day.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And there really should
be no fear in death

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
such thing as death.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a fear of
death, you're limiting you.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:90%
You're limiting yourself.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're putting
ourselves in a box.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of a
control type of thing.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.441 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to tell
people, you have no control.

00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:90%
You have no control.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
You have no control.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
But what you do
have is you do have

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:84%
control of how you respond
to other people's situations,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:84%
how people choose to
really work with you.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you
are in control of how

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
you're going to receive
information from somebody else,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.728 align:middle line:84%
whether you're going to
accept that information

00:07:23.728 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
into your atmosphere
of love, or not.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So I often say you
can't control others.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.984 align:middle line:84%
But you certainly can control
what you think about them,

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.150 align:middle line:84%
or how you're going deal
with a situation from them.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you're putting
out an energy of I

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:90%
don't like that person.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
There's some fear
based information,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
again you're creating fear.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you put that out
into the atmosphere,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:90%
where I'm afraid here.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of that, the
universe will give it to you.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So what are you afraid of?

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
What's your biggest fear?

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE:
Suffering at the end.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.758 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Suffering at the end.

00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And why do you think
you're going to suffer?

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.185 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've seen
people suffer at the end.

00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:00.851 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You've
seen people suffer.

00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, why have they suffered?

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:03.649 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Pain.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Pain.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.231 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cancer.

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Guess what,
God, in his wondrous way,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
has given every one of us, or
scientists, a bit of droplets.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I call it the droplets of
God, inspired scientists

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to invent certain chemicals,
certain medications, that

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.300 align:middle line:84%
guess what, we don't
need to be in pain.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.949 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to be in pain.

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We might want to because
we feel, oh, we've

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:90%
got to be in pain.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.052 align:middle line:84%
We've got to suffer
before we die

00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
death is about.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Not at all, that is an illusion.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.506 align:middle line:90%
We do not need to suffer.

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a lovely
thing called morphine.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Which guess what,
if I'm going through any pain,

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:90%
morphine, thank you.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Because God has
created that for us,

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and really given that invention
to scientists to manifest that,

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%
so we don't need to be in pain.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:90%
We do not need it.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.886 align:middle line:84%
That is not natural
to our source.

00:08:53.886 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not natural to who we
are as spiritual beings,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.441 align:middle line:90%
as soul beings.

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:90%
We really don't need it.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.467 align:middle line:84%
The actual transition of
leaving the body, when

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the spirit leaves, it's a
very natural experience.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a very lovely experience.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a very happy experience.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It's jubilant,
everyone's very joyful

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
when they pass out
of the physical.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
I've never once, in my 30
years of doing this work,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
have I ever had a
spirit come back

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and say, gosh I really
miss that disease.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
I really miss being
ill and being sick.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I just want to come
back in that body.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Not once, not once.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's because, of
course, this our school room.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:90%
This is not our home.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
This is the illusionary world.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:90%
We, as humans, work things out.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We work out our sense
of acceptance of self,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:90%
living in alignment with love.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Understanding love for loving
of self, loving of others,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and really creating
the conditions

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:90%
in our life from love.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.384 align:middle line:84%
You can have anything
in your life you want.

00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
If you work in alignment, and
you work with the atmosphere

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
correctly, if you
come from your source

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
energy of pure love,
which is who you are,

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:90%
you can have anything you want.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's unfortunate that
we sometimes live in fear.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And fear limits love.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
So you push things back.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:90%
You're pinching that energy.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
You're pinching,
you're limiting love.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we don't have
everything we always want,

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So, so many of us, we
want to be in love.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we feel like,
I don't know what it is.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.150 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about love,
James, what is love?

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:90%
What is love?

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So any time you feel
good about something,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
any time you love
something, whether you

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.850 align:middle line:84%
love a beautiful garden, whether
you love a beautiful meal,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
whether you love a
person, whether you

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
love a various
situation, a sunset,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.502 align:middle line:90%
does that make you feel good?

00:10:38.502 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's love.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:90%
That is love.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.544 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense, huh?

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
think about that.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Think about that, the
things that make you happy,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:90%
the things that are good.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Because that is what love is.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:90%
So love isn't away from us.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Love is a part of
our everyday lives.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But we've just got
to realize that love

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.482 align:middle line:90%
is a part of our everyday lives.

00:11:00.482 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
It's what we feel good about.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:90%
And what is fear?

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.497 align:middle line:90%
How can we tell fear?

00:11:06.497 --> 00:11:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Things that we don't love.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Things that we're
not happy about.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
People's negative emotions,
people that we're around

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
that are really kind of
downers, and like depressed,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.736 align:middle line:90%
and it's like, oh, my goodness.

00:11:16.736 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
If they talk one more time
about not having enough money,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.089 align:middle line:90%
or this is happening.

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
You know those people
in your lives, right?

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Those people they just complain
and they're a lot of victims,

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.450 align:middle line:84%
they have a victim
consciousness.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so worried about that.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh this--

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It becomes painful for the
person with them, listening

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:90%
to that, and very boring.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Very boring.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
After a while, you don't want
to be around negative energy.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.351 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be
around negative people

00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:90%
because they bring you down.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's because that's
not their natural energy.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.036 align:middle line:84%
So if you want your life,
if you're in your life,

00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and you want your
life to change,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
seriously, you want to bring
things that make you happy,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
that come close to your
alignment of source,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
of love, of your soul's
source, which is love.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
I often say to people,
maybe have some things

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
around your house that make you
cheerful, a tropical fish tank,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful painting.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Cook some beautiful meals.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Whatever makes you
happy, that is love.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And whatever brings you fear,
whatever brings you fear,

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
whatever you don't feel happy
about that is fear based,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:90%
say bye-bye.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't need it.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
If you want to continue with
it, you have that choice, too.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But I would think that
life on this planet

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
is very, very short.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
to use this time

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that we have here with the
most optimum way possible.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
In the most optimum
way possible.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.012 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:39.012 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
This lady, you have
a question over here.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing, please?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What is your name?

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Shannon.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Shannon.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You look
very pretty today.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very beautiful.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.753 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What's
your question, my love?

00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My question is
the fear of pain, again.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.912 align:middle line:90%
Do medications interfere--

00:12:56.912 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well let
me just go back, and let

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:90%
me just work with you on this.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you say
you're afraid of pain,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
why do you think you have pain?

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just from physical,
not so much pain, hurting pain.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:90%
But like, illness.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.699 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
there's illness?

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Why do I
think there's illness?

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let's
just think about it.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.115 align:middle line:90%
Why is there illness?

00:13:21.115 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Why do we bring illness
into our atmosphere?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Fear, of course.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fear.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's not being in proper
alignment, and acceptance

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that we are source
and we are love.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring fear, we
bring elements or particles

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:84%
into our awareness which are not
within our natural vibration,

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.135 align:middle line:90%
it'll throw us off balance.

00:13:43.135 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It'll stop the
flow from flowing.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The energy flows up
and down the spine.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
our thoughts will

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
create the atmosphere we
have, the atmosphere that's

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
manifested.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we bring in these
limitations of source,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.250 align:middle line:84%
it's going to end
up in dis-ease,

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:90%
the flowing's going to stop.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And what happens with that?

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We become stagnant and
we open ourselves up,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and all of our thoughts of
negativity, of fear, become

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:90%
realized.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:90%
And that manifests in illness.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Illness of the mind
first, because everything

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:90%
starts with a thought.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything first begins
manifesting with a thought.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And the last place
a thought ends up

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
is in the physical vibration.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
have to be very, very

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:90%
careful of our thoughts.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.481 align:middle line:90%
Think of your mind as a garden.

00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And I love them, I'm
talking about garden,

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
you're all loving
it, I can tell.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:90%
You're smiling over there.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But think of your
mind as a garden.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you want a beautiful garden?

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Cultivate a lovely landscape of
flowers that you're proud of.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Or do you want
one full of weeds,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and that nothing can grow?

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.430 align:middle line:84%
It's up to each one of us
to be in that alignment.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:90%
And that is our responsibility.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that hard.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard to do this.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
What I just said before was what
makes you happy is love-based.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.830 align:middle line:84%
What does not make you
happy is fear-based.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
live every day being

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:84%
in that alignment of
love and source, or not.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In the
physical world,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
does any disease that
requires medication,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.359 align:middle line:84%
does medication interfere
with your spirit?

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The spirit
is pure and whole.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%
It does not interfere.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
the spirit, actually.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:90%
One is a physical vibration.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.807 align:middle line:84%
One is etheric, of another whole
different world, if you will.

00:15:29.807 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I would say there are
certain medicines that

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:84%
can affect the mind, in a
way, or how you're thinking,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:90%
that could affect you.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But that affects in a
physical, your decision making.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Certainly that has an effect.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
But the spirit itself is pure.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I do believe, and you know,
I've been talking about disease,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:84%
I just want to touch
on this a little bit,

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that there are also, we have
to remember as a soul being,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that there are some souls who
tend to come back on this Earth

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
planet, in this school
room, to learn lessons.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But certain lessons that some
souls come back, they can only

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
learn those lessons if they
come back with a certain, let's

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.944 align:middle line:84%
say, disease, or malady,
physical problem.

00:16:06.944 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe if they have
a physical problem, let's

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
say it's a physical
handicap for instance.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
If they have this
physical handicap

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps they have
cerebral palsy let's say.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And maybe by having that,
by coming in that condition,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.355 align:middle line:84%
that the soul
groups have decided

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.105 align:middle line:84%
that's what they're
going to come back at.

00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
By having that condition, they
are teaching all those loved

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:84%
ones around them
about compassion,

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
giving more, assisting,
maybe forcing

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
them to look at
their own health,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
themselves better.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.954 align:middle line:84%
So there is a
reason behind that.

00:16:37.954 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.247 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're very
welcome, you're very welcome.

00:16:41.247 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'd like to do with you
at this moment, and everybody

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
home, every once in
awhile on this show

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I like to have people come
back to alignment of source.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I think that many,
many of us go through our days

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:90%
and we forget who we are.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And we don't take five minutes
just to be with ourselves.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So I want to give all
of you an opportunity

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:90%
to just be with yourselves.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
do a meditation,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
or I call it a mind journey,
a connection with self.

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you've never meditated
before, relax, do not worry,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.389 align:middle line:84%
it's just a little
guided journey

00:17:15.389 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take you on.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes if you could, just

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes
here in the studio.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And at home, close your eyes.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
You're welcome to, at
home, you can lay down.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Here we're going to
sit in the chair.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.342 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:28.342 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And being the sensitive
person that I am,

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm already feeling energy.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.432 align:middle line:84%
And when I say energy, I
like to tune into love.

00:17:39.432 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That is really when I start
turning to love in the morning.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And the more I meet people
the stronger and stronger

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:90%
it gets, which is great.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So as you hear my voice, and
the music behind it, just gently

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:90%
close your eyes.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And just for a few
moments, give yourself

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:90%
this time to be with yourself.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:90%
We worry so much about the past.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
That's all happened already,
nothing we could do about that.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
The future is yet
to be, so don't

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.890 align:middle line:84%
waste the energy
worrying about that.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.650 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do right
now is become aware of you

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:90%
at this moment.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful soul
sitting in this chair.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful soul lying
down on the floor at home,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:84%
if you're lying down
or sitting down.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful of who
you are as a soul that's

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
been through eons and
eons and eons of times.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Who has experienced
many, many Earth lives.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Many lives in other solar
systems, other planet's

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, to perfect
your awareness of self,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to perfect your awareness that
you are an expression of love.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit in
that chair, just

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
be mindful with your
thoughts of the body.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of your
feet on the floor,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
of your legs, your backs on
the chairs, your shoulders,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
your arms, your chest and
your stomach, your head.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And be aware, please, of
just how the body feels.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You might have some aches
and pains, and that's OK.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Just acknowledge them and
just let that go back,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:90%
just let it go by.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And come back to the
sound of my voice.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
It's also so lovely, I find, to
give a little bit of gratitude

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.435 align:middle line:84%
to the body, an attitude of
gratitude to the physical body.

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It got you here today.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
You are here in this
space right now,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.105 align:middle line:84%
whether you're
watching this at home,

00:19:32.105 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
or you're here in the studio,
you are meant to be here.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
There are no
accidents with source.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.340 align:middle line:84%
There are no accidents
with divine source.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
divine intervention.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit in this
space, I want you now

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of this
beautiful heart that you have.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful heart in
the center of your chest

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
is the seat of
unconditional love.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And through love, all
things are possible.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you, with your
mind, to take a little journey,

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
delving deep into your heart
as if it's a swimming pool.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Just delving in.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And see a beautiful green ray
of light in that heart center.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This center of where
the soul resides.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Anything is perfect.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.955 align:middle line:90%
Everything is beautiful.

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%
You are light.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:90%
You are that God source.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And as you go into the
swimming pool of your heart,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:31.265 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to
become aware in your mind

00:20:31.265 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
of the different images, the
different experiences, perhaps

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:84%
the people in your
life that you love.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Begin to see them, whether
in the physical world,

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%
or in the spirit world.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Just when you see their face,
how does your body react?

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:90%
How does your spirit react?

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:90%
How does it resonate within you?

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:84%
There will always
be a resonation,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:90%
people that bring you love.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.660 align:middle line:90%
See them, one face at a time.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you become aware
of that loving energy,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
for each person in turn, it
lights up your auric field

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.486 align:middle line:90%
all around you.

00:21:21.486 --> 00:21:22.890 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good, good, good.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:90%
And it brings up your energy.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Love is the fastest
vibration we have.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
So tuning into that loving
energy, those loving thoughts,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
those loving impressions
bring up your energy,

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
bring you into
alignment with source.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You feel much more
that you are yourself.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.975 align:middle line:84%
You feel much more connected
to who you truly are,

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
not what you think,
but who you truly are.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And now become mindful
of different situations

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
make you happy.

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Different experiences
that you do in your life

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:90%
that you love to do.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And just see them play out
in front of you in your mind,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:90%
as if you're right there.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I can see the
smiles on your faces

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
as you go right into that
scene that brings you love.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful of how you
feel when you see this scene,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
relive this scene
over and over again.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And now I just want
you to see the future.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to
create in this space,

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
a future scenario where you want
to see yourself in 10 years,

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:90%
with as much love as you can.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:90%
So you being God and that love.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:84%
You want to see what
brings you happiness,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:90%
what brings you pure love.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It might be something you've
never seen before, tried

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:90%
to visualize before.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
But now is your chance to
send love to the future,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:84%
to send love to the experiences
that you're going to have.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you come
from a space of love,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
pure source will
always fulfill it.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:35.974 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep
breath, and exhale.

00:23:35.974 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And now I want you to go into
your mind, and above your mind

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
there's a picture screen,
a movie screen perhaps.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to be
mindful of people in your life

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:84%
who bring you fear,
who you're afraid of.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:58.255 align:middle line:84%
And not judgment,
remember judgment is fear.

00:23:58.255 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you judge
another, you're

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
coming from a space of fear.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So you might ask yourself,
why am I judging that person?

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
What lesson are they
teaching you about love?

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So who do you
judge in your life?

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Just see the faces.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you see
them, just maybe you

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:84%
could ask, why am
I judging them?

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:90%
What is the reason?

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:84%
What is the illusion I'm
living in with each person

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.134 align:middle line:90%
that I'm seeing right now?

00:24:27.134 --> 00:24:32.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll have a
better understanding,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.670 align:middle line:84%
because you've come
from love, a better

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:90%
understanding of the situation.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Why are you holding
onto this fear?

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Why are you holding
onto this judgment?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.377 align:middle line:90%
What is it teaching you?

00:24:46.377 --> 00:24:51.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like you to
see in your minds eye

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
a scenario, a scene, of
something you're fearful of.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you bring that into the
awareness of your mind, what

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
you're afraid of,
fearful of, I want

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
you to now change
that by bringing love

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.845 align:middle line:84%
into that scenario,
and see how it changes.

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.081 align:middle line:90%
See how it changes.

00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:90%
You have the power.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
You have the power.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And bless those people,
bless those scenes.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I would like all of you
to repeat, out loud,

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:90%
these words: healthy am I.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:90%

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.331 align:middle line:90%

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.114 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.114 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Ooh!

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%

So I want you all now
in the audience here

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to look around to
somebody in the audience,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and what I want you to do is, I
would like for you to just look

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:84%
around at each other,
there you go, cool.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected,
we're all one energy,

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:90%
we're all one source.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.653 align:middle line:84%
How was that exercise
for you guys?

00:26:31.653 --> 00:26:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Opened some new ways of
looking at things, yes?

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Opened up that window?

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So I want you as you look,
look again around people,

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to
find somebody here.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to come
from a space of love.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to imagine a
green light from your heart,

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to send it
to somebody in the room.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Just send it to their heart.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Feeling tickling.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
feels really good.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:90%
You feel it?

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:90%
You feel receiving it?

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:14.650 align:middle line:90%
You feel giving it?

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in giving we
receive, it's very, very true.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, as I do that,
and the reason why

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:84%
I like to work from
love, it really

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is a natural sense of
our energy of being.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And we bring the energy
up to a higher vibration,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.323 align:middle line:84%
love being the highest
vibration there

00:27:30.323 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
is, it really gets
us closer to spirit.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world is really
in a much faster vibration,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and they come from
a space of love.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Now when they go over
to the spirit world,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
there are many times of
course, they bring with them

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:84%
the conditions of the mind
that they passed with.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And many times they're
over there, and they feel,

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
oh, I could have done so
much better on the Earth.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
But they're in a
space of acceptance,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:90%
and wholeness, and love.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:90%
They're back home.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And many times they'll
come back down here

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and they want to say they're
sorry, or I'm around you.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And many, many times.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So as a medium, I'm setting
up the energy in this space

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:90%
as well for them.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I work with the
spirit world, out of respect

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.560 align:middle line:84%
to the spirit
world, I find I need

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:90%
to bring the energy up, yes?

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
come close down, yes?

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's somebody here who
has a picture of a male figure.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a younger picture.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:24.780 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, would
you mind standing?

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.997 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And what
is your name, lovely?

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Vicky.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Vicky, first
of all, as I get a connection

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking to me,
now it's getting exciting.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Now it's getting
excited, getting excited.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to get
him more close to me.

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But Vicki, let me just say to
you that your brother's here.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.610 align:middle line:90%
It's your brother.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:44.374 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.748 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:45.748 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I want to let you
know that I'm not sure

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.030 align:middle line:84%
if that photograph has
a little bend on it.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.095 align:middle line:90%
Do you have it with you?

00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, it's
at my parents' home.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.368 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:55.368 --> 00:28:57.140 align:middle line:84%
But you know about
the crease in it.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Or there's--

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.681 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's an older,
black and white photo.

00:28:59.681 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And it with those little black
corners pasted into a photo--

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he's showing me

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:90%
there's a crease in it.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.317 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
are thinking of,

00:29:06.317 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
he's telling me you were
thinking about that photo

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.359 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:11.150 align:middle line:84%
That you were actually
thinking about that.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you
that when he comes in here,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.513 align:middle line:90%
go on, go on, go on.

00:29:16.513 --> 00:29:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, he's
around you quite a bit.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:90%
He loves you quite a bit.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I know there was
a moment, or there

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
was some time where you either
didn't speak with each other,

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.380 align:middle line:90%
or there was a separation.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know there must
have a separation

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.876 align:middle line:84%
as far as
geographically there was

00:29:30.876 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:84%
a separation from each other,
and an emotional separation

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense, please?

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He died at birth.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
oh he died at birth.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
He died at birth, so there
would be a separation.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.594 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the picture you have
is a baby picture of him?

00:29:43.594 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I see, I see.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And why is it we have
about December, by the way?

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.634 align:middle line:84%
December would mean
something, please?

00:29:50.634 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
my mother's birthday.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And has she
passed over, your mom?

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:53.895 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Or
is she still here?

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They're both alive.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.307 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:29:56.307 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Can you just tell your mother
that your brother is fine?

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:90%
That he's OK?

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:90%
And that not to worry about it.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's very much alive,
he's back in the spirit world.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:90%
So would you tell her that?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, because
when he was born dead

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:84%
at birth, her religion,
she was worried

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't baptized, and
that he wouldn't go to Heaven.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
just man made.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I know that.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I know that.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let
her know that, well,

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.366 align:middle line:84%
so you have to say
it in a way for her

00:30:22.366 --> 00:30:23.907 align:middle line:84%
that she understands
that angels come

00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:25.925 align:middle line:84%
in all different manners,
all different ways.

00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great, thank you.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And, does anyone
have a picture of a loved one?

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:90%
You do?

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
May I see that?

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.734 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:30:31.734 --> 00:30:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what is your name?

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Shannon.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Shannon.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.126 align:middle line:90%
And this is a picture of?

00:30:36.126 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That is my cousin.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
That's your cousin.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:90%
What is her first name?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Katie.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Katie.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.339 align:middle line:84%
And this person passed
as young, obviously?

00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:43.005 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:43.005 --> 00:30:44.338 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Young person here.

00:30:44.338 --> 00:30:46.445 align:middle line:84%
All right, so can
I just tell you,

00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.000 align:middle line:90%
let me just get in here, shh.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.912 align:middle line:84%
She's with a man in
the spirit world.

00:30:49.912 --> 00:30:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's a gentleman
who's passed over.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And he's older than she is.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I've
got to tell you that.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it might be
an uncle of hers,

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:84%
that it's someone
passed over before her.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to tell you that.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that would
be a relation to you as well,

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.840 align:middle line:90%
So it could be a grandfather.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Might be?

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I've
got to tell you,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.835 align:middle line:84%
with this girl I feel like with
you, I feel more like a sister?

00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.793 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and
I feel like I'm really

00:31:12.793 --> 00:31:15.211 align:middle line:84%
connected with you on a sisterly
level, more than a cousin

00:31:15.211 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
almost feel like twins.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.151 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:31:19.151 --> 00:31:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Why does she talk
about a necklace?

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, when she
passed, she had on a necklace

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:90%
that was her favorite necklace.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And so at her funeral, they
buried her with this necklace.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and was there
someone that wanted to take

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.638 align:middle line:84%
the necklace, or
thought, you know,

00:31:34.638 --> 00:31:36.205 align:middle line:84%
we should keep this
in honor of her--

00:31:36.205 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Possibly.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --instead
of burying it with her?

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Possibly.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, OK, great.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you
that with this girl,

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.456 align:middle line:84%
I feel like whether I'm
going to go back to school,

00:31:45.456 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:84%
or whether I'm going
to study, or start

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:90%
something new going on my life.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But I was just right there
going to start something new.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.907 align:middle line:84%
Was she on her way
visiting somebody?

00:31:53.907 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
She was giving me a sense
she was going somewhere.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She was
going somewhere, correct.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.766 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Where
was she going?

00:31:58.766 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She was, I
think going to a party.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A party, OK.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't there another
person involved in her death?

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Was there a car that
came, or something?

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And hit her?

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that right?

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.276 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I don't feel

00:32:12.276 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
like she was the one
who started this.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.584 align:middle line:84%
I feel it was someone that
came in her space, yes?

00:32:17.584 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I got to
tell you that with this girl,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I think, go on-- she's funny.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:90%
She has a great sense of humor.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.660 align:middle line:90%
She has a great personality.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:25.965 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:26.832 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I feel like I want

00:32:26.832 --> 00:32:29.280 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that it was
almost a sense that I

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.660 align:middle line:90%
was going to start my life.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.744 align:middle line:90%
My life was just starting.

00:32:31.744 --> 00:32:34.118 align:middle line:84%
And there was going to be new
house that she just bought,

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:36.490 align:middle line:84%
or she was getting involved
in moving to a new place.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But she's talking about
getting something started.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.634 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you saved a
book of hers, or something

00:32:41.634 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to do with some kind of a book
that she was talking about.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Actually, so when
she was little,

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:84%
she had those Richard Scarry
books, the little animated

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:51.340 align:middle line:90%
character.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So my oldest son,
who's younger than her,

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:84%
somehow I ended
up with that book.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.322 align:middle line:84%
And that was his favorite
book when he was a child.

00:33:00.322 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow, wow.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Well she knows
that you have that.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.266 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if recently
that came into your awareness

00:33:06.266 --> 00:33:08.140 align:middle line:84%
that you either did
something with that book,

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.264 align:middle line:90%
or you looked at that book.

00:33:09.264 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's
something about that.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.347 align:middle line:90%
And does she have a brother?

00:33:13.347 --> 00:33:14.165 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:14.165 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have a brother.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I'm going
to tell you something

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that this girl comes
in with the brother.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So your brother,
she talks to him,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.921 align:middle line:90%
and she's able to get there.

00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:27.170 align:middle line:90%
She's around you all the time.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, I'll
leave you with that.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.551 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:33:29.551 --> 00:33:30.095 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:33.839 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let
me work on your behalf

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.340 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit world,
and for yourself,

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.798 align:middle line:84%
and I want to tell
you that there's

00:33:38.798 --> 00:33:40.640 align:middle line:84%
a lady that comes into
my experience here.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.160 align:middle line:90%
I know she's a mother figure.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she
goes to a hospital,

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
it's almost two days
there, and she passes.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like this
lady would have--

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.920 align:middle line:84%
it was later in her life, and
I want to go in this area.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I want to go over here.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure where I am.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think I might
be in this area.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Did your mom pass, over here?

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Right there, that's
where I think I am.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.700 align:middle line:84%
You understand about
this lady, yes?

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And would you mind
standing, sweetheart?

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the lady that
I'm getting here

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.590 align:middle line:84%
is a mother figure
who passed over.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.400 align:middle line:90%
She's your mother.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:84%
She would have
been in a hospital

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.239 align:middle line:84%
about two to three days
before she passes over.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
to you, darling?

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it does.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I also
feel like she could not

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:90%
breathe before she passes over.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why I feel in
my heart area, congestive heart

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
stuff going on with
her, too, as well.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand?

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about either they

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:84%
were going to do a
procedure for her early on,

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
or they did a procedure
early on, earlier on.

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They did, yes.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
don't feel as if it

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.823 align:middle line:84%
did-- I don't know if
it was a pacemaker.

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:37.989 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there was
something with the valves.

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But that it is something
that didn't fully take,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.132 align:middle line:84%
or I feel like it
didn't work well.

00:34:42.132 --> 00:34:43.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.248 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell you that I
know this lady, when she comes

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.190 align:middle line:84%
in to me, she's been
around you quite a bit.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.152 align:middle line:84%
And do you have
a sister, at all?

00:34:52.152 --> 00:34:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did, yes.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You did.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:90%
And she's passed over?

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.484 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
she's with your sister.

00:34:56.484 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
she's with your sister.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I know that, I keep on
getting your sister being

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.380 align:middle line:84%
happy and joyful here, and when
she comes in with your mother.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And she was over there
to bring your mom over.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.411 align:middle line:84%
And she wants me to
tell you that you

00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:12.444 align:middle line:84%
asked her to come and
greet mom, and she did.

00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
and I know that you

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.980 align:middle line:84%
must have had a dream about
either your mother and sister

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:22.797 align:middle line:84%
recently, or about two weeks
ago, you understand that?

00:35:22.797 --> 00:35:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Within
the last week, yes.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Within the last
week, thank you very much.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Because she said that
she was definitely

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.450 align:middle line:90%
with you in the dream state.

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:30.840 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it was her.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you remember, she
looked young, she was happy,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to
project to you that she

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.530 align:middle line:90%
was in a space of happiness.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and she
was able to speak again,

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.937 align:middle line:84%
she was able to talk
again, and she showed you

00:35:42.937 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:84%
how beautiful it
looked where she was.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that right?

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That is right.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.621 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she said she took you

00:35:47.621 --> 00:35:49.717 align:middle line:90%
on a tour of Heaven.

00:35:49.717 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that, my love?

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.716 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and
I know that you said,

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.420 align:middle line:84%
your name is Lucy, but I've
got to go to another Lucy.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So there must be someone in the
spirit who had been a Lucy also

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:90%
over there.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Grandmother.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I have another Lucy
in the spirit world, who

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:90%
had come in and speak to you.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:07.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
your mother is singing.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So she wants let you
know she's singing.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:90%
She's singing.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if she means
symbolically she's singing,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.069 align:middle line:90%
or she always wanted to sing.

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:17.984 align:middle line:84%
But I got to tell you
she's expressing herself

00:36:17.984 --> 00:36:19.150 align:middle line:90%
that she's able to sing.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.002 align:middle line:84%
And she said it's
like spring time here.

00:36:21.002 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember the
flowers I showed you?

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
in that vision

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.484 align:middle line:84%
there were flowers
that she showed you.

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:27.330 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:90%
So I love that for you, OK.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you to take care
of your own health,

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.910 align:middle line:84%
she said, because you
worry, worry so much.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways, you
are fearful, you know?

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.527 align:middle line:84%
And you're limiting God
when you're fearful.

00:36:39.527 --> 00:36:40.360 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I got to
tell you, the one thing you

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.830 align:middle line:84%
mother has learned-- and she
missed her daughter quite

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:45.752 align:middle line:90%
a bit, your sister.

00:36:45.752 --> 00:36:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, a lot.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
missed her for years--

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.203 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --and years.

00:36:49.203 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And they've finally come
back together again, OK?

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know in a
way, in some ways--

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and your dad was over
there as well there.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So I know that
they're all together.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And your dad is a gentleman,
I got to tell you.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I figured he was a
businessman when he was alive.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.350 align:middle line:84%
A bit of a businessman,
and he gets things done.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
He wants to hold
the family together.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.537 align:middle line:90%
And that's very, very important.

00:37:11.537 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I know you did not speak with
your dad for a little bit.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.914 align:middle line:84%
Did you not speak with
your dad before he passes?

00:37:15.914 --> 00:37:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had
moved away, yes.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
had moved away.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.584 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel there
was-- he's talking

00:37:19.584 --> 00:37:22.250 align:middle line:84%
about a sense of not being
able to speak, got it.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.030 align:middle line:90%
I got you.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So I want to leave
you with mom saying

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:84%
thank you very much
for helping her.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for helping her.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.757 align:middle line:84%
And I know you
called the doctors.

00:37:29.757 --> 00:37:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I know you got the things
taken care of in the hospital.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I know you rearranged the room.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.244 align:middle line:90%
You rearranged the medications.

00:37:37.244 --> 00:37:39.160 align:middle line:84%
You had to make sure
this medication was good.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I know you went there.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Did you once go over
there with food,

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:90%
or brought something in a bag?

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.452 align:middle line:90%

you weren't allowed to do that.

00:37:48.272 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:84%

some food into my hospital bed,

snuck it in and she

loved that, she loved that.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And do you have her
little change purse?

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think I do.

some of her bags--

And she's telling
me you have them.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's a
couple of them, one is black,

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:07.850 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a white one.

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, if you'd
look in one of them

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.980 align:middle line:84%
you'll find a
little change purse.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Would you go look in that?

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to find--
I get really emotional--

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.780 align:middle line:90%
an old photograph.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like a
photograph, gosh from,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
like a little square photograph.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's
a picture of you

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:90%
when you were a little girl.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But would you go look,
and look for that?

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Go find that.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.370 align:middle line:84%

you from the family.

thanking you as well.

And she said to
me she raised you.

Do you understand that?

And she's talking
about she tried

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to make-- right-- she made you
the best woman that you are.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%

despite that family,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:90%
she says you know you're mine.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.910 align:middle line:90%
You're mine.

And she said you never--
oh, crying-- you never

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
felt you fit in to the family
that you were born into.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.230 align:middle line:90%
You understand that, honey?

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.081 align:middle line:84%
And she said that
you were always mine.

My honey, my baby,
my baby, my honey,

00:39:16.057 --> 00:39:17.890 align:middle line:84%

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:90%
she comes back with memories.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
She comes back
with these memories

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.410 align:middle line:84%
of you sitting down
at the table with her.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's either a little kitchen
table, or a dinette table,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.294 align:middle line:90%
and I'm counting coins.

And I'm also going to
tell you something.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you want
a little girl yourself.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.187 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a little girl?

00:40:52.187 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you want a little girl?

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
I need to tell you

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:84%
she's telling me--
again, I get so emotional

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:84%
here-- that you're going to
be blessed with a little girl.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:84%
That your wishes are
going to come true.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when you come
from love, anything's

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:84%
possible, just like
I said earlier.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
a beautiful little girl.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:12.940 align:middle line:90%
I see braids.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing this girl skipping.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing her skipping.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your grandma
was so careful about who

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.920 align:middle line:84%
you hung around with when you
were growing up in school.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't allow
certain people at the house.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And now
she's showing me jump rope.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, outside
in front of her house.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.559 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Jump rope.

00:41:32.559 --> 00:41:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And I want to sit
on the steps lot.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm that,
sitting on the steps a lot.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.508 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and she's
bringing you lemonade.

00:41:38.508 --> 00:41:39.258 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm hm.

00:41:39.258 --> 00:41:41.091 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She made
lemonade, didn't she?

00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:42.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, or some tea.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Some iced tea,
or tea, whatever it was,

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.170 align:middle line:90%
with lemon.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought I saw lemonade.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just give you that here.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.719 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you loved to draw

00:41:48.719 --> 00:41:50.260 align:middle line:84%
when you were a
little girl she said.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she said I wanted

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to put her through art class.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to put her through
art class, remember?

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.996 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she's
telling me about that.

00:41:56.996 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:90%
And I love that, honey.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.485 align:middle line:90%
I love that, you know?

00:41:59.485 --> 00:42:00.660 align:middle line:90%
You deserve it.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:90%
You deserve it.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.014 align:middle line:90%
You're great.

00:42:02.014 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
you're going to end up--

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:84%
she's giving me--
she said, I'm very

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.700 align:middle line:90%
proud that I taught her well.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I helped her well.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking about a white
cross, just a white cross.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple white cross, OK?

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that was
where she is, or there's

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.990 align:middle line:90%
something about that.

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But there's a simple
white cross somewhere.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.696 align:middle line:90%
Can you place that at all?

00:42:23.696 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
I have a portrait

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that I want to get tattooed,
it's a cross that I keep.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I take it everywhere I go.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.216 align:middle line:84%
It's in a frame, it's
big, but I always take it,

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:90%
no matter where I go.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.375 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And do you
think of her, associate her

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.096 align:middle line:90%
or something with that?

00:42:36.096 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I do, her name's
on there, when she died,

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:90%
when she was born.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, see,
you're great, you're great.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have either the
bed covering, the bedspread,

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:84%
or some bedding that
she's telling me about.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Either you just got
some new bedding,

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.270 align:middle line:84%
you were looking at bedding,
you changed some bedding around,

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.240 align:middle line:90%
she's telling me about.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I moved the
room around last night.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.153 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Last night, right.

00:43:00.153 --> 00:43:01.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.063 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm not going
to say you changed the sheets,

00:43:04.063 --> 00:43:05.310 align:middle line:90%
but you did.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:06.190 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And so the bedding
you have on the bed, there.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.255 align:middle line:84%
Are there flowers, or is there
a print, some kind of a print?

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, the bedspread.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She said you
were sitting there on that,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and she was with you
sitting down there.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that, sweetheart?

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.471 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I understand.

00:43:20.471 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
because just to show you,

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're never alone.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We're never alone,
that they're with us.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:28.136 align:middle line:84%
And do you have
some of her makeup?

00:43:28.136 --> 00:43:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you have some
of her lipstick?

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Or something you've kept?

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.169 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well I
kept it in a box.

00:43:35.169 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Some of her makeup.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, her lipstick.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, she
said you were looking at it.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I look in that box from time
to time, just to, you know.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well I
want to go to the desk.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.083 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to the table.

00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a desk, or table.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it might be--
I got it, thank you--

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.700 align:middle line:84%
she's showing me
the picture here.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:90%
She said I'm sorry.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.145 align:middle line:90%
She's really kind.

00:43:57.145 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:90%
She has manners.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:90%
And she's saying, oh, I'm sorry.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't send that
right, she said.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking to me about
a computer that you're on.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know you love
the different music.

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know you
could also be a DJ.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am a DJ.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.625 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You are a DJ.

00:44:11.625 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And this was
after she passed away.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very good.

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So she said, I know I'm
with her with the music.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And with the DJ.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And she has it on
the computer, you

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:84%
have all those songs
on the computer,

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're downloading,
you're making some CDs.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
call it, CDs, right?

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.805 align:middle line:84%
And she said you were
doing that very recently,

00:44:28.805 --> 00:44:29.680 align:middle line:90%
do you remember that?

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
and this weekend.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.270 align:middle line:90%
And I'm taking care of you.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Just, you got to be right with
yourself, and love yourself.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
most that matters.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And if anything, and
I'm so happy because I

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.680 align:middle line:84%
feel that this soul,
this wonderful woman,

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:84%
she really did
everything for you.

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And you accepted it.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.060 align:middle line:90%
You honor her.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to live with her.

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.925 align:middle line:90%
And never do anything below you.

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And never
have people around you

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.046 align:middle line:90%
who are fear-based.

00:44:58.046 --> 00:44:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because you are love.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.659 align:middle line:90%
And she taught you love.

00:45:00.659 --> 00:45:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:90%
God bless you, darling.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.289 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:03.289 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, wow, wow.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:13.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm touched.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I hope all of you are touched,
and the people at home

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:84%
are touched when you witness
how spirit is always around us.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're part of our lives.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.980 align:middle line:90%
They are part of our lives.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to
remember, as they often

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.660 align:middle line:84%
will tell us, to
please live in love.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Because love is your
natural vibration.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Love is your energy.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.890 align:middle line:84%
The more love you bring
within yourself and the world

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:84%
around you, that atmosphere,
the more miracles happen,

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and the more true you
