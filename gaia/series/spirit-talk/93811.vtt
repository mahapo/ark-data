>>ANNOUNCER: And
now, world renowned

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.835 align:middle line:90%
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.139 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much also.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining me here on
"Spirit Talk," where I take you

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.794 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:46.794 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:84%
In today's show, it's a
very interesting show.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I've been waiting a long
time to do this show,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
because today's show
is all about telepathy.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Hm, interesting.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Just that word, "telepathy,"
what does that mean?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember once when
I was at a conference,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.306 align:middle line:84%
and there was a sign
language person there.

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And I love having sign language
people at my conferences,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.270 align:middle line:90%
because it's such an art.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, what is
the sign for telepathy?

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And she said, it's this.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's signals.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.252 align:middle line:84%
It's signals being sent
from one to the other.

00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's really what it is.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.501 align:middle line:90%
That's what telepathy is.

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It's picking up and
receiving signals.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:90%
We do it every day.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
We do it every single day,
but we're not aware of it.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.357 align:middle line:84%
We're not conscious
of it sometimes.

00:01:27.357 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes
you'll be thinking

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of someone and the phone
rings, and it's that person.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:84%
You received their thought first
of who they are telepathically.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's all telepathic
communication,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.707 align:middle line:90%
and that's really what it is.

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So anybody in the
audience can give me

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
an example of how
you use telepathy,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.447 align:middle line:90%
or another way perhaps?

00:01:43.447 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: When you wake up
before your alarm goes off.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.863 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You wake up
before your alarm clock?

00:01:47.863 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.940 align:middle line:84%
That to me doesn't really
fit into telepathic,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.405 align:middle line:84%
because telepathic
is really when

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
you have a sender
and a receiver,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:90%
and that's usually what it is.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's
thinking about you,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
they're sending out
a signal, a thought,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
and you are picking
up that thought.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:90%
You're receiving their signal.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:90%
So anybody else?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.294 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Body language.

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Body language.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.558 align:middle line:84%
Now, how would you
say body language?

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:11.161 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: If
you're reading them,

00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're cutting you off,
you automatically close yourself

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.222 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
All right, so our young lady
over here said body language.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't necessarily
go with that.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I mean by that
is that's a physical thing.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you can read
them on a psychic level,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:90%
or you can be observant of that.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's
sitting like that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.528 align:middle line:84%
and they're closing
off the energy,

00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you can be-- you know
just by their structure

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
that they're not being
open to receiving.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit
different than telepathy.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.158 align:middle line:84%
It's usually a sending
of something, a thought,

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and receiving a thought.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So mothers do it all the
time with their babies,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
whether their
babies are in utero

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
or out in the world,
mothers and children always

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
have that kind of a connection,
a telepathic link, if you will.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Always happens.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.730 align:middle line:90%
You have an example?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I called my son
about a minute and a half

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.912 align:middle line:90%
after he was in a bad accident.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You called your
son after a minute and a half

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:90%
after he was in a bad accident.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.212 align:middle line:90%
Telepathic.

00:03:03.212 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Telepathic, that's
very, very true.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Very good, telepathic.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.235 align:middle line:84%
And that's really one of the
strongest links there is,

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:84%
it really is, between
mother or father and child,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're part
of that soul as well.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.672 align:middle line:90%
So different ways all the time.

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'll be
driving down the street,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you think of somebody.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:84%
They're sending you a
thought of themselves,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:84%
whether they're in the
incarnate, in the body,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.160 align:middle line:90%
or they're in the spirit world.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So how many people here,
with a show of your hands,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.235 align:middle line:84%
have been driving along,
and all of a sudden,

00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
you think of a
deceased relative?

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.945 align:middle line:90%
All of you.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think that they're
sitting right next to you

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
in the chair, in the
seat right next to you,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
sending, projecting

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.440 align:middle line:90%
a thought into your mind?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Because that's exactly
what they're doing.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:84%
They're sending you a thought,
and you're receiving it.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.066 align:middle line:84%
And you can receive
it because you

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:48.957 align:middle line:84%
have a connection
with that person.

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if the soul
is in the body, incarnate,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.582 align:middle line:90%
or out of the body, discarnate.

00:03:52.582 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%
They're still with you.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:90%
That love bond still continues.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:90%
They haven't gone far away.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.740 align:middle line:84%
They're still around you, in
the atmosphere around you.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world
are all around you.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.584 align:middle line:84%
Those levels of dimensions
are all around us.

00:04:02.584 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no place
like going there,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
be it heaven, or down
there, no such thing.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It's all around us.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world is all around
us, just a different vibration

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:84%
of energy, of
realms if you will.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So when I talk to spirit,
when I do my work as a medium,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I really am just receiving.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
So I'm receiving their signals.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.454 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
communicators,

00:04:23.454 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
as you're all gonna find
out by the end of the show,

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
because you're going
to be the mediums.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
But when I work with the
spirit world, what happens

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is I get myself into
a very receptive state

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to receive signals, and
that's what I'm doing.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit world
know that they're

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
in charge of sending the signal
to me, transmitting the signal,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:90%
transmitting the code.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is they have to
send that thought in such a way

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
that I, the medium, am able to
receive it in a certain way.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think of it
sometimes like a radio

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:90%
bandwidth.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have over here and over
here, this limit to this limit.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And they have to come somewhere
in between that bandwidth

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
in order for me to receive it,
because my bandwidth is just

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
this way, and they
have to come in that.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
If they send a
thought too quickly,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:90%
it'll go beyond my bandwidth.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.570 align:middle line:84%
If it's too slow, I won't
be able to pick it up.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So it really has
to-- they really

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
have to project that signal in
a certain way that I receive it.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, very interestingly, I
find that the best signals

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I receive from the
spirit world are

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are coming not
only from them, identification,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
who they are, but if that
signal is sent with love.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
When there's a
signal with emotion,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.402 align:middle line:84%
it comes through
stronger, as you'll find.

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So people that are
watching this at home,

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.719 align:middle line:84%
you can also do this with a
friend or a partner of yours,

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
if you want to work
with a little exercise.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Have fun with it.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.430 align:middle line:90%
It can be a game.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It really can.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Start it with a game.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Have some amusement.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Have some joy.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So I thought we would do
that, we'll start with that.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we get
to the exercise,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say to
you that you are a soul.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
You're a soul having a human
experience, not the other way

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.047 align:middle line:84%
And as a soul, really, what
that's made up of is your mind.

00:06:09.047 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Not the brain, because the brain
is part of the physical body,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:90%
but it's really the mind.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And the mind within it has all
of the memories, experiences

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
of this lifetime
and other lifetimes.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So when spirits come
back and communicate,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.580 align:middle line:84%
many times they will bring
through a memory that

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:84%
was created in the lifetime
that's still in their mind.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully it's in the
mind of the recipient,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and they try to get and light
up that memory of the recipient

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.307 align:middle line:84%
and try to send
that signal through.

00:06:37.307 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So there might be some of
you sitting here saying,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I just want my dead
son to come through.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Come on, come on, come
through, come through.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is you're
sending out a signal that you

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
have an-- want him to be
there, but you're also

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
blocking the energy, because
if you're sitting there going,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.765 align:middle line:84%
come to me, come to
me, you're sending out

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
a signal that will actually
block the bandwidth,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:90%
because you're not open-minded.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:90%
You're close-minded.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You're closing your
focus to one spirit.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So the odds of that
spirit coming through

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
are slim, because
you're not giving them

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:90%
space to come through.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You never thought
about that, did you?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And I teach audiences, or
inform audiences of that

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
all the time,
because they think,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
if they can just think of
them, the more they can,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:90%
the stronger it is.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just the opposite effect.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And spirits come through,
and really in our lives,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
things will come into our
lives and manifest in our lives

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
the more open we are and
letting the energy flow.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
If we have the intention,
we set out the intention,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and we just open up to receive
and let that energy flow,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:90%
you'll get it.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to control
it, you're going to block it.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So I love that expression,
let go and let God.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It really, really works.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It really, really works.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So when your soul leaves this
physical body, this vessel,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
your mind, as part of
the soul, goes over

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.521 align:middle line:84%
to the other side,
or another realm--

00:07:53.521 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and within that mind, of course,
all those memories and life

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
experiences you ever
had and all the belief

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.735 align:middle line:90%
systems you have as well.

00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%
That's in your mind.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
All the worries you have,
that's in your mind.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
All the ideas, mental
attitude, connections,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.260 align:middle line:84%
relationships-- all in your
mind, that goes with you.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop just here.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, yes?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So those people, who let's
say, are extreme religion,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.535 align:middle line:84%
When they say-- I'm just going
to pull one out of the hat

00:08:22.535 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.458 align:middle line:84%
Let's say born again-- born
again Christians, which I love.

00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that
mindset-- or my mother

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:84%
was very Catholic,
but very Catholic.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.851 align:middle line:84%
And when she passed away,
she was met by a priest,

00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
because that's what she
understood in her mind.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking about
a heaven with angels

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:90%
and all of this sort of thing.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.501 align:middle line:84%
And then she came back
to me as the medium,

00:08:43.501 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you don't believe
in this heaven the way I do,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.724 align:middle line:84%
She said, everybody
has the right

00:08:48.724 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to believe the way
they want to believe,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:84%
because heaven is different
for every single person based

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:90%
upon your thoughts.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I once did a reading
for an audience,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and a girl's father
came through.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.035 align:middle line:84%
I was actually communicating
with the girl's grandmother.

00:09:02.035 --> 00:09:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that the
father, the deceased father

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.880 align:middle line:84%
was over there,
standing right there.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was standing there
like this, arms folded.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.827 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him
telepathically, I said,

00:09:11.827 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
do you want to speak
to your daughter?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, why the hell
would I want to do that?

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe in
this when I was alive.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.009 align:middle line:90%
Why would I believe in it now?

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important--
it just behooves you.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It really, really behooves you.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:90%
But they do get like that.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.002 align:middle line:90%
It's a mindset.

00:09:35.002 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:90%
It really is a mindset.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And all the worry, and all the
limitation of consciousness,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.520 align:middle line:84%
the limitation of
thinking, really

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.400 align:middle line:84%
gets in the way of our
natural state of being,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.440 align:middle line:90%
our natural state of love.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Our natural state is love.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And the further you get away
from that state of love,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
the further you're away
from your true self,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and you'll never be
happy, because love

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:90%
is your natural vibration.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
If you live in fear, you're
really living from the ego,

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
which is of course
false-- F-E-A-R,

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.395 align:middle line:90%
False Ego Appearing Real.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we love that one.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and E-G-O, Edging God Out.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, it's another good one.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you can live
every day in the moment

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and clear up the mind and
really bring love as fertilizer.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I would say acts
of kindness really

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:90%
are fertilizer for the mind.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:90%
I really do believe that.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that if we can
maybe take a time every morning

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
to clear the mind, to clear
the junk out of our mind,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
it's really, really
important because then we

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:90%
can receive easier.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We can receive those
signals much easier.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So, often the spirit people will
say, you have to weed the mind.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to weed the
garden of the mind,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we have in
that mind old belief systems.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we carry other
people's expectations,

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
what other people think of us,
what their idea of who we are,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:90%
instead of who we truly are.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
All these concepts and
notions we have in this mind.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:90%
And it gets cluttered.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It gets cluttered.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, if we don't
take the time to weed it out,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that stuff's gonna
grow, and it'll

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:90%
influence our decision making.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It'll influence our
choices in life.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes then you'll become
tired, listless, emotional

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
upsets, and you'll feel
like, I'm not myself.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And you're not yourself.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Your worries, the mental
conditions of your mind

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:90%
has really taken over.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's important you
don't get like that.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.004 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do a
little meditation for you

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to help to clear out
the garden of the mind,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
to weed the garden of
the mind, all right?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.825 align:middle line:90%
And you can use this every day.

00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to do a
little meditation with you now,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:90%
it's just really a focus.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And you come into
this room here,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and those who are watching on
your computers or television

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
sets, really you
come with-- you come

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
to this moment with
a certain belief

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
system, a certain
awareness, if you will.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time now
where this is for you.

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.179 align:middle line:84%
We worry so much about other
people and our influence

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:03.845 align:middle line:90%
on other people.

00:12:03.845 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:90%
We worry about the past.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:84%
The past has already happened,
not much we can do about that.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the future is
yet to be, so there's

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
really not much you
can do about that.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you can just
live in this moment

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:84%
now, be very present
in this moment,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.542 align:middle line:90%
that you can have control over.

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, living in the
moment, present moment,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you won't be in fear, because
fear is from the past,

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:90%
not in the present.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So together, let's all
just close our eyes.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And let's just go
on a little journey.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And those at home, just listen
to the sound of my voice

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
and the music behind it.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you to do is
to really place your awareness

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
or your mindfulness just
on the physical body.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if you could
just use your imagination,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:84%
use your imagination, and
create in your mind's eye

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:90%
a flashlight, just a flashlight.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And take that
flashlight, and let

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
it shine the inside
of your body.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So illuminate the inside of
the body, the top of your head

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
bottom of your toes.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And illuminate every cell,
every muscle, every organ,

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and make sure they're all
working, in good working order.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Now this flashlight
also has the power

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to dissolve any energies in
that space, any energies that

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
are around you that
do not belong there,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.595 align:middle line:84%
any energies that are holding
you back from your potential.

00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.510 align:middle line:90%
So just be mindful of that.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you scan
your head area, be

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:84%
mindful of anyone's energy in
your space around the head,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
worry from somebody
else, other people's

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:90%
energy holding onto you.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's now time, as that
flashlight shows you, comes

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:84%
into focus, you may see
other people's faces,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
you may see dense
energies, however it's

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
going to manifest as you
see this, in your own mind,

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.015 align:middle line:90%
all around you.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
You're going to release
and dissolve that energy.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.017 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, the energy
just goes-- just breaks up,

00:14:19.017 --> 00:14:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and those particles go
all through the body,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
down out of your toes
or out of your hands.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And let Mother Earth, who's a
wonderful magnet, who's really

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.750 align:middle line:84%
our mother-- she takes
away those dense energies,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:84%
those particles that don't
belong to you to give you

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:90%
freedom of space in your mind.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.454 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.454 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
judgment with this.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just an assessment to see
what you've been holding on to.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
As you use that flashlight
and go down the entire body

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and the auric field around
you, just let it show you,

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
present to you whose energy
you've been holding on to,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
whose energy you've
been giving power to,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
whose life you're
living if not your own.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And just let them then dissolve.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
take a deep, deep breath

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
to bring in more of that
beautiful flashlight light,

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:90%
that luminosity.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you exhale,
we're going to release

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.310 align:middle line:90%
that stagnant energy.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So together, let's inhale
this beautiful light.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And holding it,
two, three, four.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Let it illuminate.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And now release and exhale.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Release, let it go,
let it go, let it go.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And another time.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Bring that beautiful luminosity.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:90%
See how warm that is.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:90%
And hold it, two, three, four.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And let it go, let
it go, let it go.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Wow, look at that, releasing all
those people from your space.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
One more time, bringing yourself
to that perfect golden light.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And holding it,
two, three, four.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.057 align:middle line:90%
And exhale and release.

00:16:10.057 --> 00:16:10.557 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:10.557 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And just sit with
that space for a bit.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful now
that you are indeed

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:90%
a soul, a light on this planet.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And become mindful
of your heart space,

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
the seat of the soul, the
space for healing and balance,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
connection to source,
the oneness of all.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And feel the love of yourself.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:84%
We were not thrown down on
this planet arbitrarily.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:90%
You have a purpose.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Every single person in this
room, every single person

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
watching this, you
have a purpose.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.150 align:middle line:84%
You are like the
stars in the sky.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You illuminate that
space that you take up.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful
of that beautiful love

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:90%
in the center of your heart.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And many times, we see
that as a green light,

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful green, loving,
compassionate light.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
That is the light
that people will see.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
That is the light
you want them to see.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is the light you
want them to share with you.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Love by its very nature is not
to keep but indeed to share.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So please, with your
intention and your thought,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
send that green light of love to
the person on your right side.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And those at home, to those
people in your life you

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
need-- that need to
receive your love.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And soon the entire
room and your space,

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
your mind, your auric field,
is open to that loving energy.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.295 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath
with that energy.

00:17:41.295 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:90%
And hold it, two, three, four.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.865 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:17:44.865 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And just stay in that
beautiful, loving space.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.594 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
open up our eyes.

00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We're getting back into the
body with a deep, deep breath,

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.376 align:middle line:90%
coming back into the body.

00:17:57.376 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:90%
And inhale, two, three.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes, put up
your arms or your fingers,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:90%
come back into the space.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting,
but when you

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
do that exercise, a
lot of times stuff

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
comes up to the surface which
you never thought was there.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody have
that experience?

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Stuff you're holding on
to-- and unconsciously.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not even
aware consciously

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.068 align:middle line:90%
that you're holding on to it.

00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It's unconscious.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
that happened

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
when you were 7 years
old or 10 years old.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.274 align:middle line:84%
It might be something someone
said to you as a child

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
or someone said to
you early on in life.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It might be one of
your family members,

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:84%
it might be a friend, it might
be a situation or scenario that

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
happened in your life, so
it's really interesting.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.415 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
do an exercise now,

00:18:38.415 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's a really
great exercise.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I save this for
my classes, and I

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
thought I'd save it
for our show today.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.529 align:middle line:84%
And it's really-- I'll call
it a telepathic exercise.

00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do it in partners,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.627 align:middle line:84%
so you're going
to have a partner.

00:18:49.627 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
the chairs around,

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.029 align:middle line:84%
so you're actually
facing a person.

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And maybe if we keep
this aisle open,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that would be great so
I'll walk around and assess

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing and help you.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And that would be great.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the people that are
watching this at home,

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
you can do this with a
friend or a partner as well.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll set up the chairs,
and we'll get back to you, OK?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.982 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here we are.

00:19:14.982 --> 00:19:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So today we're going to do
some telepathic exercises.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And I love this.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.294 align:middle line:90%
This is really, really fun.

00:19:19.294 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want you to
be very nervous at all.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.043 align:middle line:90%
I should be nervous.

00:19:22.043 --> 00:19:23.570 align:middle line:90%
No, don't be nervous.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So everybody in this
world is connected as one.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at that
person across from you,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
actually you're very
similar than dissimilar,

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
because every single person
has what's called a heart.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.670 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to be
mindful of that person's heart.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like
you to do right now

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is to be aware that
there's a beautiful current

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:90%
of green light of love.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
empathetic connection.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.562 align:middle line:84%
So this ray love,
green love, connects

00:19:52.562 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
with you and that
person across from you.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So try that, and just
see what that feels like.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.306 align:middle line:90%
Oh, isn't that nice?

00:20:00.306 --> 00:20:02.082 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:20:02.082 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, when you
love another person, that's

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:90%
what you feel.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.847 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:20:07.847 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
See, now that will open
you up a little bit.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.554 align:middle line:90%
You won't be nervous.

00:20:10.554 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a person that you feel
is a sense of familiarity.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
So as you feel that energy with
the person across from you,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
just try to feel or sense a
familiarity, something that--

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
about them that is
the same with you.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
There's some aspect to them
that you can relate to.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.330 align:middle line:84%

taking and for the receiving.

up the mind to get it.

Perfect.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you like that?

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you all feel something?

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.926 align:middle line:84%
OK, you don't want to
leave that space either.

00:20:45.926 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's just an
awareness that that exists.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%

and who's going
to be the sender.

who's going to be the

And senders, I want you to
imagine, right in front of you,

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
right in front of
your mind's eye,

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I want you to create a color.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, the color I
want you to create,

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a choice--
either red, white, or blue.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to send into
the mind of your partner

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:90%
that color you choose.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%

can, red, white, or blue.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:90%

We'll try it again.

00:22:38.585 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, OK, now the next
one, we're going to do this.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So I want the senders
to close your eyes,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
receivers get into your
neutral space, just receiving.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.910 align:middle line:84%

your head, your mind.

Just think of it as a
mind, a window there.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, senders, I want you
to send into the space

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
above your receiver a
shape, and the shape

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a circle,
a square, or a triangle.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Send a circle, a
square, or a triangle.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So pick it out now, which
one you're going to send.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.647 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to put
color on that, that's good.

00:23:11.647 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
You can make it any
characteristic you

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.350 align:middle line:84%
like-- anything that you
can get telepathically

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
sending that shape that you
choose to your receiver.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.380 align:middle line:84%
If it has an emotional charge
behind it, that's great.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:84%
If I really love a
circle, that's great.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So try to build up that
shape as much as you can.

And now project it.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Send it right to the head,
right above their head

of your receiver.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:90%

00:26:37.706 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How'd you do?

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: On the first
ones, we did right on.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.640 align:middle line:90%
On this one--

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A little harder?

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:90%
A little more complicated?

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Did you get any pieces
or aspects of this scene?

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I got some darker
feeling but it was grass that

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.700 align:middle line:90%
she was--

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Grass.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Did you send
anything with grass?

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A horse
and in a field.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:55.665 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A
horse in a field.

00:26:55.665 --> 00:26:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So the field, you
got the grass field.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.847 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You did say desert,
so maybe you saw the sky.

00:26:59.847 --> 00:27:01.222 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
more you do it,

00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
the better you'll
get at it, too,

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
just learning to
receive and open up,

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.606 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to
be very vulnerable, too.

00:27:05.606 --> 00:27:08.381 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:08.381 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How'd
you guys do over here?

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.837 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.837 --> 00:27:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 0 for 3.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 0 for 3.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Being open is really
what it's about.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.617 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do?

00:27:20.617 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We did closer.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:90%
We got water.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:84%
She was sending a
waterfall, and I

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.165 align:middle line:84%
was seeing, like, a
tropical island with, you

00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:27.334 align:middle line:90%
know, in the day--

00:27:27.334 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, very good.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.274 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: So it was close.

00:27:29.274 --> 00:27:29.661 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Close.

00:27:29.661 --> 00:27:30.161 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:30.161 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
You got an aspect of
it, which is nice.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.039 align:middle line:84%
The more you do it, the
better you get at it.

00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's being
vulnerable, it's being

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
open to receiving whatever
you're going to receive.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.949 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes not about you but
just what the information is.

00:27:40.949 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, got it.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:90%
How'd you guys do?

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Closer.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
we did better, yeah.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Got the
serenity, the feeling.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when you surrender,
it can come in perfectly.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.634 align:middle line:84%
And then your stuff doesn't
get in the way and color it.

00:27:51.634 --> 00:27:52.758 align:middle line:90%
That's a really hard thing.

00:27:52.758 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.316 align:middle line:84%
You see how much better it
is when you don't color it.

00:27:56.316 --> 00:27:56.816 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:56.816 --> 00:27:57.357 align:middle line:90%
Practice now.

00:27:57.357 --> 00:27:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:90%
How did you guys do down here?

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We did well.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.505 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We're
getting better.

00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:90%
We're improving.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.815 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the first one,
we were like this,

00:28:05.815 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly we've
become more and more clear.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.764 align:middle line:84%
And this last one, she
said, OK-- she got,

00:28:09.764 --> 00:28:11.180 align:middle line:84%
like, half of it,
which was great.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're really
picking up, yeah.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:90%
We're getting connected.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:14.769 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:14.769 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, folks.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.029 align:middle line:84%
Give yourselves a
round of applause.

00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:22.168 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:22.168 --> 00:28:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.760 align:middle line:90%
So the number one thing is this.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
In telepathy or
telepathic communication,

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
it really is when
you are the receiver,

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:90%
you have to surrender.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Surrender your mind
and just be open.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's not about you.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:90%
You've got to step aside.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.645 align:middle line:90%
So it's very much that way.

00:28:40.645 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We were over here
talking a little bit,

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and this young lady said,
we're both control freaks.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's hard when you try
to control something now,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
tell you something

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I tell a lot of my
control freaks, which

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.386 align:middle line:90%
is you have no control.

00:28:55.386 --> 00:28:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh!

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:58.582 align:middle line:90%
You have no control.

00:28:58.582 --> 00:29:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you get to that
realization that you have no

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
control, you can't
control someone else,

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:84%
you can't control someone's--
their life, you cannot do that.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But what you can
control is how you

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:90%
respond to it, how you react.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And it goes-- I talk about
this all the time on the show.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Karma, to me, is how people
treat you is their karma.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.697 align:middle line:90%
How you respond is your karma.

00:29:18.697 --> 00:29:20.155 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
use that energy,

00:29:20.155 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's really,
really important.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So this was a different
way here, now,

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:84%
of transmission,
telepathic communication.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit people when
they come through also

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
use telepathy, telepathic
images, feelings,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
shapes, colors to get
through a message.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that now, shall we?

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.790 align:middle line:90%
Please face each other.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, now what I want you to
do, we'll take turns here.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.668 align:middle line:84%
And one is going to be a
medium, and the other person

00:29:48.668 --> 00:29:49.876 align:middle line:90%
is going to be the recipient.

00:29:49.876 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The recipient, you're going
to receive the information

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.150 align:middle line:90%
from the spirit.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.315 align:middle line:84%
So decide who's going to
go first as the medium

00:29:56.315 --> 00:29:57.815 align:middle line:84%
and who's going to
be the recipient.

00:29:57.815 --> 00:30:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:90%
And you're just like a radio.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.521 align:middle line:84%
That's all-- OK, that's all
you are is a radio, folks.

00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:90%
That's all you are is a radio.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:13.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, now here are
your instructions.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So, the medium who's
receiving, you're the receiver,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:90%
you're the radio.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to just
be in that mindset.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And the receiver is going
to tell you verbally now,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:84%
they're going to speak to
you and actually tell you

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.590 align:middle line:84%
the name of the person
they want to contact

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.355 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship
of that person.

00:30:37.355 --> 00:30:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, they
might say to you,

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I want to contact my
father who's John.

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:84%
His name is John,
and that's my father.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So go right ahead, right
now, and tell your medium

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.732 align:middle line:90%
who you want to contact.

00:30:47.732 --> 00:30:51.190 align:middle line:90%
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.107 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.107 --> 00:30:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now just by
you having that thought,

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:84%
they're around you, because
you wouldn't have thought

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.093 align:middle line:84%
about them if they
weren't around you.

00:30:59.093 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And now I just want you to
concentrate with your mind.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, because that person,
your partner there,

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.772 align:middle line:84%
said the name of
the person, they

00:31:11.772 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:84%
are already behind you,
because they've already

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:90%
thought about them.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So just listen carefully,
and let that spirit drop

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:84%
into your mind
something, something--

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.360 align:middle line:84%
a thought, a feeling,
something that person

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
might know about them,
whatever it might be.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And also, as they drop that
thought, feel their love.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously love
there because the person

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:90%
asked for them.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.250 align:middle line:90%
So feel the love.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.390 align:middle line:84%
When they drop into your
mind telepathically,

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.290 align:middle line:90%
they're sending you a signal.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
They send it with love.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they want to say,
just give them that room

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.707 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, the
space to do that.

00:31:51.707 --> 00:31:52.661 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:31:52.661 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:90%


00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.807 align:middle line:90%
OK, and stop.

00:32:01.807 --> 00:32:03.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, mediums, please
share with your partners

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.098 align:middle line:84%
what you received
from the spirit.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Got it?

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.280 align:middle line:90%
You were the medium?

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:40.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good girl.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.248 align:middle line:90%
I'm very proud of you.

00:32:42.248 --> 00:32:43.164 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:43.164 --> 00:32:43.663 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:32:43.663 --> 00:32:45.399 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:32:45.399 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I knew you were an artist, see?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.299 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So that art-- you know,
when I said to you,

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:84%
you were an artist before,
when you do mediumship,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:90%
it's a creative energy.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So just whether it manifests
as art or manifests

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.715 align:middle line:84%
as communication, or it's
just creative energy.

00:32:58.715 --> 00:33:00.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just how you
use that energy.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:90%
So you'd make a great medium.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And an
artist and everything else.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.900 align:middle line:84%

set your mind to.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, kids.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do?

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.181 align:middle line:90%
Over here, did you do well?

00:33:15.181 --> 00:33:15.930 align:middle line:90%
How many did well?

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Very good, very good.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.322 align:middle line:84%
And over here, you
got something, yes?

00:33:22.322 --> 00:33:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with
us what you got?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Tell everybody.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.738 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:24.738 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I saw a little girl,
like, bouncing on a man's lap,

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:90%
like, laughing, having fun.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
got the name Kathy.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.634 align:middle line:84%
And then she said that
that's her mom's name.

>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, wow.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:35.560 align:middle line:90%
And mom's passed over?

>>AUDIENCE: No, mom's here.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%

>>VAN PRAAGH: Mom's there.

00:33:38.213 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Kathy.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Who was the person
you wanted to contact?

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Grandpa.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Grandpa.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And were you able to get
grandpa through at all?

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Would that be your dad.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:45.799 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:46.589 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:33:46.589 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:84%
He's right between you
both, you know that.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.350 align:middle line:84%
He worked with his hands
a lot, your father.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.520 align:middle line:90%
He's a hard-working man.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.535 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And I saw overalls.

00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Overalls.

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anything
about overalls?

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.726 align:middle line:90%
She got overalls.

00:33:55.726 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You mean,
like, coveralls?

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Coveralls?

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.150 align:middle line:90%
You know like that?

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, let me just help out.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:10%
Can I jump in with that?

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.270 align:middle line:10%
Because I see him.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And did he know anyone
named Jack, by the way?

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Jack or John?

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.697 align:middle line:90%
John, Jack?

00:34:09.697 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I had an uncle Jack.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was he
related to him in some way?

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Did he know of
him in the family?

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was
on my mother's side.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mother's side,
but they're over there together.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:90%
They know each other, OK?

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:84%
And there's a Mary or a Margaret
or married lady over there

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:20.090 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mary was his wife.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mary was his wife.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's who he's with.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Kathy.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kathy.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:26.174 align:middle line:90%
OK, Kathy.

00:34:26.174 --> 00:34:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Kathy-- Kathy, that's right.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Kathy, I know that
your father wants

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.549 align:middle line:90%
to-- is your mother still alive?

00:34:31.549 --> 00:34:32.174 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:32.174 --> 00:34:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Uh-huh.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Because she is right around you.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Over here, but she's
like, [COUGHING].

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:38.820 align:middle line:90%
She can't speak really well.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:90%
She's like, [COUGHING].

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
with her lungs,

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and she just can't
let it come out.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So as she comes close to me, and
you've set up the energy-- so,

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.897 align:middle line:90%
And that's your mom?

00:34:48.897 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her mom.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's your mom.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I love this whole
triangle thing.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:90%
I just love the shape.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.031 align:middle line:84%
I know-- we'll give mom a little
bit of time to come through.

00:34:57.031 --> 00:34:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But I know your father's
very proud of you

00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.871 align:middle line:90%
and what you've done.

00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel that you're more-- you
must have some siblings, then.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, are
there two other siblings?

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Two.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.043 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:35:06.043 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So I know that your father's
really, really proud.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to be the
voice box for your mother

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.410 align:middle line:84%
also to come through
here, because he

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.340 align:middle line:90%
helped her his whole life.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:84%
He pulled her up and helped
her through everything,

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:90%
understand that?

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
your dad would not

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.850 align:middle line:84%
be a man who would not be
afraid to roll up his sleeves

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.380 align:middle line:90%
and get things done.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:90%
He's a doer.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.200 align:middle line:90%
He's a doer.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:22.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a sitter.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm a doer, he says.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.110 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I know about the
brown paper bag,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to go back in time.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So you'd know something to do
with him with a brown paper

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:30.750 align:middle line:90%
bag.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.583 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's a
grocery or something.

00:35:32.583 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I have brown paper bags.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.132 align:middle line:90%
And who's Frank, please?

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: His father.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thanks.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So he's with Frank, his
father, who's with him.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a
little grocery store.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.025 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a little store
place, and you know about that,

00:35:43.025 --> 00:35:43.525 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:35:43.525 --> 00:35:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.238 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
as he comes to me,

00:35:45.238 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:84%
he goes very, very clearly to
that situation, where he said,

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I live in that-- you
would call it the past,

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.410 align:middle line:90%
but to me it just is.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.440 align:middle line:90%
So it just is.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's a lot
of women here too in the family,

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.810 align:middle line:84%
like a Fanny, a
Betty, something--

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:02.891 align:middle line:84%
these names are
coming in quickly, OK?

00:36:02.891 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They're all trying to
help your mother out

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.389 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of her
family was over there

00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:08.527 align:middle line:90%
already before she passed over.

00:36:08.527 --> 00:36:10.110 align:middle line:10%
I know about the
overall things, and I

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:10%
like that, because I
like-- and I'll say,

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:10%
he starts when he's 12.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:16.777 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:18.485 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He worked
hard at everything.

00:36:18.485 --> 00:36:19.400 align:middle line:90%
He excelled at everything.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
I don't like that.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't like everything.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:90%
That's too general.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I like 12 years of age, you have
to step up and do something,

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.592 align:middle line:84%
or step out of the family
and really do something.

00:36:27.592 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if he had the
brown paper bags he worked with,

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.070 align:middle line:10%
or papers, newspapers
or something.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think at 12 years
of age, he must have.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.382 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:35.382 --> 00:36:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Probably
a paper route.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
I know rubber bands now.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm seeing rubber bands.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.915 align:middle line:84%
Every morning at 5:30, up with
these rubber bands and papers.

00:36:40.915 --> 00:36:41.880 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:10%
And he's putting the rubber
bands around the papers.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:44.249 align:middle line:10%
That's what he's doing.

00:36:44.249 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know brown paper
bags are very significant.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I know that because they
keep on coming in here.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Your dad is a man who likes to
get things right, not wrong.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
got to be right.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.133 align:middle line:90%
You honored him for his passing.

00:36:53.133 --> 00:36:54.260 align:middle line:90%
You honored him.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.107 align:middle line:90%
You helped him over.

00:36:55.107 --> 00:36:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And I need to let you know that.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.314 align:middle line:84%
I need to validate that
with you, acknowledge

00:36:58.314 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:90%
that you helped him over.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
really felt everything

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.090 align:middle line:84%
is very precious
with your father.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.836 align:middle line:84%
I know you wanted to
carry out his last wish.

00:37:06.836 --> 00:37:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's the
way we want to say it.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You want to carry
out his last wish,

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.750 align:middle line:84%
because he's acknowledging
that and thanking you

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:90%
for doing that.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:17.139 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who had to
be taken off life support.

00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Who had to be taken
off life support?

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Was that mom?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.488 align:middle line:84%
Was there a decision
that had to be made?

00:37:22.488 --> 00:37:23.613 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: With mom, yeah.

00:37:23.613 --> 00:37:24.738 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:37:24.738 --> 00:37:25.416 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:25.915 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Come on in, sweetheart.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me just bring her in.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.920 align:middle line:84%
She's just-- she
must've lost some weight

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and really lost herself
before she passes over.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I gotta tell you, she
tells me, I'll give it a try.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.327 align:middle line:84%
Now, what are these
spirits doing?

00:37:38.327 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what you guys did.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.540 align:middle line:90%
They're sending me thoughts.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.210 align:middle line:84%
They're sending me
thought with emotion.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me, of course, it's
easier because it's a child,

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.245 align:middle line:84%
it's a parent, there's
that connection,

00:37:46.245 --> 00:37:47.380 align:middle line:90%
that love that never dies.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.327 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell
you-- and who's Joan?

00:37:49.327 --> 00:37:50.660 align:middle line:90%
She's talking about seeing Joan.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
a friend named Joan.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.293 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Joan,
she's seeing Joan.

00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:54.834 align:middle line:90%
Have you been around Joan?

00:37:54.834 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We've
spoken a lot recently.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
Joan need a healing?

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
Joan lose somebody

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.270 align:middle line:90%
in her family or something?

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:90%
A mother, a father?

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Someone is lost.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In September.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.181 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I've been with
Joan's parents over here,

00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:90%
and she's helping.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Would you let her
know that, please?

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:09.515 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you also remind her

00:38:09.515 --> 00:38:11.290 align:middle line:90%
that she just changed her phone.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.680 align:middle line:90%
She changed her cell phone.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:84%
She changed her cell phone,
her cell phone number,

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.440 align:middle line:90%
you're aware of that, please?

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.435 align:middle line:90%
Your mother's telling me that.

00:38:17.435 --> 00:38:18.716 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that something?

00:38:18.716 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that something?

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.131 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.415 align:middle line:84%
I like your dad wearing a little
pin here, some kind of a pin.

00:38:24.415 --> 00:38:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what that means,

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle line:84%
but you'd understand
about that pin.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's very proud of the pin.

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:31.581 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you buried
him with his pin on him,

00:38:31.581 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:84%
but he's very proud of
the way you did things.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.051 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
a wake, or there

00:38:35.051 --> 00:38:37.385 align:middle line:84%
must've been a funeral of
some kind for your dad?

00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to be amazed
by the amount of people

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that are there,
and he was shocked.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.164 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, I didn't
know I knew that many people.

00:38:46.164 --> 00:38:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know there would
have been-- when you're

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:84%
signing those books,
you're signing them,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.340 align:middle line:90%
there would have been two books.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
He said we filled two
books, is that right?

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because this
is what he's going on about,

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:55.840 align:middle line:90%
we filled two books.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I really like
that with this man.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I like him.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say he's cheap.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't say that.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I would say he's thrifty.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I would say he's thrifty
is what I would say.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I would say he's thrifty.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.912 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there must
be some boxes of his things

00:39:09.912 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:90%
still around somewhere.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.535 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my.

00:39:11.535 --> 00:39:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.755 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, my.

00:39:12.755 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he gives
me-- and your mother's

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.276 align:middle line:84%
coming right here,
smiling her head off.

00:39:16.276 --> 00:39:18.350 align:middle line:84%
She said, thank you
for this opportunity.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:19.370 align:middle line:90%
She's really sweet.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for this opportunity.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.390 align:middle line:84%
She's very nice and
mannerly, and very

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.620 align:middle line:90%
sweet and appreciative.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your father--
you'd have boxes of your dad

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.770 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.061 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's in a
garage or it's in a basement,

00:39:30.061 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
but there's someplace
with his things.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.515 align:middle line:10%
I know if you go
and look around,

00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:37.875 align:middle line:10%
you'll find those brown
paper bags, damn it.

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Did he know Ed?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Was there an Edward
or Ed that he knew?

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Edmund or Ed?

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.419 align:middle line:90%
The name Eddie or Ed?

00:39:44.419 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His
father had a brother.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.918 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Named Ed.

00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an Ed
over there as well.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know--
you have a boy as well?

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.475 align:middle line:90%
You have a boy?

00:39:51.475 --> 00:39:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.146 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I know that
there's-- in your mind here,

00:39:54.146 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:90%
there's worry about your son.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And your mother
is coming in here.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.400 align:middle line:90%
She says, can I just talk?

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can speak.

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:84%
She says, thank you for
helping me in the hospital.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for taking care
of me in the hospital.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.166 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for really
taking care of her,

00:40:05.166 --> 00:40:07.016 align:middle line:84%
washing her, making
sure she was clean.

00:40:07.016 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you knew that
you had to do it,

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:84%
because those nurses
wouldn't do it.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
your mother knew

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.690 align:middle line:84%
every single thing
you were doing.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.025 align:middle line:84%
You even took her hands,
and you held them in yours.

00:40:16.025 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.483 align:middle line:84%
Toward the end, you
were holding that.

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:21.067 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there must've
been something with oxygen

00:40:21.067 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:84%
or something with your
mother, at one point.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.551 align:middle line:84%
And I know you said to yourself,
it's not doing any good.

00:40:25.551 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not doing any good.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about 2
o'clock in the morning,

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.440 align:middle line:84%
because there seems to be some
kind of a change at 2 o'clock

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.500 align:middle line:90%
in the morning, she said.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.250 align:middle line:90%
2 o'clock in the morning.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I heard
a train at that time.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: At 2 o'clock?

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, because that's very
significant to your mom.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:39.112 align:middle line:84%
Your mom was very, very
aware of things going on.

00:40:39.112 --> 00:40:39.945 align:middle line:90%
She was ready to go.

00:40:39.945 --> 00:40:41.580 align:middle line:90%
She saw your dad right away.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.455 align:middle line:84%
They had a card game
all ready for her.

00:40:45.455 --> 00:40:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I hope that makes sense
to you, but she said,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.871 align:middle line:84%
there's a card game
all ready for me.

00:40:48.871 --> 00:40:51.060 align:middle line:10%
And it was as if there's
a table there with cards,

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:53.122 align:middle line:10%
and she has to sit in her spot.

00:40:53.122 --> 00:40:54.282 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that funny?

00:40:54.282 --> 00:40:55.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that means.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.989 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And your mom is very
happy over here.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:00.567 align:middle line:90%
You must have her necklace.

00:41:00.567 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I do
have a necklace, yes.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, she said
you have her necklace.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.436 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you wear it?

00:41:04.436 --> 00:41:06.979 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.979 --> 00:41:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I worked
very hard to get that.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
My sister-in-law wound up
with it after she passed.

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.804 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:41:11.804 --> 00:41:14.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of fighting, a lot
of in-family fighting

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.860 align:middle line:90%
and feuds and all that?

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.823 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mother
doesn't care about that.

00:41:19.823 --> 00:41:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the hell with her.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.128 align:middle line:84%
Now she's turning from this
really nice lady to this,

00:41:23.128 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
like-- but it's almost
like, to hell with her.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.500 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.708 align:middle line:84%
You've got to love her for
everything, warts and all,

00:41:29.708 --> 00:41:31.950 align:middle line:84%
because that's all that she
knows, the sister-in-law.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's money.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she has insecurity
about abundance.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.810 align:middle line:90%
That's probably what it's about.

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can be better
than-- but she

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.316 align:middle line:84%
loves that you
have that necklace.

00:41:38.316 --> 00:41:40.737 align:middle line:84%
She worked really hard
for you to get that.

00:41:40.737 --> 00:41:42.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I'll leave you with that.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.306 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:44.306 --> 00:41:45.977 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:45.977 --> 00:41:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, you
can applaud for them.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.270 align:middle line:90%
How did we do over here?

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.228 align:middle line:90%
How'd you do over here?

00:41:51.228 --> 00:41:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Did you get-- after that!

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.174 align:middle line:90%
How'd you guys do?

00:41:55.174 --> 00:41:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Anybody get someone through?

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.537 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:57.537 --> 00:41:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, there we go.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:90%
This one again.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.500 align:middle line:90%
This one, she's dangerous.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Her show next.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:02.894 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:02.894 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're gonna
hear what you've got.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Who'd you bring through, love?

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.662 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, her mom, Ruth.

00:42:09.662 --> 00:42:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mom, Ruth.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mom, Ruth.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:12.909 align:middle line:90%
And she got her spot on.

00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What did you get?

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I saw a very
strong, blonde woman.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.915 align:middle line:90%
I knew she was from Germany.

00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And then she just--
it's gonna make me cry.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's OK.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.676 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
she wanted her

00:42:28.676 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
to know how much she loved
her, because she could never

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.470 align:middle line:90%
tell her growing up.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.270 align:middle line:84%
She said, I made
her a strong woman,

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:41.470 align:middle line:84%
but I never-- she never knew how
much I loved her and how much--

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.520 align:middle line:90%
and how proud I am of her.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.940 align:middle line:84%
She just came
through over, and she

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:84%
says, I can still hear her--
I mean, just the feeling.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, that's it.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It was so-- oh, and how
much she misses you as well.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And your mom passed
away four years ago.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if she was still
alive or in Germany, but--

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's great.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.300 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a fabulous message.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's great that she was
able to drop it into your mind,

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and you picked that
up telepathically.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And can I just do a
little bit more than that?

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Because you've done the work.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:19.210 align:middle line:90%
You've opened the door for me.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now I can just go
right in, if I could.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it
was Anne, you said?

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:22.868 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ruth.

00:43:22.868 --> 00:43:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who's Anne?

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Suzanne.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.948 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're Suzanne.

00:43:26.948 --> 00:43:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there an Anne in
the spirit world?

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:29.844 align:middle line:90%
Anna or Anne?

00:43:29.844 --> 00:43:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I know there is.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.301 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Helene?

00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Anne?

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's an
Anna or an Anne over there.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Anna is my
husband's grandmother.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, so she's
in the spirit world, right?

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.245 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:43:37.245 --> 00:43:38.135 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
there's an Anna over there,

00:43:38.135 --> 00:43:39.560 align:middle line:90%
because she knows of her.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.150 align:middle line:90%
She talks to her now.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They talked to each other
about coming here today.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that about--
what about the new car?

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So I know about-- there
was a car problem.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure which
one this is here.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Was there a car, that you either
got a car or returned a car

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.626 align:middle line:84%
or there was a car issue, or
something about the car being

00:43:54.626 --> 00:43:55.980 align:middle line:90%
repaired, the car needs repair?

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.896 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yesterday.

00:43:56.896 --> 00:43:58.164 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yesterday.

00:43:58.164 --> 00:44:00.145 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband's
car was repaired.

00:44:00.145 --> 00:44:01.644 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
just told me that.

00:44:01.644 --> 00:44:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Just told me that.

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very aware that
the people-- yes, I

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:06.410 align:middle line:90%
understand that.

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, she wants
to get things right,

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and she's going on about that.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
She grew up with
that whole thing

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.410 align:middle line:90%
of it being right or wrong.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:13.035 align:middle line:84%
I've gotta be right,
because my father,

00:44:13.035 --> 00:44:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't want him to hurt me.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know that.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.597 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:44:15.597 --> 00:44:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know that.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because he was
a very much a disciplinary,

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:20.139 align:middle line:90%
her dad.

00:44:20.139 --> 00:44:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she
got a lot of that stuff

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that you say-- which thank
you very much for doing

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.284 align:middle line:84%
that-- that she couldn't show
her emotion because she was

00:44:26.284 --> 00:44:29.046 align:middle line:84%
afraid that that would
be considered weak,

00:44:29.046 --> 00:44:31.045 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't be weak
in front of her father.

00:44:31.045 --> 00:44:31.894 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:44:31.894 --> 00:44:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I got that.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell you
that-- go on, go on-- there

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.310 align:middle line:84%
must've been two repair garages
or two places he had to go to.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:41.494 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:44:41.494 --> 00:44:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because that's
what she's telling me now.

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:45.070 align:middle line:90%
She's telling me that.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
that, the two places.

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And she's just making sure this
is right and you understand it.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:50.660 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, you know,
there are two things wrong

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:51.460 align:middle line:90%
with that car.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not an
expert on the car,

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:54.220 align:middle line:84%
but there are two things
that are wrong with it.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And they might fix one thing,
but it's something else.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.804 align:middle line:84%
And I know I want to
go under the hood.

00:44:57.804 --> 00:45:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And me, James, my
reference is not cars,

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.061 align:middle line:84%
but I know I've got to replace
something there-- a spark plug?

00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Do they still use spark plugs?

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.477 align:middle line:84%
It's something there, and
his computer timing is off

00:45:06.477 --> 00:45:08.643 align:middle line:84%
on things, so there must
be a computer with his car,

00:45:08.643 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
or something, because
something's off timing-wise.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Timing?

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:11.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:12.926 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
this is so funny

00:45:12.926 --> 00:45:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to watch me try to do
this, because this is not

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.999 align:middle line:90%
part of my world.

00:45:15.999 --> 00:45:18.498 align:middle line:84%
But there's something about--
she wants me to give something

00:45:18.498 --> 00:45:20.760 align:middle line:84%
about timing which talks to
another part of the engine

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's two things,
not just one.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.186 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to give that to you.

00:45:25.186 --> 00:45:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you
have a sister, by the way?

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.406 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:27.406 --> 00:45:29.869 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is she older
than you or is she younger?

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And who created the dollhouse
when you were a little girl?

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't there a dollhouse?

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You made
that dollhouse, didn't you?

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.011 align:middle line:84%
And you were insistent
upon having that dollhouse

00:45:39.011 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:90%
or making the dollhouse.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know you stole some
things from your mother

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.292 align:middle line:84%
to put into that
little dollhouse.

00:45:44.292 --> 00:45:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Little things-- I don't know,
pieces of jewelry or something.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.060 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to make that--
you understand that?

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.077 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:45:53.077 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
just an old memory,

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and she's just giving
it as validation.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:56.975 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She knew?

00:45:56.975 --> 00:45:57.933 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She knew.

00:45:57.933 --> 00:45:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oops.

00:45:59.025 --> 00:46:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, she knew.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she knew.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But I like that you gave
your mother the freedom

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.447 align:middle line:90%
that she needed.

00:46:04.447 --> 00:46:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you, because
this is a very strong healing

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.300 align:middle line:90%
for the spirit for her mother.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.310 align:middle line:90%
She needed this healing.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:10.950 align:middle line:90%
She's waited a long time.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Four years has it been?

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:84%
She's waited four years to
come here to tell you this.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
just think about that,

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.560 align:middle line:84%
how long a spirit sometimes
waits for the healing

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's great.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You must have a little
girl running around

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.375 align:middle line:90%
or a daughter or something.

00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:27.331 align:middle line:84%
Who has the daughter
in the family?

00:46:27.331 --> 00:46:29.455 align:middle line:84%
Did you lose a daughter,
like a baby, a miscarriage

00:46:29.455 --> 00:46:30.290 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.785 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I had a miscarriage.

00:46:30.785 --> 00:46:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
because it's a daughter.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a daughter.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.590 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a daughter
in the spirit world.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I know your mother
takes care of her,

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and I know she's
a softie to her.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know the
piano means a lot.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.300 align:middle line:90%
So playing the piano, OK?

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.105 align:middle line:84%
So your mother is
telling me that she's

00:46:46.105 --> 00:46:48.480 align:middle line:84%
teaching this girl piano or
doing something with a piano.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to sound weird,
because your mother never

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:50.820 align:middle line:90%
played the piano.

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I know that
this music is very significant.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Music is, yes.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because music is
very important to your family.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:57.266 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
your mother either

00:46:57.266 --> 00:46:59.050 align:middle line:84%
wanted to learn
the piano herself--

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
tell you something,

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:84%
her father taught her
that when she passed over.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Because her father is softer
than he was when he was living,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and I know the piano was
one of the first things

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:11.150 align:middle line:84%
that she learned over there,
because her mother's there

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:13.784 align:middle line:84%
as well, gardening the
flowers, that was big for her.

00:47:13.784 --> 00:47:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she
wants me to tell you

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.650 align:middle line:90%
that she's learned piano here.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.680 align:middle line:84%
We're playing the keys, and
I'm teaching your daughter.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.804 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching your daughter.

00:47:19.804 --> 00:47:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So we're passing this on.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:22.347 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to tell you that.

00:47:22.347 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:90%
That's really, really important.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:25.869 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
you're welcome.

00:47:25.869 --> 00:47:26.787 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:26.787 --> 00:47:29.541 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:29.541 --> 00:47:30.380 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now we're going
to switch it up a little bit,

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have the
other people be the mediums,

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to be the receiver.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.506 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, you're going
to be the partic-- you're

00:47:36.506 --> 00:47:37.672 align:middle line:90%
going to give them the name.

00:47:37.672 --> 00:47:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So the people that are the
mediums, just close your eyes

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and open up your mind
to whatever happens.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And the person in
front of you, you're

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.500 align:middle line:84%
going to give them the
name and the relationship

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.370 align:middle line:90%
of someone you want to contact.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, begin.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:55.747 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.747 --> 00:47:56.830 align:middle line:90%
And just see what you get.

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Let them drop it in
telepathically into your mind.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.152 align:middle line:84%
OK, begin to give
messages, please.

00:48:06.152 --> 00:48:07.822 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you get,
don't think of it.

00:48:07.822 --> 00:48:08.530 align:middle line:90%
Just give it out.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:90%
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:48:18.970 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:90%


00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, folks.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, how many people did well?

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, over here?

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Over here?

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:15.111 align:middle line:90%
You guys are very connected.

00:49:15.111 --> 00:49:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.364 align:middle line:90%
What'd you get?

00:49:16.364 --> 00:49:17.280 align:middle line:90%
What did she tell you?

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Because then I'm going
to go on top of that.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: What
did she tell me?

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.880 align:middle line:90%
She saw the beard.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And but she said it was dark,
but in his younger years,

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.750 align:middle line:90%
it was darker.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'm thinking of
him in his later years.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Nah,
he was younger.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And she picked up
on a horse, but-- and trails.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:35.240 align:middle line:90%
But we have goats.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what was the name?

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband?

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Saul.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.081 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Saul?

00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:39.937 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:39.937 --> 00:49:40.520 align:middle line:90%
And what else?

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The happiness.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.863 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The happiness.

00:49:42.863 --> 00:49:45.260 align:middle line:84%
She picked up on the
energy of happiness,

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.185 align:middle line:84%
which he had a great
sense of humor.

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As I
connect with your husband,

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.500 align:middle line:84%
if I could-- because as
you're thinking about them,

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.520 align:middle line:90%
they're right here.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just us opening
up our minds,

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and then telepathically just
letting him send me a thought.

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.032 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that you
must be wearing a ring

00:50:01.032 --> 00:50:03.490 align:middle line:84%
or you must be wearing something
of his with you right now.

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
are, aren't you?

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:04.954 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:50:04.954 --> 00:50:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What
are you wearing?

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm wearing
his-- the wedding--

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that
a ring you're wearing?

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His wedding ring
and a heart that he gave me.

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I couldn't see
it, because I have no eyesight.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I know he said you're
wearing a ring of his.

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I also--
the engagement ring.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.983 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, perfect.

00:50:15.983 --> 00:50:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I also know, as I connect with
Saul-- and what is your name,

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:19.310 align:middle line:90%
sweet lady?

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:19.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Deborah.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:19.655 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Deborah.

00:50:19.655 --> 00:50:20.080 align:middle line:90%
I love Deborah.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.913 align:middle line:90%
I think she's great.

00:50:20.913 --> 00:50:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I think you're wonderful.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.266 align:middle line:84%
I think that you get in
your own way sometimes.

00:50:24.266 --> 00:50:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes if you
can't get something through,

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:84%
you're thinking about
it a little too much.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So I want you-- you know,
you're very psychic,

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:90%
you're very intuitive.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have problems with
your stomach area here.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.436 align:middle line:84%
You're a little
nervous in the stomach.

00:50:36.436 --> 00:50:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you get
a little agitated,

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.704 align:middle line:90%
you'll feel it in your tummy.

00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what that means?

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.578 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you might
not be able to eat

00:50:42.578 --> 00:50:44.850 align:middle line:84%
right, or no appetite
or something.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.167 align:middle line:90%
I feel a little bit like this,

00:50:46.167 --> 00:50:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Butterflies.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:48.333 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Butterflies.

00:50:48.333 --> 00:50:49.944 align:middle line:90%
Like, nervousness, OK?

00:50:49.944 --> 00:50:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I think you did a great job.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I think you did a great job.

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:52.840 align:middle line:90%
What is-- your name again is?

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Dina.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Dina.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I think you did Dina
a great service.

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I think Dina, your
husband tells me

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.670 align:middle line:84%
you have something on
your purse of his as well.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A picture.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In your purse.

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:02.680 align:middle line:90%
It's behind--

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And--

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah!

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, don't say?

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
behind, like in a pocket.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It's in a pocket.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he shows me the pocket

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.870 align:middle line:90%
that the photo is in there.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And it's
not just a photo.

00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:11.469 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:51:11.469 --> 00:51:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, don't tell me.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't feed the medium.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.574 align:middle line:90%
I've eaten enough.

00:51:15.574 --> 00:51:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I just want Saul
to bring through.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, Saul in some ways I feel
is an academic time of person.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.910 align:middle line:90%
So I feel academia or academic.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I feel that means a lot
to him, to learn things,

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.052 align:middle line:90%
to study things, to read things.

00:51:26.052 --> 00:51:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a
feeling in the lifetime,

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.800 align:middle line:84%
he might have been a
reader, a book reader.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was.

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.423 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was, yes.

00:51:31.423 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you still have
a lot of his books, he says.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.521 align:middle line:84%
So you still have
a lot of his books.

00:51:35.521 --> 00:51:38.532 align:middle line:84%
And I know he's telling me that
when you go-- what about 8:30.

00:51:38.532 --> 00:51:39.841 align:middle line:90%
Leave 8:30 alone.

00:51:39.841 --> 00:51:40.340 align:middle line:90%
8:30.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.140 align:middle line:84%
He said 8:30, so I'm going
to put that to the side.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't know what
he's talking about.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Send it back.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:44.910 align:middle line:90%
He's got to calm down.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.220 align:middle line:90%
He's very excited.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:90%
He's cerebral.

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.360 align:middle line:90%
He's a mental person.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:49.914 align:middle line:90%
He thinks.

00:51:49.914 --> 00:51:52.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, whenever she wants
to be with me, when Dina wants

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.745 align:middle line:84%
to be with me, she'll go to
my place where my books are.

00:51:54.745 --> 00:51:55.620 align:middle line:90%
She'll go in the den.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:84%
She'll go in some type
of an office or a study

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.520 align:middle line:90%
where my books are.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
to you, please?

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.633 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:52:01.633 --> 00:52:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you speak to him.

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that you
speak to him in that room,

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:06.850 align:middle line:84%
especially he's
there in that room.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So he follows you
anywhere, wherever you go.

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to know,
if you go into that room

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:13.930 align:middle line:84%
where his books are-- he
said he has books, his books,

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and he wants to go
there, he's with you.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
having flowers.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
the flowers in a painting.

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.443 align:middle line:84%
There are flowers in
some kind of a painting

00:52:22.443 --> 00:52:23.910 align:middle line:90%
or a floral thing.

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:25.420 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know where that is.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
he did paintings.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He painted?

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to
find that, because I

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.700 align:middle line:84%
know you must have two
children, you have two kids.

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Or one kid?

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.670 align:middle line:90%
No kids?

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:36.850 align:middle line:90%
He did.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Why is
he saying two kids

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.407 align:middle line:90%
are very important to him.

00:52:39.407 --> 00:52:41.865 align:middle line:84%
So he might have had 10, but
two are very important to him.

00:52:41.865 --> 00:52:43.656 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, one's
sitting right here.

00:52:43.656 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, there you go.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: His daughter.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:46.868 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:52:46.868 --> 00:52:48.925 align:middle line:84%
So I don't what it is
with the flower picture,

00:52:48.925 --> 00:52:51.664 align:middle line:84%
the painting with
flowers in it or on it.

00:52:51.664 --> 00:52:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you
have that painting of--

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.913 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There is a really
important painting to both

00:52:55.913 --> 00:52:59.000 align:middle line:84%
of us that would look like
flowers from a distance

00:52:59.000 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:90%
because of the--

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would he
know of that painting?

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would he
have created that painting?

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Love that.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is there somebody
who passed over with a gun?

00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Who took their life with a gun?

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:12.804 align:middle line:90%
Was there a suicide with a gun?

00:53:12.804 --> 00:53:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My cousin.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.803 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your cousin.

00:53:14.803 --> 00:53:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And suicide with a gun, correct?

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.708 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why,
but she's talking

00:53:17.708 --> 00:53:18.917 align:middle line:90%
about her father, her father.

00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:20.291 align:middle line:84%
So he must be over
there as well.

00:53:20.291 --> 00:53:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He is.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that she

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.564 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a good
sense of herself,

00:53:23.564 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and I know that she watches
you and she lives through you.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We
were like sisters.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:31.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna cry.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.380 align:middle line:84%
See, it's so real when
you feel it in the heart,

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.900 align:middle line:90%
you feel it in that heart space.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And can I say, thank
you for helping her.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for helping
her in the darkest hours,

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and I want to say that your dad
was able to bring her through.

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.180 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to bring her through.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:49.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm as strong as
an ox, this guy, this Saul guy.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
climbing in the bed with him.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:53.483 align:middle line:84%
So you must have climbed
in the hospital bed

00:53:53.483 --> 00:53:55.644 align:middle line:84%
at one point, some
kind of a bed.

00:53:55.644 --> 00:53:57.435 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Not this
time, but once before.

00:53:57.435 --> 00:53:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Once before.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Because he gives me a memory
of climbing into a bed

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and then saying,
what are you doing,

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.770 align:middle line:84%
the people that
are working there?

00:54:01.770 --> 00:54:03.047 align:middle line:90%
You can't stay in that bed.

00:54:03.047 --> 00:54:04.380 align:middle line:90%
You need to get out of that bed.

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And I've got to tell you that.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I also get a sense of coughing.

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.320 align:middle line:90%
At one point, coughing a lot.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.867 align:middle line:90%
And he was ready to go.

00:54:10.867 --> 00:54:12.200 align:middle line:90%
He was ready to go when he went.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But he wants to thank you for
giving a part of his life.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:16.980 align:middle line:90%
Really, really, your kind soul.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And this girl really
wants to thank you.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And she wants me to-- are
her parents still alive,

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.550 align:middle line:90%
or one of her parents?

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: One of
her-- her mother.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:25.951 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Her mother, yeah?

00:54:25.951 --> 00:54:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Because would you let
her know she's OK now?

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Her mind is better.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:90%
She was a manic depressive.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.762 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She was, yeah.

00:54:31.762 --> 00:54:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She said,
I was manic depressive.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And not anymore.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.596 align:middle line:90%
So that's all stabilized out.

00:54:36.596 --> 00:54:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But she's looking
and seeing the things

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.855 align:middle line:84%
she left, the remnants she
left behind with her illness.

00:54:40.855 --> 00:54:41.772 align:middle line:90%
And it was an illness.

00:54:41.772 --> 00:54:43.271 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't mean
to hurt anybody.

00:54:43.271 --> 00:54:44.440 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't hurt a fly.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.951 align:middle line:84%
But she wants to thank you
for looking at her photograph,

00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:49.575 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it all the time,
with all the other photographs

00:54:49.575 --> 00:54:50.190 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost right
there in the center.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she said, thank you

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.280 align:middle line:84%
for doing that for me,
for honoring me that way.

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.110 align:middle line:90%
So god bless you.

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you both with that.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.563 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:54:58.563 --> 00:55:01.521 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:01.521 --> 00:55:02.157 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.157 --> 00:55:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How'd we do
over here in this group?

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.130 align:middle line:84%
This group, I have not
forgotten about you guys.

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:07.546 align:middle line:84%
You're very, very
important to me.

00:55:07.546 --> 00:55:08.240 align:middle line:90%
How did you do?

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Anybody get someone?

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:90%
I know you did.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.150 align:middle line:84%
You guys have your own
little world going over here.

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:14.307 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:14.307 --> 00:55:19.897 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So her father,
John, he had a stomach--

00:55:19.897 --> 00:55:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A stomach problem?

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:23.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A stomach
problem, and he basically

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:25.800 align:middle line:84%
wanted to talk to her
about that and to let

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.820 align:middle line:84%
her know that he's
OK now but that he

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.820 align:middle line:90%
did suffer when he died.

00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:30.444 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
was good validation.

00:55:30.444 --> 00:55:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but he's OK now.

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:32.720 align:middle line:90%
So she really needed some--

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's great.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:34.395 align:middle line:90%
Great validation.

00:55:34.395 --> 00:55:36.109 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever write, by the way?

00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Because he talks about writing.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.316 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:55:38.316 --> 00:55:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm a writer.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're a writer?

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, yeah, I've
been-- yes, I'm a writer.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:43.830 align:middle line:90%
I need to own that.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.654 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:55:45.654 --> 00:55:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And not only do you need to
own it, you need to finish it.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: You're right.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I need to finish it.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you know
you need to finish it.

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that he comes over
with a grandmother as well.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So I know his mother
must be over there.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to-- she's
smiling, peaches and cream.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:58.990 align:middle line:90%
She's smiling.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.967 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:55:59.967 --> 00:56:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, really, really well.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And whose mother
passed over here?

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.880 align:middle line:90%
That's it, your mom.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.580 align:middle line:90%
I get her.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a mother coming back
and forth, back and forth,

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:07.000 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:07.865 align:middle line:90%
Did you speak to her?

00:56:07.865 --> 00:56:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Did you try to speak to her?

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:10.025 align:middle line:84%
Was that the person
you tried to contact?

00:56:10.025 --> 00:56:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So I get the mother
really, really strong.

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:13.760 align:middle line:90%
And her first name is what?

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Irene.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:15.343 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Irene.

00:56:15.343 --> 00:56:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name, darling?

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Megan.

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Megan, were you
able to bring through something

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:90%
from Irene, his mom?

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.285 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just got that
she took a lot of her identity

00:56:23.285 --> 00:56:24.765 align:middle line:90%
through him and his personality.

00:56:24.765 --> 00:56:26.230 align:middle line:90%
She's real proud of him.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Great, great.

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me just build
on that, if I might.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:28.980 align:middle line:90%
And your name is?

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:29.245 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Doug.

00:56:29.245 --> 00:56:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Doug.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Doug, I think you're
a lovely person.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
you're a lovely person.

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.814 align:middle line:84%
I think you give up
on yourself too much.

00:56:34.814 --> 00:56:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You don't
see things through.

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:38.330 align:middle line:84%
You're not able to get
things accomplished

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.760 align:middle line:84%
or see them through because
I don't believe in myself.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And is your dad still living?

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he is.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
I know as your mother,

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.085 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she feels
very ill to me at one point.

00:56:47.085 --> 00:56:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I feel
it's a long, prolonged type

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:90%
of illness.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And I feel ill.

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:52.481 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel like myself.

00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I really, really didn't
mean to give that to the family,

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.422 align:middle line:90%
but she had no choice, she said.

00:56:56.422 --> 00:56:58.630 align:middle line:84%
She's a lady who tries--
she gives to everybody else.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:59.714 align:middle line:90%
She forgets about herself.

00:56:59.714 --> 00:57:00.671 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Who's Michael or Mike?

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.073 align:middle line:90%
Do you know that name?

00:57:02.073 --> 00:57:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have a cousin.

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:03.824 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hmm.

00:57:03.824 --> 00:57:05.620 align:middle line:90%
And how's his father doing?

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's still living.

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are they getting
along with each other or not?

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Would you find out?

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I want them
to come together.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.370 align:middle line:84%
She said there's a
problem, there's a rift.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And she wants them
to come together.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there's a
cat that's passed over.

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a
dog that's passed--

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.695 align:middle line:90%
two dogs have passed over.

00:57:18.695 --> 00:57:20.060 align:middle line:84%
She has all the
animals over there.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.020 align:middle line:90%
She loved the animals.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
she loved animals.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
animals all around her.

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:23.370 align:middle line:90%
Lots of dogs.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This morning,
we did an animal show.

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me tell you.

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.616 align:middle line:84%
She comes with
all these animals.

00:57:26.616 --> 00:57:28.167 align:middle line:90%
So she has all of her animals.

00:57:28.167 --> 00:57:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tell you one thing.

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:90%
Your mother's a very sweet lady.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.220 align:middle line:90%
She has her weight back.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.220 align:middle line:90%
She has her weight back.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:33.960 align:middle line:90%
She's back.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Her hair is beautiful.

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.130 align:middle line:90%
She has nice hair now.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, she's able
to see her friends and sisters.

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She really
wanted to tell you that.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:42.880 align:middle line:90%
And I like to cook things.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.690 align:middle line:90%
So she's cooking me things here.

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:45.799 align:middle line:90%
She's cooking you cookies.

00:57:45.799 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:90%
She's cooking you things.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.295 align:middle line:90%
You understand this?

00:57:47.295 --> 00:57:48.045 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Fudge.

00:57:48.045 --> 00:57:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's cooking.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.417 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She loved fudge.

00:57:50.417 --> 00:57:51.416 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fudge, oh.

00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So she must have
cooked that for you.

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to have
fudge in her honor.

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.790 align:middle line:90%
And I know that she's going to.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So I know this weekend, if
you could, make some fudge.

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.247 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you, there's
a move around you.

00:58:02.247 --> 00:58:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's a
vision to have a bigger house,

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:08.140 align:middle line:84%
or go to a different place, but
it's coming your way, she said.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That sounds good.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.997 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she's
just a thought away.

00:58:11.997 --> 00:58:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Just a thought away.

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:14.830 align:middle line:90%
So keep that in your heart.

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:15.541 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

00:58:15.541 --> 00:58:16.022 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:58:16.022 --> 00:58:16.522 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:16.522 --> 00:58:18.209 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:18.209 --> 00:58:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think you did
really, really well, everybody.

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I think you did
really, really well.

00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
telepathy is really, again,

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:25.860 align:middle line:90%
receiving thoughts.

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.157 align:middle line:84%
And the more open we
are to receive them,

00:58:28.157 --> 00:58:29.240 align:middle line:90%
then the more we can hear.

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just opening up
your mind to hear.
