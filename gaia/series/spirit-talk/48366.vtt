00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.485 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.090 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Hi, hi.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.293 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:37.192 align:middle line:84%
And thank you all
so very, very much.

00:00:37.192 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to
"Spirit Talk," where

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.304 align:middle line:84%
I take you one step
closer to heaven.

00:00:40.304 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we would
start the day off

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
with just asking all of you
here in the audience, how

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.296 align:middle line:84%
many of you have had
signs from spirit that we

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:90%
know they're around.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.257 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and what kind of
signs did you have?

00:00:51.257 --> 00:00:52.215 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Electrical.

00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Electrical.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:90%
So-

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Zapping?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%
Electrical.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
How many have had electrical
things happen around the house?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.666 align:middle line:84%
Lights flickering on and
off and this sort of thing?

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Computers, cellphones
acting very strange, right?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times spirit
will come through where

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
they can affect the magnetic
field of electrical objects.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And for some spirits,
that's an easy way

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:90%
to come through for them.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
How many people have had
dreams of your loved ones?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Mostly all of you.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Mostly all of you too probably.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Dreams are the number one
way that spirits communicate.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one way
they're able to communicate.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why you might
ask-- and I'll tell you.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.335 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm psychic
I know you're

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
going to ask me that question--
is that in the dream state

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
when we go to sleep at
night, our spirit body,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
which is a replica
of the physical body,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.480 align:middle line:84%
is lying within
the physical body.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And at nighttime we go to
sleep in the dream state,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
spirit leaves the physical body
and goes out of the head area

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and goes over to the
spiritual dimensions.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Strange isn't it?

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you're just
about to fall asleep

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and you feel you're
shaking, and that's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
because your spirit
is not leaving

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
the correct axis of the body
so it comes right back in.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that wild?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I bet you didn't think of that.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.324 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
when we leave and we

00:01:57.324 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:84%
go to the spiritual
side of life--

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.890 align:middle line:84%
a dream state-- we go
to the spiritual world.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.217 align:middle line:90%
We go to those dimensions.

00:02:02.217 --> 00:02:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And you see your friends
and your loved ones

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and your guides
and your teachers,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and you will actually
connect with them.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, sometimes
it feels like, wow, this

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:90%
is more than a dream, right?

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:90%
It feels very, very real.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.984 align:middle line:84%
You've had that
experience, right?

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, oh my gosh,
and I want to stay here.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.816 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
back to Earth, right?

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So I know that when we
wake up in the morning

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
it's like, wow, that
was more than a dream.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And the way the conscious
mind receives it,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.527 align:middle line:84%
it does seem like a
dream, but then some.

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And the conscious mind
can't get in the way.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
The rational mindset
doesn't get in the way

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
so it's easier for us to
see it as that connection.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I call them a crossover
to the other side of life.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And when spirit crosses over
to the other side of life

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
when it's time for death--
so-called death because there

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as death--
but when it's that time

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:84%
they go back to the
prime of their life.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.091 align:middle line:84%
They go back to
their younger times--

00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.982 align:middle line:84%
30s, 40s, whatever they
feel that they want to go to

00:02:50.982 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:84%
in the prime of their life,
whatever their soul wants

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to go to and feels connected
with, it will go to.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And they will portray
themselves that way.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why in the dream
state many times you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.531 align:middle line:84%
will see these spirits
looking very, very young.

00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's so interesting
because I think

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:84%
many times we have to
get out of our humanness

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and get more to the
spiritual side of ourselves.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Get back to our soul
selves, and really

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
understand what's going on and
realize that we're never alone,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:90%
that they're always with us.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.032 align:middle line:84%
So dreams are another
very good sign.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Another way-- anybody else
have another different way

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.416 align:middle line:90%
you've communicated with spirit?

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
thought I saw them.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:90%
They looked exactly like them.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes you
see somebody that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
looks just like your
spirit friend, right?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Now what is that?

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, is it them standing there?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily think
so, but what I think happens

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the spirit is projecting
an image into your mind.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So we call it
clairvoyance, right?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's a mind-to-mind
communication,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
which is exactly what I do.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to see that in
a little while demonstrated.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.753 align:middle line:84%
But what the spirit
will do is they'll

00:03:50.753 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:84%
demonstrate into your mind
a projection of their vision

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
of their face of
what they look like,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.432 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes when
you see somebody

00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
that projection is
there and you're like,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.200 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, that's my
daughter, that's my father.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that looks just like them.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I cannot tell you how many times
I've been in this situation

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
where there's been an audience
in front of me and I've seen

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
relatives of mine.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:84%
My own relatives
that have passed over

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, oh wow,
that looks like so and so.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
But I know it isn't, but
it's the spirit's way

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.176 align:middle line:84%
of coming through to
us and through to me

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and letting me know they're
around me and the signs

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that they have, the
signs they give us.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Another one, another
great one, anybody

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.282 align:middle line:84%
have smells of
perfume or cigarettes?

00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad's cologne.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Dad's cologne and
cigarette smell.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.636 align:middle line:84%
So something that you can
really associate with them

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
then that's how they
will come through.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting because
not all spirits come through

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.452 align:middle line:84%
with smells or come
through with electricity

00:04:40.452 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
or come through in
the dream state.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It's really up to that
particular spirit,

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that individual
spirit and how they

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
want to try and
attempt communication.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's the signs.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Another way they come through,
which I'm sure a lot of you

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
have not thought about, but I'll
share with you is inspiration.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.845 align:middle line:90%
Inspiration.

00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the shower
and all of a sudden

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.886 align:middle line:84%
you have this thought or
you're sitting down and all

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden a thought
comes into your head.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.512 align:middle line:84%
How many people have driven a
car, you're driving the car,

00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:10.595 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a sudden
you think of somebody-- I

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:84%
know it happened on
the way here probably.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I know-- and it's right there
and you're like, oh my gosh.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever think that
they're sitting next to you

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
in the passenger seat and
they're sending out a thought?

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.573 align:middle line:90%
So it happens like that.

00:05:24.573 --> 00:05:26.156 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that's really
what we're going

00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:90%
to talk about today is signs.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we do the
communication part of this,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.916 align:middle line:84%
it's important
that you all know--

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and those that are
watching-- that I never

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.866 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to happen.

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I never know what's
going to happen.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like a crap shoot
in that I stand up here

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and I open up my mind and my
heart to the spirit world,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and I work with
guides and I work

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84%
with your guides
who come here today.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.724 align:middle line:84%
So many of you who come
into this room here

00:05:47.724 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and people that are watching
this, many times you'll

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:90%
have spirit guides around you.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we put ourselves
into a particular space,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
we are being receptive
to the spirit.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking them
on another wavelength,

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.724 align:middle line:84%
dear spirit friends come
through and I'm open to receive.

00:06:02.724 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's really what I do.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I just stand and I
receive information

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and I just give it out.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And there are some spirits that
are very good at communication

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and there are other
spirits that are OK.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.474 align:middle line:90%
So we'll see.

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's always good to
do this because you'll

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.942 align:middle line:84%
see the varied skill set
of the different spirits.

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:90%
So cool.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:90%
So are you with me?

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready to go on a
journey and take a ride?

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:90%
So we'll do that.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So before we get
to the journey, any

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.472 align:middle line:84%
questions that you might have
for me or general questions

00:06:30.472 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that might help people at
home that are watching this

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
or that you've thought
about over these years

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and you've always wanted to have
a medium to ask this question?

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Anybody have a couple questions?

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I would like you to
address spirit orbs because we

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.767 align:middle line:84%
see them whizzing
by all the time.

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:46.391 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spirit
orbs, another sign

00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:90%
that spirit is with us.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.205 align:middle line:84%
So spirit orbs--
and a lot of people

00:06:49.205 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:84%
have experienced
those-- and spirit orbs

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
many times will show
themselves in a photograph.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's this-- all the time.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And it will look like
bubbles of light.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:84%
What I believe spirit
orbs is another sign,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
another way that spirit
comes through and trying

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to, if you will,
project an image.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's really
projecting an energy.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Now this is really interesting
because many people

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
think that it's one spirit
when you see a spirit

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
orb and a ball of light
that it's one spirit.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's several
spirits who've

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
come together and
projecting together

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.217 align:middle line:84%
a thought, an energy, and
that's what's projected.

00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:90%
I think that's what it is.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.075 align:middle line:90%
It's a feeling I get.

00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:26.491 align:middle line:84%
When I see pictures
of orbs I know

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
it's several spirits at
once with that one orb.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can go
into rooms and you

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
could see several orbs
in that photograph.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I once went down to Ford's
Theatre down in Washington, DC

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and I sat on the stage and there
were multitudes of spirit orbs.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And I knew there were all
these beings around me.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
way that they come

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:90%
through as signs, spirit orbs.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Another question
someone might have?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.527 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Spirit
through children?

00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spirit
through children.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
more than genetics--

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.689 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.504 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: But how that works.

00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Spirit through children.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Very common.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So children-- remember that
children are very, very open,

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Children are very, very
open because number one,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
they've just come
from the spirit world.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Two years, four
years, five years.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So their mindset is
very much about spirit.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And looking, if you will,
at the world around them

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and measuring it in terms
of, say, our spiritual lens.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So they see things as a
spirit being in a way.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So they have not yet been
taught about hate, about fear,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:90%
about limitation, right?

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So they're still very open.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know
the truth, ask a child.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you exactly
what the truth is.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.409 align:middle line:90%
There's no dirt.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no fear.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
They're not
embellishing anything.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:90%
They're not dishonest.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
real what they got.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:90%
So they're very, very open.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And because they're
open, of course

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
they'll see spirits
all the time.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.107 align:middle line:84%
So I often say that imaginary
playmates aren't really

00:08:52.107 --> 00:08:52.940 align:middle line:90%
imaginary playmates.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:84%
They're probably-- sometimes
it could be for sure,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of time it's usually
spirit that they're around

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing
around somebody.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And it happened to me
when I was a child also.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I used to see
spirit all the time.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And as a kid you don't
think anything of it.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
That's just your natural
way of living and behaving.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't know anything
else and no one

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:84%
has taught you yet that
oh, that's not real.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I believe that children--
so interesting-- I believe

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that children are
taught about fear.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that as children
they'll tell the adults,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
yes, this is what's
happening, and they

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.820 align:middle line:84%
describe exactly
what's going on.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And the parent, the teacher,
the adult, no, no, no, no.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this,
I'll accept you.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Do this and I love you.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Do this and you're
accepted in school.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:90%
You have to do these rules.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's so weird.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is happening
here, the parent or adult

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
will say certain things
and children see energy.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Children always see energy.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.815 align:middle line:84%
So they see the energy
coming out of the mouth,

00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:84%
they'll see the auric
energy around the person.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's so interesting.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I have found that many times
the words that come out

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
of the adults mouth don't equal
the vibration of their energy.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So the child will
be like-- they learn

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to distrust the
adult right away.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So they learn to distrust the
adult right away because what's

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the mouth
is not equal to the energy

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that the child is
seeing around them.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.309 align:middle line:90%
So pretty interesting.

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So they're very,
very open, children.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.367 align:middle line:84%
And I really do help to
promote their intuition.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell a
child, what do you feel?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.946 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, I saw my grandpa
last night in a dream.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:90%
What did he look like?

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.659 align:middle line:90%
Where did you find him?

00:10:25.659 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Ask them questions.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Where is he?

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.855 align:middle line:84%
It's very good to nurture
the intuition with a child.

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it's also
our responsibility

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
as adults to really
foster and to nurture

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:90%
the intuition of children.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to guide
you through meditation.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have music we're
going to play now.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're gonna
start with that, OK?

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Music, please.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And those people at
home that are watching,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
you can close your
eyes, too, and just

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.190 align:middle line:90%
listen to the sound of my voice.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Just close your eyes gently.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And listen to the
music behind my voice.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:90%
We worry so much as humans.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:90%
We worry so, so much, don't we?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:90%
We put so much on our plate.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:90%
The past has already happened.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So not much we
can do about that.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And the future is yet
to be, so no reason

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
to waste the energy
of the future.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So all we truly have is
this moment right now.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So in your mind,
just put out there

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make the
most of this moment

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
now and truly live fully
in this moment now.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It's this gorgeous
moment that you

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.723 align:middle line:84%
could create this
particular time.

00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit there, becoming
very mindful of your feet

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:90%
on the floor.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful of your
backs on the chairs

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and your legs, your
shoulders, and your arms.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Your hands, your
neck, and your head.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful that you as a
spiritual being are limitless.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:90%
You go way above the head.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Your energy can project
way, way beyond this room.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Where ever you are right now,
go way, way beyond above you.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Beyond our solar system even.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You as a spirit, you project
higher and higher, far,

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
far away, up and above.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Your spirit knows no limitation.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So below you through the feet,
your energy, your spirit,

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts go all the way
down through to the Earth

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:84%
to connect with Mother Earth
energy, that beautiful Gaia

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
That beautiful energy
that nurtures us,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that brings us
balance, that brings us

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:84%
food, that brings
us the oneness.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:90%
We are connected to the Earth.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:90%
We are connected to the heavens.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And you as a spiritual
being, as a spirit

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
having this human
experience, can

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
be part of the heavens and part
of the Earth and part of one

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
another as you sit
right now in this space.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit in
this space, just

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
be mindful now of your
heart, your beautiful heart.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
This lovely, lovely
area of the heart

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
pumping out the blood to nurture
all the cells, the organs,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and the muscles in the body.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And just acknowledge
that beautiful, loving,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:90%
beating of the heart.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And with each beat is a bright
golden light just enveloping

00:13:54.150 --> 00:14:00.490 align:middle line:84%
each cell, each
organ, each muscle.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:90%
See that and be that.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
See that and be that.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.717 align:middle line:90%
See that and be that.

00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
To enforce this
beautiful light which

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
you are and your connection
to heaven worlds and the earth

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:84%
worlds, we're going
to use a breath.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The breath is a gift from God
for the breath sustains life.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So together let's imagine a
beautiful golden star far,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:90%
far above us.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Far, far away.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And as we bring that
beautiful golden star

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:84%
into the awareness
of the body, I

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
want to bring that
beautiful golden light,

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
the celestial light
into the body,

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and when we exhale
out of the mouth,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
we're going to exhale a
color of gray mist out

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of the mouth, which represents
the old you, old thoughts,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:90%
old energy, old belief systems.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Any negativity.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Anything fears you might
still be holding onto

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and that are
programmed within you,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to let that
go with each exhalation.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So together let's bring
that beautiful golden light

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
into the top of the head and
bathe our entire beingness

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:90%
with that light.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And together and inhale.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:90%
[INHALING]

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:90%
And hold it 2, 3, 4, and exhale.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALING]

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Let go.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.039 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Let out the old.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.456 align:middle line:84%
And again, bring that beautiful
golden light and inhale.

00:15:39.456 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:90%
[INHALING]

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And holding it 2,
3, 4, and exhale.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALING]

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.012 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:15:49.012 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.065 align:middle line:90%
Let it go one more time.

00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And inhale that
beautiful golden light.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:90%
[INHALING]

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.314 align:middle line:90%
And hold it 2, 3, 4, and exhale.

00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALING]

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And all the old stagnant
energy has left the body.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Left the body.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And now at this moment,
feeling refreshed, rejuvenated,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
really connected to
heaven, to Earth.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of this
beautiful heart.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And out of your heart
center, project a green light

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:90%
This beautiful green light.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Project it in front of you.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
This green light is
light of healing.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.615 align:middle line:90%
The light of balance.

00:16:44.615 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
The light of peace.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, dear friends,
surround yourself,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the top of your head to
the bottom of your feet,

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
in that green light.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful of how you
feel as you surround yourself

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
in that green light
of healing, of peace.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
When we direct that to
ourselves feel that oneness.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Feel your connectedness.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Feel the joy.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:90%
This is love.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Love by its true nature is
not to keep, but to share.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So please send that
green light to the person

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.146 align:middle line:90%
on your right side.

00:17:27.146 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
For those at home,
people that you know

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.840 align:middle line:84%
would like to have this green
loving light, send it to them.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And soon the entire
room is filled

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:84%
with this oneness
of loving light.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.510 align:middle line:84%
We sit together in peace
and love and harmony.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And we ask, divine
heavenly parent,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
we ask your blessing on
this meeting tonight.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to me.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends,
speak clear to me.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Give us glimpses of
eternity, and let

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.590 align:middle line:90%
us know that you are free.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Give us names and
facts and places.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Help us to understand
heaven's graces.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Send your thoughts upon me
with emotion and simplicity

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
as we sit together in
peace, love, and harmony.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.730 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Good job at home.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Very good job.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And just for a second because
we get so busy with thinking,

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
just acknowledge and
assess how you feel.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.902 align:middle line:90%
You look a lot lighter.

00:18:44.902 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:90%
You look a lot lighter.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel it?

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.563 align:middle line:90%
A little feel differently?

00:18:47.563 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Feel differently there?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it's something,
which we rarely do.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Take the time out to be with
ourselves because we're so

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.335 align:middle line:84%
in our heads that
we think and worry

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and we put all that
stuff out there.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, the body will
respond to our thoughts.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.724 align:middle line:84%
It responds to
exactly what we're

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.926 align:middle line:84%
thinking because
thoughts are real.

00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I've got
to tell you that.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.424 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start now and
do connection with spirit

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.923 align:middle line:84%
because they're all around
us and I would like to begin.

00:19:12.923 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:90%
So let me just see.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.120 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.286 align:middle line:90%
I-- yup-- slow down.

00:19:19.286 --> 00:19:21.202 align:middle line:84%
So I have several people
here and some of them

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:90%
are coming at once.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:90%
So let her go behind me.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:24.973 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:24.973 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.025 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:29.025 --> 00:19:30.749 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:19:30.749 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady here who
comes in very much--

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lady behind
me who's a young woman

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and then there's an
older woman right now.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I want to
say it's a mother figure.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And I feel much older here.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And I feel before
I pass over, I'm

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
not able to-- I'm
not ambulatory.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.735 align:middle line:90%
I'm not able to get around.

00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I feel also there might have
been a little bit of upset

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:84%
or an argument before
this person passes over.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to say that.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that would
be the daughter who

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.085 align:middle line:84%
would be in this room here
because she comes and gives me

00:19:57.085 --> 00:19:57.584 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:19:57.584 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I know also that you must
have a table of mine.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Must have a table or some
furniture of mine in the house.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
here or not, but I just

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
want to get more
information from this lady.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.534 align:middle line:84%
I know there would also be
either furniture or some

00:20:08.534 --> 00:20:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of my belongs in either a
garage or a storage area,

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and I would very much be
aware as this lady makes me,

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.789 align:middle line:84%
impresses me with this, that
recently the daughter would

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:84%
have thought about
going through that stuff

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.246 align:middle line:90%
or had been through that stuff.

00:20:20.246 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Does that makes sense
to somebody here?

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Is this for you?

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mother.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:90%
So your mom's passed over.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.985 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, good.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.307 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
get you a microphone.

00:20:28.307 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I have a lady here
next to you who's your mother,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.015 align:middle line:84%
but I also have
another gentleman

00:20:32.015 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:90%
coming in here as well.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know this man would be
connected with your mother

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.464 align:middle line:84%
so it would be her
father I feel like.

00:20:36.464 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to also talk to
you about was there somebody

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
who had some ties toward
Europe, that came from Europe,

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
or would have been toward
Germany two generations back

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would her
family have been from that?

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
feel like I'm going back

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to that European era, like
Germany kind of thing.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm also telling you
that I have a man here

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that's been over
there for a long time.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.563 align:middle line:90%
He's been over there for awhile.

00:20:56.563 --> 00:20:58.754 align:middle line:84%
And I know this man would
wear glasses at one point.

00:20:58.754 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And I see him very strongly.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.545 align:middle line:84%
I know he's connected
with your mother.

00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm also going to
tell you that he

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
comes in right
next to your mother

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:90%
so he takes care of your mother.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:05.635 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:90%
He takes care of your mother.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell you that,
is there a brother you have?

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a brother who's
still living on the Earth?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh huh.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:12.918 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:21:12.918 --> 00:21:15.006 align:middle line:84%
Because I know as your mom
comes close to me here,

00:21:15.006 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
she's talking to me
about your brother.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.921 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's got
to be a connection with you

00:21:18.921 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and your brother in that I know
that you either have to connect

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
with him again or
there's something

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
which I'm not sure we're
not together on something,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:84%
but I really want to
come together with him.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.205 align:middle line:90%
Now, is he married please?

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's not married.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Was that an issue or something?

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.005 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:33.005 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mhm.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.232 align:middle line:84%
Because mom is standing
right next to me

00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and she's talking about his
marriage or him getting married

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.147 align:middle line:84%
and there's an issue behind
that situation that she goes

00:21:40.147 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:90%
you would know about that.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.298 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
tell you there's

00:21:43.298 --> 00:21:46.497 align:middle line:84%
something about going to either
a paramedic or an ambulance.

00:21:46.497 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
someone came to the house

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:84%
at one point for her,
at the end, toward 911.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.760 align:middle line:90%
We had a call.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Because as she
comes close to me,

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's a
rush of paramedics people

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
around me and rushing
me to the hospital.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.057 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell
you that before when

00:22:02.057 --> 00:22:04.098 align:middle line:84%
your mother's passing--
and I'm going to tell you

00:22:04.098 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
there's a process of passing
with her-- because I know

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.854 align:middle line:84%
two days before you
knew she was gonna pass.

00:22:09.854 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two
days before, she said,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.770 align:middle line:90%
you knew she was going to pass.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You did.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.576 align:middle line:84%
I know it because
she's going, she knew.

00:22:17.576 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:90%
She knew two days before.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she knew
someone with the name of Lucy

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
or Lucille or this name would
be familiar to her family,

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:84%
but I want to go with
that name Lucy or Lucille.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Would you know of anything
with her family or that name

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:90%
would mean anything, L, to you?

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
an Aunt Louise.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Aunt Louise.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.459 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:35.459 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Is she still living on the
Earth or has she passed?

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yup, she's here.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you know
if recently she talked to you?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:90%
She called you, didn't she?

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just being
acknowledged by your mother

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:84%
that she was responsible
for Louise coming through

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And that might sound very
strange or very weird,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.375 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to know your
mother was behind that.

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling
that you even thought

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.945 align:middle line:84%
of her when Louise
talked to you.

00:22:54.945 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:90%
You thought of your mother.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I did.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.508 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:22:57.508 --> 00:22:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me
also that you actually

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:84%
had a thought about your mom
as you're speaking to Louise

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and you and Louise were probably
talking about your mother

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:84%
or said something
about her, correct?

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.774 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
that she brings me now,

00:23:07.774 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
your mom is bringing
me to the summer time.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:90%
To the summer time.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:90%
So I want to go May, June, July.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:13.155 align:middle line:90%
Around this time.

00:23:13.155 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
what significance

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.446 align:middle line:90%
there is in that time.

00:23:15.446 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:84%
If there's a birthday
or is it her birthday

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.552 align:middle line:90%
at that time or your birthday?

00:23:19.552 --> 00:23:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Both.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Both, great.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to go to
that time of the year.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said that's
what makes us happy.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know that we would
celebrate sometimes together,

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.504 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't we?

00:23:27.504 --> 00:23:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mhm.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.491 align:middle line:84%
Because I know we would
celebrate together.

00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And she's holding up a
drink and like a cheers.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Cheers type of thing.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Now you'd say, well, she
didn't drink that much,

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to tell you for
this, she is for some reason

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.350 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm also shown a cross.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a cross here.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.375 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know who was raised
in a Christian or Catholic

00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:47.833 align:middle line:84%
or something to
this Christian way.

00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand about this?

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh huh.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.876 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
she have known

00:23:50.876 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:84%
about that religious background
please or growing up that way?

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.137 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:54.137 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Would you also be very
familiar with her--

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
she's showing me a cross.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So the cross now is
becoming a necklace

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:90%
and I'm putting this on.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:90%
Did she have one do you know?

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.835 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:03.585 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mhm.

00:24:03.585 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Because she keeps on
telling me she did.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.339 align:middle line:84%
So who's the man that's
passed over before her?

00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your dad.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Your dad.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:11.264 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:24:11.264 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So she's met your
father before-- she

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
met your dad when she
first passed over.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.015 align:middle line:90%
Can I say that to you?

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:19.890 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to stay alive.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
stay in that place.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Your mother did not want
to stay away in that place,

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:90%
do you understand that?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE:Nuh-uh.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she said
it was a blessing for her

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:90%
that she moved on.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.836 align:middle line:84%
Now I know she tells me that
beforehand-- and probably

00:24:32.836 --> 00:24:34.420 align:middle line:84%
about a year, year
and a half-- she

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.500 align:middle line:90%
would have been in a hospital.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So that would have been
about a year and a half,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
18 months before she said,
I was in that hospital.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.265 align:middle line:90%
I hated it.

00:24:42.265 --> 00:24:42.765 align:middle line:90%
I hated it.

00:24:42.765 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she's also someone

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.920 align:middle line:84%
who does feel like
she needs control.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.785 align:middle line:84%
She needs to be aware
of her surroundings.

00:24:48.785 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And at that point when she
was in the hospital, she said,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.682 align:middle line:90%
she didn't know where she was.

00:24:52.682 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you remember that?

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.428 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:24:55.428 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
So I know that you're there.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to go
toward-- go on, go on.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.800 align:middle line:84%
She's very interesting how she's
speaking to me because she's

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.174 align:middle line:84%
talking about my daughter
likes to look through books.

00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
She says you love to
look through books.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
like to read and you're

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
reading different books,
but she's also telling me

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.454 align:middle line:84%
that you were looking through
a photo book or picture books.

00:25:14.454 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So she's just acknowledging
you were looking

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.640 align:middle line:84%
through those picture
books just recently.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.781 align:middle line:84%
And I know when your
father comes in here,

00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:24.155 align:middle line:84%
he's a much lighter person in
some ways than your mother.

00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:90%
Can I just say that to you?

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.978 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I feel like I

00:25:26.978 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
want to be lighter
in my mannerisms.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to be lighter in
my energy with your dad.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.297 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like with your
mother as she comes in here,

00:25:33.297 --> 00:25:35.255 align:middle line:84%
there was some hard stuff
when she was younger.

00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When
she was growing up,

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
it was a hard thing
for her to grow up.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.976 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When her
family as a young girl,

00:25:40.976 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
she had a tough time.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:84%
She had to be the adult
when she was a young child,

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.505 align:middle line:90%
and that was hard for her.

00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:48.309 align:middle line:84%
I think she must have been one
of three people in that family.

00:25:48.309 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
She must have had
two other siblings.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.250 align:middle line:90%
One of three?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:55.282 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She has four
sisters and a brother.

00:25:55.282 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Four
sisters and a brother.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.465 align:middle line:84%
And they're still
all alive, huh?

00:25:58.465 --> 00:25:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.179 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So why would there
still be three?

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
She keeps on
talking about three.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
one of them died.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
so three living?

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.565 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.901 align:middle line:84%
Because I know she
says three to me.

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So she's been watching
them and seeing them.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.181 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:26:12.181 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
And the brother is still living?

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:14.746 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does he
have trouble with his eye?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's had
trouble with his eye.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Mm, hm.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.416 align:middle line:84%
So we know there's a cataract
or there's trouble with his eye.

00:26:22.416 --> 00:26:22.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:90%
He just had that fixed.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just
had the surgery.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:90%
She's telling me that.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.716 align:middle line:84%
So there's a problem with
that surgery with the eye.

00:26:28.716 --> 00:26:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he is
getting a bit of emotional

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and he's questioning himself
about living here and not

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:90%
living.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Questioning life and death.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.190 align:middle line:90%
And he's doing that right now.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.648 align:middle line:84%
When you were a young girl,
were there braces or were there

00:26:40.648 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:90%
problems with teeth?

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um--

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.421 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who had the
trouble with the teeth.

00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:49.344 align:middle line:84%
They had to put a retainer
or something on the teeth.

00:26:49.344 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My sister.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.316 align:middle line:90%
I had to have a retainer.

00:26:51.316 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.092 align:middle line:84%
At seven years of age,
there was a retainer.

00:26:55.092 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she said there's

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.070 align:middle line:84%
a picture of you at
seven years of age.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.730 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
photograph of you.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.791 align:middle line:84%
You had maybe a school
photograph you had taken

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't want to go
that day to school she said.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's giving me.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:90%
But you're very beautiful.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:90%
You're very beautiful.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.994 align:middle line:84%
You don't see it, but
you're very beautiful.

00:27:10.994 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
hardest part of my job

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:90%
is not talking to spirit.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.086 align:middle line:84%
But the hardest part is
seeing your own beauty

00:27:18.086 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and your own gifts and you
don't see it for yourself.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that your mother is
asking for forgiveness here.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.640 align:middle line:84%
She's asking for
forgiveness, OK?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you tried to
get your mother's love really,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:84%
really a lot, and
you couldn't get her

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:90%
the way you wanted her to be.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that you wanted
your mom's love.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I know you wanted
it a certain way.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.410 align:middle line:90%
And I can't get what I want.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I want her to
receive me in a certain way.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I want her to be
sensitive to my--

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to looking at things
the way they really

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.354 align:middle line:84%
are instead of how
she perceives things.

00:27:50.354 --> 00:27:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:51.728 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:27:51.728 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:90%
So she's apologizing for that.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:90%
She's apologizing for that.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.396 align:middle line:90%
Are you married?

00:27:56.396 --> 00:27:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any children
or married at all?

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a widow.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're a widow.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So you've been thinking
about your husband?

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that I'm pretty
good at what I do and it flows

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.328 align:middle line:84%
through but if you think
about one particular person,

00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:11.282 align:middle line:84%
you're using all that
energy in that space

00:28:11.282 --> 00:28:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and you're blocking it.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like a hose that
you're watering the garden

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.127 align:middle line:84%
and you put a crink in the
hose, the water can't flow.

00:28:17.127 --> 00:28:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you think about
a particular person,

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.835 align:middle line:84%
you're blocking everyone
else from coming in.

00:28:20.835 --> 00:28:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And your mom needs
the healing from you.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.631 align:middle line:90%
This is your mom's time.

00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
She needs to come through
and say she's sorry for you.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said she knows that
you didn't think she heard you.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.261 align:middle line:90%
She knows that.

00:28:33.261 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're angry
with me at certain times.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.880 align:middle line:90%
You were angry with her.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.687 align:middle line:84%
And I know that--
also by the way,

00:28:38.687 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
there's someone of the name
Charles in the spirit world.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know who
Charles is, but there's

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:90%
a Charles in the spirit.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.514 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So in
the family there ago.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So they want to
say hello to you.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And they can bring through
your husband in a different way

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
so let me just put
that aside, right?

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But I know I need for
your mom to come through

00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and she said she knows now
that she didn't hear you

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.484 align:middle line:90%
when she was living, OK?

00:29:01.484 --> 00:29:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that-- I'm not sure

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:84%
if there was an event
with your husband

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that she missed or she
missed an anniversary

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
or there was a
birthday or she didn't

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:90%
get a card to your or something.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.417 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:13.416 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And I know you are pissed.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:15.958 align:middle line:90%
I was mad at her.

00:29:15.958 --> 00:29:17.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, I know.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I know you were
because I know that.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.008 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very aware of that.

00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm very, very aware of that.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's
very sorry about that.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.085 align:middle line:84%
Your mother has her
own stuff, you know?

00:29:27.085 --> 00:29:27.751 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
you want an ideal family.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.905 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:29:30.905 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Your whole idea as a kid
was I want an ideal family

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't have that
when you were a young girl.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Was there a thought about
teaching at home or you

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.710 align:middle line:84%
thought about being a
teacher at one time?

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Me.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Because she's tell
me that you were

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.630 align:middle line:84%
going to be a teacher
or you thought about it

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.680 align:middle line:90%
that I want to be a teacher.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And that when you
were a young girl,

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:84%
you used to lock yourself
away in your own little room

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.729 align:middle line:90%
and pretend I was a teacher.

00:29:49.729 --> 00:29:50.395 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:50.395 --> 00:29:51.455 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:29:51.455 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
she's telling me.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I did.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
really interesting.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say-- and this
lady-- I really feel sorry

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:90%
for your mother.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I really feel sorry
for your mother

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.203 align:middle line:84%
because I feel when she
was young girl that either

00:30:02.203 --> 00:30:04.800 align:middle line:84%
her father wasn't there for
her, was not there emotionally

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:84%
for her, was not present for
her, and that affected her.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Because your mom's
very sensitive as well.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.778 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:30:10.778 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And I know there
would be an old cuckoo

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.974 align:middle line:84%
clock, an old clock
that you must have.

00:30:15.974 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I feel it
must--you understand that?

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's gone down
through family.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Generations.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.824 align:middle line:90%
It's been handed down from--

00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand?

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.142 align:middle line:90%
So you have that clock, right?

00:30:27.142 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.505 align:middle line:90%
So this is just validations.

00:30:29.505 --> 00:30:31.624 align:middle line:84%
This is just information
that she knows

00:30:31.624 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:90%
and your father knows.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Your father's behind you waving.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.642 align:middle line:90%
Your father is fine.

00:30:35.642 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Your father said
to tell you he has

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.230 align:middle line:84%
a garden on the
other side of life.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.650 align:middle line:90%
And he loves to garden.

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.694 align:middle line:84%
And I know that over
here on this side of life

00:30:42.694 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:84%
he would have liked
a garden here.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
I'm very concerned about roses.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.991 align:middle line:84%
I'm very concerned
about fertilizing.

00:30:48.991 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very concerned
about watering things.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.592 align:middle line:90%
And your dad is like that.

00:30:52.592 --> 00:30:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:55.693 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
also know that you

00:30:55.693 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:84%
would have had a dream
about your father

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.059 align:middle line:84%
not too far back,
not too far back.

00:30:59.059 --> 00:30:59.725 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:30:59.725 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, as I connect
with you and I want to ask you,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.714 align:middle line:90%
your husband passed over?

00:31:03.714 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And was he ill
please for a bit of a time,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:90%
wasn't he?

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because as I
get this energy close to you,

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.392 align:middle line:84%
this gentleman comes
in here and can

00:31:11.392 --> 00:31:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I just tell you you've
opened up the doors now.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Now you've given
your mother her space

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.610 align:middle line:90%
and your father his space.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you,
I love your father.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.160 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:90%
He tells me jokes.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.675 align:middle line:84%
He's very light and
he doesn't take things

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
so seriously like
your mother does.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Your mother's a bit too
serious about things.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.086 align:middle line:84%
But then we must look
about her background.

00:31:29.086 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Where did she come
from, you see?

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.460 align:middle line:90%
What was her upbringing?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.287 align:middle line:90%
What did she learn as a child?

00:31:33.287 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very important.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So I know as this gentleman
comes here, he's very handsome.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:90%
He took care of you.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Your husband took care of you.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.395 align:middle line:90%
I stand up like this.

00:31:41.395 --> 00:31:42.127 align:middle line:90%
I'm very proud.

00:31:42.127 --> 00:31:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes he
could be a little cocky

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:90%
when he wanted to be.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Like really a little arrogant
and cocky when he wanted to be,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.320 align:middle line:90%
but just playing around.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Fun type of thing.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I'm going
to go to the end of August

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:90%
or around August?

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That
was our anniversary.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Anniversary.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And is was the 20s
the anniversary?

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Something in the 20s?

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.091 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:31:58.091 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So was it the 27th or
something like this?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.340 align:middle line:90%
So August 27.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.757 align:middle line:84%
I know that's our time together
and we still have our time

00:32:04.757 --> 00:32:05.256 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:84%
He comes in bringing
you roses, roses, roses

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.092 align:middle line:84%
because you keep on putting
roses next to his photograph.

00:32:10.092 --> 00:32:11.034 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:32:11.034 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because he said you

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
keep on putting roses
next to the photograph,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:90%
so he's telling me about that.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.341 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I see he loves you very,
very strongly this man.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Really, really strongly.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And you haven't lost
his love, darling.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:90%
You haven't lost his love.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's something which
he's part of your soul now.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.459 align:middle line:84%
Now I know the last
memories that you

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
have of this gentleman,
I know that I

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.441 align:middle line:90%
have to be at the hospital, OK?

00:32:31.441 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that I'm in a
special place in this hospital.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:84%
I see him in a bed and
I'm very aware you're

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.514 align:middle line:90%
standing next to him, OK?

00:32:37.514 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.513 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You held his hand.

00:32:39.513 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And he gives me a memory
of you holding his hand.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I know that I
can't breath right.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm in a
lot of pain, this man.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my
body is not my own.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
you put together the video.

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.050 align:middle line:84%
You put together the
video of my life.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:90%
You put together all the video.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's not only video
that he's showing me here.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also seeing
still photographs

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that you put into
the video, correct?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.513 align:middle line:84%
So he's just talking
to me about that.

00:33:03.513 --> 00:33:05.370 align:middle line:84%
You put the still videos
into that as well.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.575 align:middle line:90%
And go, go, go.

00:33:07.575 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I got you.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I like him.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:84%
He has good energy,
your husband.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.310 align:middle line:90%
He calls it what it is.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.417 align:middle line:90%
He's black and white.

00:33:15.417 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:90%
There's no fooling around.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:19.395 align:middle line:84%
He's a little full of himself,
but he takes good care of you.

00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:20.970 align:middle line:90%
You're his princess.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:90%
You're his princess.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.130 align:middle line:90%
He smothers you with love.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say he must have been
a little bit taller than you.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Would that make sense?

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
if I want to do this.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to kiss your head,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Because he kisses your
head all the time.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:90%
All the time kisses your head.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.028 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:33:33.028 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a John
connection somewhere.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know there's a friend
of his with the name John,

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:90%
but he's talking about a John.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.090 align:middle line:90%
He's looking our for John.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I got
to tell you that.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk
about having this car.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:44.706 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:44.706 --> 00:33:45.895 align:middle line:90%
Do you still have the car?

00:33:45.895 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But that was
a big deal with that car.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it was.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.003 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And not
getting rid of the car

00:33:51.003 --> 00:33:52.694 align:middle line:84%
or what to do with
that car, right?

00:33:52.694 --> 00:33:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.859 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
he's very, very aware of that.

00:33:55.859 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And he loves the energy
of you doing that, helping

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:90%
him that way.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Having that thought about
I got to keep his car.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.203 align:middle line:84%
Now I know you have his
dresser there too because he

00:34:05.203 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:90%
shows me the dresser.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:06.945 align:middle line:90%
The dresser.

00:34:06.945 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's his dresser.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.278 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going back to the time
right before he passes away,

00:34:10.278 --> 00:34:11.464 align:middle line:90%
he has a dresser there, OK?

00:34:11.464 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that I want

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:15.489 align:middle line:84%
to-- there are little
things on the top of it too.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:16.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very strange.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.586 align:middle line:90%
Little things on top of it.

00:34:17.586 --> 00:34:19.668 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
something like a bobble head,

00:34:19.668 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:90%
one of them, back at that time.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Not presently.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.502 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:23.502 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:90%
And did he like football?

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:26.386 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:26.386 --> 00:34:28.552 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because what
I'm seeing in front of me

00:34:28.552 --> 00:34:30.600 align:middle line:84%
on top of this dresser
it looks almost

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.598 align:middle line:84%
like a bobble head of a football
player, a football helmet.

00:34:33.598 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:35.699 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:36.699 align:middle line:90%
It's the weirdest thing.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:40.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the weirdest thing, but
he gives me that-- he's goofy,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:84%
he's fun, and he's goofy,
but, you know what, he's real.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:90%
He's real.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.120 align:middle line:90%
I want you to look for a Mark.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of a Mark.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me Mark and
he's telling me skiing.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.731 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
that this gentleman's talking

00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:56.190 align:middle line:84%
about setting you up or putting
you together with somebody else

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.710 align:middle line:90%
and you will-- it happens.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The best matchmakers are
in heaven, let me tell you.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.034 align:middle line:84%
So your husband is going to
help you find somebody else.

00:35:05.034 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're going to
say, I don't want anybody else.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just happened.

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't want this,
I'm still in grief.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to go
through the grief.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
this process of it.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.141 align:middle line:84%
But just don't forget that
he's looking out for you.

00:35:16.141 --> 00:35:17.765 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
name Mark and skiing.

00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:19.834 align:middle line:84%
It's very specific so
would you remember that?

00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now do you
still have the roses, then,

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that you keep on putting
next to the photograph,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.796 align:middle line:90%
or do you have a rose?

00:35:24.796 --> 00:35:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And now he's also telling me
that when he passes away--

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.039 align:middle line:84%
and I know it must
have been in a hospital

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very, very aware
that I don't see things

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
so I'm in this coma before I
pass over or I'm out of it.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, no hospital.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No hospital.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Was there a hospice
or was he at home?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was hospice.

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wasn't he in the
hospital right before that?

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
what he's showing me.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Because I know what I'm seeing.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm seeing a hospital.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.848 align:middle line:90%
I see a hospital.

00:35:46.848 --> 00:35:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware of it
because I'm lying in the bed

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
and I have a door over here and
I have a nurse's station close

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.970 align:middle line:90%
by.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: See?

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:53.643 align:middle line:90%
So ding, ding, ding.

00:35:53.643 --> 00:35:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's very aware of
the sounds at nighttime.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:90%
I know that I'm in pain.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.590 align:middle line:90%
I know that he's in pain.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It must be some kind
of a cancerous thing.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:90%
It has to be.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
it's just like my body

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.551 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel like my own.

00:36:04.551 --> 00:36:05.522 align:middle line:90%
I know I need oxygen.

00:36:05.522 --> 00:36:07.230 align:middle line:84%
I know my food-- I
didn't eat for awhile.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I know I get really thin.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you,
I can't even eat food.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:12.780 align:middle line:90%
It tastes terrible to me.

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know that-- I want to
tell you that I'm at a lake

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:90%
or I'm near a lake.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you that
the lake means a lot, OK?

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.126 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:19.126 --> 00:36:21.065 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
if we go to this cabin

00:36:21.065 --> 00:36:22.190 align:middle line:90%
and we have our lake there.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting in
front of the lake.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.609 align:middle line:84%
And I know if I tell you
that, you'll understand that.

00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.735 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
he's telling me

00:36:27.735 --> 00:36:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that you'll understand he's in
heaven if he says that to you.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.905 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did he like
fishing every once in awhile,

00:36:32.905 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:90%
didn't he?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.066 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I know there

00:36:35.066 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
would be a photograph
of me with fishing.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if we have
fishing poles in there.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.580 align:middle line:84%
You still have a
fishing rod of his?

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.558 align:middle line:84%
And I know that would
be very significant

00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:47.650 align:middle line:84%
that you'd have the
fishing rod, OK?

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's a photograph
of him, the fishing photograph.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.288 align:middle line:84%
There could be
several, but there's

00:36:52.288 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
one significant that
you still have out, OK?

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.166 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know very, very much

00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that when he passes
over he said that you

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:84%
went to his side of the
bed or you moved over

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.780 align:middle line:90%
to that side of the bed.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Understand that?

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.335 align:middle line:84%
So it's just validation
that you did that with him.

00:37:06.335 --> 00:37:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And he's just talking
to me about that.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:90%
So what else?

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:90%
So he's always with you.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.146 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're reading
to him and you talk to him

00:37:14.146 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:90%
in the TV room.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:84%
There's two living rooms-- a
living room, a sitting room,

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and a TV room.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.715 align:middle line:90%
Two separate rooms, correct?

00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's right
there in that chair next to you

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:21.787 align:middle line:90%
still in that space.

00:37:21.787 --> 00:37:22.870 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Still in that space.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.625 align:middle line:84%
And I know you petting
his hair when he was ill.

00:37:26.625 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And he said his hair is fine.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.365 align:middle line:90%
He has a full head of hair.

00:37:29.365 --> 00:37:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Full head of hair.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And he's very happy about it.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And he wants you to know
that he's all right.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going
to leave you with that.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:37.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, sweetheart?

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.716 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:38.716 --> 00:37:39.447 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:37:39.447 --> 00:37:39.884 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Blessings.

00:37:39.884 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Blessings.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
very, very welcome.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.520 align:middle line:84%
So as I stand here
it's so interesting

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:84%
because as I'm standing here,
I get hit left and right.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I put
myself in this space

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.181 align:middle line:84%
I will be influenced
by certain spirits.

00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And many people in
the audience want

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.200 align:middle line:84%
to hear from one
particular person,

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.283 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it blocks
the others from coming in.

00:37:57.283 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So I just go to
what I'm hearing.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So I have another gentleman
that comes in here.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.812 align:middle line:84%
And he's coming in with
a woman by the way.

00:38:02.812 --> 00:38:04.645 align:middle line:84%
So there's a woman that
he would know about.

00:38:04.645 --> 00:38:06.802 align:middle line:84%
So his mother would have
been on the spirit side

00:38:06.802 --> 00:38:08.660 align:middle line:84%
or in the spirit
side of life, OK?

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
that this man dies younger

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:90%
than older, OK?

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, this man
dies younger than older.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the man I have
here, would you

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.870 align:middle line:84%
understand about this
man not really, can I

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.420 align:middle line:84%
say, supporting his body,
supporting who he was,

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:23.380 align:middle line:84%
had no sense of himself,
this sort of thing.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:24.488 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:24.488 --> 00:38:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I also got to tell
you that I was angry.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.427 align:middle line:84%
So this man is angry when
he leaves or he's angry.

00:38:29.427 --> 00:38:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.887 align:middle line:90%
I know you dad passed over.

00:38:31.887 --> 00:38:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I know you love your
father, but your father

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.610 align:middle line:90%
comes through all the time.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you
your father must have been

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.080 align:middle line:84%
in the military at
one point, wasn't he?

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.816 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And don't you
have a photograph of him

00:38:41.816 --> 00:38:43.200 align:middle line:90%
in his military uniform please?

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, we do.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he's telling me--

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:46.020 align:middle line:84%
he's acknowledging that you
have the photograph of him

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.152 align:middle line:90%
in that military uniform.

00:38:47.152 --> 00:38:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I know there would also
be medals at one point.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if they're dog
tag medals or the dog tags.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:90%
You have that, right?

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, we have that.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So he's just acknowledging
that you have that.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:90%
Did he smoke cigarettes?

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he did.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.625 align:middle line:84%
Because as I connect here,
I'm not only seeing cigarettes

00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:00.640 align:middle line:90%
around you, but I'm--

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.120 align:middle line:90%
[SMOKING SOUND]

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And he is telling me that he
loves a good cigarette, OK?

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you
that he knew somebody

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.520 align:middle line:90%
in that war time name Mac.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:90%
M-A-C. Mac.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.650 align:middle line:90%
M-A-C. Good.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you would
know about having

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:84%
some of your dad's
belongings, correct?

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, we have some.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.596 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I'm
very aware that you

00:39:19.596 --> 00:39:23.290 align:middle line:84%
have a couple of boxes,
but one in particular

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:90%
is a cardboard box.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Now this box looks
a little worn.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very worn, yes.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As if it was
rained upon, it got wet,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of
worn out, right?

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:33.746 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
inside that box he

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.982 align:middle line:84%
shows me that you have
either journals, magazines,

00:39:37.982 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and photographs
that belong to him.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.593 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:39:41.593 --> 00:39:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you please go
home and look at that,

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
a journal in there.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:90%
I know it's handwritten.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.099 align:middle line:90%
And he has a list of people.

00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's his platoon
or people that are in there,

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and if you'll find number
five going down that list,

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.326 align:middle line:84%
it'll say, Mac, or
in parentheses, Mac.

00:39:56.326 --> 00:39:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing it
very, very clearly.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "M-A-C," quote
and another name.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

So please look for that.

Guarantee also
you're going to find

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:84%
toward the back of that
book there's photographs.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Loose photographs in that box.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:09.182 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:09.182 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:90%
That is correct.

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:11.683 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But especially
that one book, the journal,

00:40:11.683 --> 00:40:13.730 align:middle line:84%
there's photographs in
the back of that journal.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, you're right.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are
you aware of that?

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's a
team or a platoon of his guys

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.704 align:middle line:84%
that he was with
in that war and I

00:40:20.704 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
know it's right
near that journal,

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.782 align:middle line:84%
and it's a black and
white photograph.

00:40:23.782 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you would see that.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
he's with all those people.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And more.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.090 align:middle line:90%
It showed up in a dream.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
showed up in a dream?

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Oh, fantastic.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.425 align:middle line:84%
He has his voice
back he's telling me.

00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I don't
know what that means.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.929 align:middle line:90%
He has his voice back.

00:40:38.929 --> 00:40:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He had pulmonary
fibrosis at the end.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
he couldn't speak?

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was
on a lot of oxygen.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
he couldn't speak

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.803 align:middle line:90%
at the end, is that right?

00:40:44.803 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to
know he is around you

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and he has his voice back
and I've got to tell you,

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:53.796 align:middle line:84%
he's also helping
the people around

00:40:53.796 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
worried about so much.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.169 align:middle line:90%
Why do you worry so much?

00:40:57.169 --> 00:40:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Human nature.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.335 align:middle line:90%

OK.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that, OK?

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.
