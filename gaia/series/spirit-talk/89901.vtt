00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: And now, world
renowned spirit medium James

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Van Praagh.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.204 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone!

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Hi, thank you!

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, and
thank you, and also

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
thank you for coming together at
"Spirit Talk" where I take you

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.850 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And today's topic I find
very, very interesting.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It is one which we've
all probably heard of.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:90%
We maybe even used the term.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about and we think
we know the meaning of it.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And I thought today we would
discuss it even further

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.716 align:middle line:84%
to go forward to really
more understanding it more.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And the term I'm
going to use is karma.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
use the term karma?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.144 align:middle line:90%
And what do you think it means?

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably pick-- Just,
what are your concept of karma?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Anybody want to just share?

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.387 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this lady right here.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A soul debt.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You what?

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A soul debt.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Like a--

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A soul debt--
what do you mean by that?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.176 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Something
you need to repay.

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Something
you need to repay.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.609 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK, a lot of us think that.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.775 align:middle line:90%
Something you need to repay.

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:24.810 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.305 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else over here, perhaps?

00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So I think of
it as coming into balance.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.514 align:middle line:84%
So it could also be
receiving something

00:01:33.514 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:84%
that you have given
away in a past life.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.464 align:middle line:90%
And now it's come back to you.

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
It's all about balance
is how I look at karma.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.146 align:middle line:90%
And this lady up here.

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to piggy back on this woman.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's also
about opportunity

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.822 align:middle line:90%
to relearn something.

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Opportunity
to relearn something.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's good.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.297 align:middle line:84%
I like all three of
those definitions.

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:90%
I think they're all right.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:84%
All three of those,
I feel, are right.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else have any other
insights into something?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm-- wait.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I also
think atonement.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
think atonement?

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.661 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.145 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Sort of like the
idea of paying things back.

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Paying
things back as we said--

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So
karma and atonement

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:90%
is what comes up for me.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When
I hear atonement,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I think of religious
connotation, yeah?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.206 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm
thinking sort of like--

00:02:18.206 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --sure.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.455 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --with
the balancing.

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you take something,
giving it back.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've hurt somebody,
making up for that.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Balancing things out,
making them even.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.265 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I like all of those definitions,
and I think they're all right.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I think they're all accurate.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
I think that so many people
out there over the years

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
have used the term
karma erroneously.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
just jump into saying,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's bad karma.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard, oh,
that's bad karma, or that's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:84%
good karma based upon
maybe what you said,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.463 align:middle line:84%
what you did to somebody,
or-- oh, guys, they're

00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:55.250 align:middle line:90%
going to get bad karma.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that
karma hit my dogma.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.928 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:01.171 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:90%
I put that in one of my books.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a little levity.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So-- in traditions back east,
of course, dogma-- dogma

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
means positive things.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Positive you give
out, you get back.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's all correct.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I am someone who
likes to be very, very

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
simple about my
definitions and my truth.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And I base it upon my
communication with the spirit

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:90%
world for 40 years or 30 years.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting older
before the seconds.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:90%
30 years.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:90%
But it's really interesting.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.233 align:middle line:84%
Because I think we should
just bring it all the way down

00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to all those definitions and the
simple fact that it's energy.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And we as God beings, God
light, this light of God,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.595 align:middle line:84%
is constantly creating--
creating, creating, creating.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that creating, whether
we're conscious of creating

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
or unconscious of
creating, we are

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:90%
consecrating-- being God light.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
So we create with energy.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you think--
thoughts have power.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts have energy.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Words, of course, have power.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.715 align:middle line:90%
Feelings, emotions, power.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And actions which you do
for another individual

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:84%
or for yourself, by the way--
I just-- I want everyone

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to realize that karma is
really-- you are karma.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
You are-- it's
how you have-- how

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
you act, how you behave, what
you give out, what you create.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it is to me.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I always say how people
treat you is their karma.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.379 align:middle line:90%
How you react is yours.

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So what are you going to
do with the energy which

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
you have given out?

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
do with that energy?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to, as
God, create that energy

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and bring that out
into the world?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
That's really, really
important, I think.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And once we have that
concept of karma,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.932 align:middle line:84%
or if I could just say being
mindful with energy-- what

00:04:44.932 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
you're giving out, what
you're creating, I think then

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
if we can start living
that way, that we're

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
responsible for everything
that we give out,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:84%
anyone we meet on
our path that day

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in an elevator,
whether it's at a coffee shop,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
there's karmic--
there's energy being

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:90%
transferred back and forth.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to you as
this responsible God being

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.875 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that it's the
best possible energy you

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
can give out.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why we're here.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I think that's why we're here.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.525 align:middle line:84%
Anybody have certain things
that, in their lifetime,

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
you find that you
have situations

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
in your life, scenarios in your
life that you have bad karma?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So we say I have bad
karma, or bad things

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:90%
happen, or stuff like that.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:90%
You never can catch a break.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.225 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody always
have that experience?

00:05:29.225 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Right over here,
what's your name?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Erin

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Erin.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.269 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to come up on stage
and we'll just work with you

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.810 align:middle line:90%
a little bit?

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.938 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:05:35.938 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
I won't bite you.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I promise.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the bridge.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.689 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
add-- to ask you,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.521 align:middle line:84%
because you said that, you
know, we talked about karma.

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And just tell us
why you think you

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
might have had some bad
things or what has happened.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
If you are-- whatever
you want to share.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I mean--

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just want to
look at things differently.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good and bad stuff.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's not all crap.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.932 align:middle line:84%
But, well, the
relationship gig of it.

00:05:57.932 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let's go there.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.931 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Stinks.

00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let's go there.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.628 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Constantly.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I just want
to say to you, as we talk

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.881 align:middle line:84%
about karma and we talk about
energy, what we give out

00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
and what we receive
back, I want everybody

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to realize that karma
is really-- it's energy.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's also-- we have to
realize that this is indeed

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:90%
our school room down here.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And as souls, we come back here
to learn many, many experiences

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and situations.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, if we could
put a label of karma,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.945 align:middle line:90%
whatever, that's fine.

00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:26.861 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to just
work with you to see--

00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and no judgment here--
complete, absolute--

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
it's just really assessing
it and observing it.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's just-- I
just want maybe we

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:84%
can see it a different way
or let's see what's going on.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.824 align:middle line:90%
So go on.

00:06:35.824 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:84%
What was the first
thing that you feel--

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh boy.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --relationships.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're helping
probably a lot

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.470 align:middle line:90%
of people watching this, too.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So why you feel you had
bad karma or bad things?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Or what was it?

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, I feel
that I'm constantly

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.872 align:middle line:84%
giving in the relationship
and not receiving.

00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
your whole life,

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
was that a pattern
your soul's had?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Friends, relationships, yeah.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.491 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
why do you do that?

00:06:59.491 --> 00:06:59.814 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
I'm a caretaker.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I like-- it makes me
feel good about myself

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.492 align:middle line:90%
to care and to give.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.283 align:middle line:90%
Hold it right there.

00:07:08.283 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
How many here in the
audience feel the exact way?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Caretakers, giving.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot of us.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So-- and sometimes, we might
have unrealized expectations

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.551 align:middle line:90%
of others.

00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.485 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:21.645 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --may be right.

00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:22.145 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:22.145 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So if we say that,
you know what, I give.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving freely.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving to
help, to heal them.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's good
karma for me, right?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.012 align:middle line:84%
And we sometimes expect that
same level of receptivity.

00:07:34.012 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.524 align:middle line:90%


00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.231 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of us do.

00:07:37.231 --> 00:07:38.015 align:middle line:90%
A lot of us do.

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been
through this one.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:90%
I've been through this lesson.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.239 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm still going
through it a little bit.

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I think I've maybe
conquered it past two years.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But I had to get
to the realization

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
that you have to give freely.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to give the free energy
freely, and whatever comes

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
back comes back-- if
it does come back.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But you're not doing it
to receive anything back.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.768 align:middle line:84%
So, so, so, when we give
freely as a caretaker,

00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:04.185 align:middle line:84%
we just have to give because
that's the right thing to do.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.892 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to look
at it a little bit

00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:06.897 align:middle line:90%
differently that way.

00:08:06.897 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I think also
we get caught up sometimes

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
in that we give away--
we really-- we mix it up.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we think, if I'm
giving and doing that,

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:90%
it shows I love them.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can love somebody
without having to do that,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can give--
create options for them,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.730 align:middle line:84%
create scenarios for them
to be the best they can be,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:84%
create that space for them
in their life in some way

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.027 align:middle line:84%
where you don't have to feel
like I'm always giving, giving,

00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:34.527 align:middle line:90%
giving.

00:08:34.527 --> 00:08:35.246 align:middle line:90%
Just create that.

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:36.370 align:middle line:90%
You understand what I mean?

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:36.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:38.205 align:middle line:90%
OK, what about another.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And everybody can relate
to that, I'm sure,

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.198 align:middle line:90%
that's listening.

00:08:40.198 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a
very common lesson

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that we go through overgiving,
especially healers, by the way.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Especially empathetic
people, givers, like that.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's got
to be boundaries.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be-- we
have to honor ourselves

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.225 align:middle line:84%
enough to have
boundaries with that.

00:08:53.225 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
karma with family?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, uh-huh.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
tell us about it.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.275 align:middle line:90%
We wanna know.

00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.675 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.675 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How many
people in your family?

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:90%
How many siblings?

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have two sisters.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two sisters.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.356 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's your karma
with both of them?

00:09:05.356 --> 00:09:08.104 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.104 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ooh, gosh.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, once again, it's sort
of the same role being played.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm the caretaker.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that's a
role that you can relate to.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Always taking care of them.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so maybe-- now, some
people think karma and being

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.654 align:middle line:84%
in that role, that role
playing, that in this lifetime,

00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I have to go back and
take care of them.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:90%
And that could be my karma.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.529 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can agree with that too
in that, in several past lives

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.195 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, you might
have been in the role

00:09:33.195 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
where you had to receive
and you didn't give out.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And now you have to
be the one to do that.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.247 align:middle line:84%
So that could be also karma,
energy, action from the past.

00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:90%
Remember, there's a natural law.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Of every action,
there's a reaction.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.993 align:middle line:84%
And so an action in a past
incarnation could be you

00:09:48.993 --> 00:09:51.534 align:middle line:84%
were in the role of like always
having to be there receiving,

00:09:51.534 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
receiving, receiving,
and not giving.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And now you've come back into
a situation with other souls

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're playing
out your roles

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:90%
as we do when we come back here.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And you're-- that-- does it
feel right to you, by the way,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.830 align:middle line:90%
in that role?

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that feel natural to you?

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Does it feel not right?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, it
feels-- it feels right.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:90%
I like giving.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just I-- it
would be nice to--

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Receive

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.007 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --receive and to
have some sincere gratitude.

00:10:18.007 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.131 align:middle line:90%
And what would that do for you?

00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.006 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It would
confirm myself.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:24.755 align:middle line:90%
It would confirm--

00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:26.921 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So do you
need them to make you feel--

00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I do
not-- I need-- yeah.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:90%
I do not.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
do not need that.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Because you could
have gratitude,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and you could have a really
positive, good sense of you

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:84%
just gave freely from the
heart unconditionally.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.260 align:middle line:84%
If we could all love
unconditionally, gosh,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't we be
happier people, right?

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
But when we start putting
conditions on our love,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:90%
then we get screwed up.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm just--
I'm being helpful here.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.745 align:middle line:84%
Because all of us are
benefiting from this.

00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's really,
really important

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:90%
that no conditions on that.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It would be really
nice to receive.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But I think if we put
it out unconditionally,

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
we will receive back in many
other ways, and actually

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:90%
much better ways, too.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And it comes back to you.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So again, if you can be
clean with sending out

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that love, if you can be
clean with your actions,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
helping another person, really
assisting them, nurturing them

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
unconditionally because
that's who you are,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
then I think you'd receive
back, because that's

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.639 align:middle line:90%
what the action is.

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you send out
that creative thought,

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
that creative action, then
we're giving that out.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just want it
unconditionally, all right?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:84%
How are your mom
and dad situation?

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.347 align:middle line:90%
What's your karma with them?

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we always have karma or
with energy with their parents

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:90%
now, don't we?

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --our families,
you know, with that.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:90%
We come back.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My father
is physically disabled.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So he, you know, he
requires more assistance

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
than others and a
little bit more--

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
He has isolated himself
a little bit more.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.472 align:middle line:90%
So it's very hard for me to--

00:11:55.472 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right, so
let's stop right there.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:90%
So isn't this interesting?

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:90%
I wonder who takes care of him.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.137 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.137 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you probably
take more care of him

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.669 align:middle line:90%
than the other siblings do.

00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Because that's your role.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.654 align:middle line:90%
That's loving him.

00:12:10.654 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:84%
It's just giving
that love to him.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But that definitely-- that's
that role again you're playing.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.711 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, are you
connecting with his heart?

00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.251 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you're
able to talk to him

00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and then just relate to him
and communicate on that level.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:90%
That's very, very good.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I just always say when
someone is handicapped,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:84%
whether they grow up that
way or they become that way

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:84%
when they're aged, I think
it's a wonderful opportunity

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
for your soul's growth,
for a lesson there.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it gives
an opportunity.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not always sometimes
for the person in that handicap

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:90%
position.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But it really is, many
times, for those around them

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.170 align:middle line:90%
to give unconditionally.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.405 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.405 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it interesting?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like you're
just one step further out.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.283 align:middle line:84%
It makes a big
difference, doesn't it?

00:12:56.283 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's all.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.582 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:12:59.582 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Did you get that?

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How are you
going to change things now?

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I have been
working on and will continue

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.187 align:middle line:84%
to work on appreciating--
appreciating myself and--

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
you're gorgeous.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Acknowledging--
oh, thank you.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You are.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:90%
She is.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:90%
You're gorgeous.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.474 align:middle line:84%
Just acknowledging myself and
not needing that confirmation.

00:13:16.474 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You know,
and I know that I

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:90%
am seeking confirmation a lot.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.157 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't get
that confirmation, I--

00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Feel
bad about yourself?

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:25.448 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:13:25.448 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:90%
And I do know--

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.935 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: See,
you're-- yeah,

00:13:26.935 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
you're programming
yourself like that.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
You're really setting yourself
up then for disappointment.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am, I am.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
face a disappointment.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Because when I open
myself up and just give

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
without the expectation, that's
when I am just so much more

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.226 align:middle line:84%
happy and filled with gratitude
for myself and everything.

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because that's
your natural state of being.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
The human part of us
is a conditioning part.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we have
these conditions.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But the spiritual part
of you, your soul,

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:90%
doesn't need those conditions.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.694 align:middle line:90%
Your soul just is.

00:13:54.694 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:90%
You're just God.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.318 align:middle line:90%
You're just that light.

00:13:56.318 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:90%
You just permeate.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So when we stop putting the
conditions on that light, when

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.985 align:middle line:84%
we stop closing down
that light and try

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to fit that light into boxes,
you'll be a lot happier.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And never look to anybody
else for your happiness.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Got to find it here.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.812 align:middle line:90%
OK, Dorothy.

00:14:10.812 --> 00:14:11.312 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:90%
From "Wizard of Oz"?

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Go right inside.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: "The Wiz," yes.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, sweetheart.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Give her applause,
round of applause.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.335 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:14:18.335 --> 00:14:19.452 align:middle line:90%
You can go back to your seat.

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:20.316 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Give me a hug goodbye.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Was that all right?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
not that bad, uh-huh?

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you very, very much
for stepping up here and doing

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:90%
I know it took courage.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But just by us looking at that--
and, you know, not judging it,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
just observing
it, assessing it--

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.815 align:middle line:84%
I think that helped
everybody that's watching

00:14:34.815 --> 00:14:36.819 align:middle line:84%
and everybody in the
audience that you can just

00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
look at something a
little bit differently.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And the work that
I do-- that we do,

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I should say--
I'm just a vessel,

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.620 align:middle line:84%
but that the spirit world comes
through me and tries to help--

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:84%
is really to have that
awareness of self.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Awareness that you are this
incredible spiritual being,

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and we need nobody else's
approval to be who we are.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
just being who we are

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and what comes out
of us with our love

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and being that, just giving
of yourself, it's hard.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Human world, hard,
difficult, limitations.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people base
their life on fear.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you just be who
you are and emanate that,

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:84%
they'll get enough from
you just in your energy.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.531 align:middle line:84%
They don't even need you
to do anything for them.

00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Just be who you are.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%
They just love your light.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It really does work that way.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.602 align:middle line:84%
So while I continue
with our theme of karma

00:15:21.602 --> 00:15:23.726 align:middle line:84%
or the law of cause and
effect-- what you give out,

00:15:23.726 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
you get back-- I thought
it would be really, really

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
interesting if I can
connect to the spirit world

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.047 align:middle line:84%
and find out what your karmic
obligation or karmic lessons

00:15:31.047 --> 00:15:33.005 align:middle line:84%
are with those loved ones
who have passed over.

00:15:33.005 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that sound cool?

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.256 align:middle line:90%
It sounds really good.

00:15:37.256 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:90%
Sounds cool.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to that.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.783 align:middle line:84%
So before we do that, I'd like
to welcome in the spirit world.

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And how we do that is this.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world is
always around us.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And I work for them, really.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But we're all in
the party together.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
In order for them to come into
this atmosphere which is around

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
you, I always say we
have to have a party.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to invite them
in and have a party.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.806 align:middle line:84%
Because I know all of
you, if you go to a party,

00:15:58.806 --> 00:16:00.680 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to go to
a place where there's

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
no food or drink or
music or lights are off.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you want to
have a good time, right?

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.121 align:middle line:84%
So-- so I think there's a
good way of inviting them in,

00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:90%
the spirit world.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.110 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see who comes in.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see it's really
not for you per se.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really for them who
needs to come through--

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:84%
not who you want
to come through,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:90%
but who needs to come through.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.062 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see as many
as we can do, yeah?

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll be very surprised
at certain things that

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.569 align:middle line:84%
come through with when they
come in, if they come in.

00:16:24.569 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:90%
I never know.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a crap shoot.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.874 align:middle line:84%
So to get this
party started right,

00:16:28.874 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:84%
we're going to do a little
meditation, a very little

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I just want to get the
energy set for them.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.566 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes, if you would.

00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:39.017 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.017 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And as you close
your eyes, I just

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
want you with your mind to just
be aware of the physical body.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of the sound
of my voice and the music

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:90%
gently behind it.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of your feet
on the floor, your legs,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
your backs on the chairs,
your shoulders and your arms,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
your neck and your head.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Also, just have out that
thought, that awareness.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:84%
Just consider that you, being
a light being, a spirit,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not limited
to the physical body.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
But your light goes way
beyond the physical body.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.514 align:middle line:90%
You are limitless and boundless.

00:17:20.514 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So your light goes all the
way down to Mother Earth.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:84%
Let's connect now with
Gaia, Mother Earth.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Connect with her
beautiful structure,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:90%
her nurturing energy.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:90%
She gives life to so much.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
We never give her gratitude,
yet we take from her abundance.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So now is a time where we could
have an attitude of gratitude

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
for Gaia, for Mother Earth,
and thank her and bless her

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
for sustaining us here on this
earth, on her lovely planet.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the energy come
up your feet, come up your legs.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:54.965 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:17:54.965 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling it up.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Seeing the auric changes.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Very nice.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And just feel
stabilized connecting

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:90%
with that lovely mother.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:90%
I always work with her.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I also at this point want you to
have that realization that way,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
way beyond us, above us, there
is a beautiful light world.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's a star
with your name on it.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.045 align:middle line:84%
Try to connect from
the top of your head

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful golden light
that reaches all the way up

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
with your mind to a star
that has your name on it

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:90%
and resonates with you.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, bring
that beautiful awareness

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:84%
of that light, that divine
energy, down into the body,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.575 align:middle line:90%
into your heart.

00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And as it comes
down into the heart,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.690 align:middle line:84%
that heart light opens
up in a green light

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and spreads throughout
the body of the human.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.465 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We can bring more of that
beautiful light awareness

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:90%
into the body with the breath.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
you to inhale-- we

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%
count to three-- to your heart.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.767 align:middle line:84%
And exhale out of
your mouth of all

00:18:58.767 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
the old, stagnant energy
you no longer need.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
So together, let's begin.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.816 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.850 align:middle line:84%
All that exhalation, all
the old stagnant energy

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
going down to Mother
Earth to recycle.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And inhale more of that
beautiful, golden light.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.885 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And just one more time,
feeling one with that light.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.615 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.239 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And now as you
sit in this space,

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to place
your mind upon your heart.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful green
light from your heart,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
the seat of unconditional
love, the seat of the soul,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:84%
the space of healing,
balance, harmony, peace,

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
your connection to
the oneness of being.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Love, by its very nature, is
not to keep, but to share.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.082 align:middle line:84%
So please surround yourself
with that green light

00:20:10.082 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head
to the bottom of your feet.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And then send it to the
person on your left side,

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.218 align:middle line:84%
surrounding them with that
beautiful, loving green light.

00:20:21.218 --> 00:20:23.406 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.406 --> 00:20:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Divine, heavenly parent,
we ask your blessing

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%
on this meeting today.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to me.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends,
speak clear to me.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Give us glimpses of
eternity, and let

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.932 align:middle line:90%
us know that you are free.

00:20:38.932 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:90%
We thank you and bless you.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:90%
So it is.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.063 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:20:45.063 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Was that nice?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy that?

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I see the colors
change in your auric field.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.761 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost a sense
sometimes of I get it now.

00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm in it.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm involved in it,
and it seems very real.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Your whole face changed.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.997 align:middle line:90%
Your whole face changed.

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:07.455 align:middle line:84%
You don't give yourself enough
time to experience yourself.

00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:09.262 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.262 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:90%
You worry a little bit.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sometimes.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, OK.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.198 align:middle line:84%
I first want to connect--
I have a gentleman standing

00:21:15.198 --> 00:21:16.164 align:middle line:90%
right here, right here.

00:21:16.164 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if he's
the father of one of yours.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But I feel your
father's passed over.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.134 align:middle line:90%
It's your father?

00:21:22.134 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hm.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:90%
So let me just get in here.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So as I come and
connect with this man

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.211 align:middle line:84%
as he was standing with
me during the meditation,

00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:29.502 align:middle line:90%
I must come to you.

00:21:29.502 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And let me just see what
this man wants to say to me.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I have a big family here
with this gentleman.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely
your father here.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a big family
coming in here.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.649 align:middle line:84%
I said-- tell your
father's been with you.

00:21:38.649 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Is there some mother on the
other side as well, please?

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: His mother?

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, his mother.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I'm with her.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm with two
siblings, by the way.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's
talking about two siblings

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:90%
that he's with as well, OK?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
know that he's there with

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and they're all coming in here.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you
about your dad here.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Grandmother.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:90%
You know your grandmother.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:90%
You would know her, she said.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And I see a height difference.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
she's very short.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But he's here.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:90%
She's here.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm
very aware of that.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that he said
he was in a car with you.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure it was here,
just getting here today.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.519 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel as if
there was a sudden stop.

00:22:08.519 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Or he said, you got
to pay attention.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.390 align:middle line:84%
There's something-- you weren't
looking somewhere in the car,

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, can I ask if
there's a scratch

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:90%
on that car on the side?

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.147 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:16.147 --> 00:22:16.979 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hm.

00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:18.468 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The windshield.

00:22:18.468 --> 00:22:19.335 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hm.

00:22:19.335 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said that you
didn't get it fixed yet.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's just mindful of that.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.205 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my god!

00:22:23.205 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because he was in
the car with you watching this,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So if I go to your car
and I'm sitting there

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and I have the rear view
mirror-- you know that?

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, the mirror, yes.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hm.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was either changed or
you did something with it.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There
was the easy pass.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:90%
We changed that.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:35.935 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you just
pulled it off just recently

00:22:35.935 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:90%
and changed it?

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.116 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:37.116 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God!

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.855 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
just call me James.

00:22:39.855 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So he was just
watching you do that.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Your dad is very much involved
and it's just to show you

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that I've always been
involved in your lives.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling me now some
of the karmic connection.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We have lessons
together, he said.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.073 align:middle line:90%
He's calling them lessons.

00:22:52.073 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:90%
He said, we share-- OK.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We share times
together, he said.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You look out for me,
I'll look out for you.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So he said, part of his karma--
and he's telling me this term

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
that I'm using here today--
he goes, James, it's not fully

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.849 align:middle line:84%
He said, let her know I'm
one of her protectors.

00:23:08.849 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, because--

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm one
of your protectors.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
wasn't close to him.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.274 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
well he is now.

00:23:13.274 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, he's
watching you drive.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:90%
One of your protectors.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is really
interesting you say that.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you weren't close
to him in the lifetime.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And just because of
that, in the spirit, now

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.922 align:middle line:90%
he can be close to you.

00:23:25.922 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's beautiful.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.285 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You see that.

00:23:27.285 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So there might have
been an obligation

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.515 align:middle line:84%
that he could not fulfill
while he was in the human body.

00:23:30.515 --> 00:23:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But certainly he
can in the spirit.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happened
to me and my mother.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.720 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't be with
me in the physical.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.606 align:middle line:84%
But when she passed
to spirit, she

00:23:35.606 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:84%
was my guide or
one of my guides.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's beautiful.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, I would know
about alcohol problem here.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So I know it would be
someone passed over who

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
would have had
drinking problems.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My uncle, yes.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your uncle.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Would that be related
to your father?

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.107 align:middle line:90%
Would that be--

00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, my mother.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle line:90%
My mother's brother.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, OK.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.775 align:middle line:84%
I know there's drinking
in that family.

00:23:51.775 --> 00:23:53.524 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to say
both sides somewhere.

00:23:53.524 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
So I say, the man on
your mother's side.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.843 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman on
your father's side.

00:23:56.843 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
I got to go there.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I just got to go there there.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I also want to go, by the
way, to your mother who's

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:90%
here living down here, right?

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So he talks
about her being down here, OK?

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's problems
either with a living situation

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
right now-- I know
things are going

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
up and down with her
living situation.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.660 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.244 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very aware
as he makes me aware.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.555 align:middle line:84%
He's talking to me about how you
have a change with the family,

00:24:20.555 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:84%
change her living
situation, or there's

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
talk about putting her someplace
or changing her or living

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
with somebody else,
changing things around.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
it's up in the air right now.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
dad didn't pass away

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
with like a blood pressure
aneurysm of some kind, did he?

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Heart attack.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, heart attack.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.125 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Massive
heart attack.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.699 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
had a heard attack.

00:24:37.699 --> 00:24:40.521 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say blood pressure
here, and I don't know why.

00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I want
your mother's blood

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:90%
pressure checked.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.108 align:middle line:84%
Am I predicting her dying
that way with the aneurysm?

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:90%
No, because I don't do that.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But I know that I need to
check blood pressure, just

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:90%
for her health, OK?

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.879 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I also
know that-- go on-- you

00:24:51.879 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:90%
have some jewelery which-- what?

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.095 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.095 --> 00:24:55.595 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
about-- she's talking

00:24:55.595 --> 00:24:58.095 align:middle line:84%
about you having this jewelery,
someone's jewelery you have.

00:24:58.095 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Is that grandmother's jewelery,
or whose the jewelry--

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I have my
grandmother's, but I also

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:90%
design jewelery.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Because they're talking
about jewelery with you.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.752 align:middle line:84%
And you were just looking
at jewelry as well.

00:25:06.752 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And if I come to you-- I
know you said you design it.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.918 align:middle line:84%
But they're showing me--
now this grandmother's

00:25:10.918 --> 00:25:12.510 align:middle line:84%
coming in who would
have known you

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.560 align:middle line:84%
when you were a little
girl-- a little girl.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And I do have patent leather
shoes on, by the way.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I do, and I'm clip-clapping
around, you know.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, when there
was a strap, this--

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.010 align:middle line:90%
what they call the--

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mary Janes.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know that you have them.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:90%
She shows me that.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my god.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember
that, don't you?

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.805 align:middle line:84%
And I know recently,
or she's giving me

00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:31.547 align:middle line:84%
this-- grandma's giving me--
she's very interested in your--

00:25:31.547 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:90%
what are you saying?

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.734 align:middle line:84%
Karmically, we're
connected, too, always.

00:25:34.734 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's very interesting.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:84%
She said, I am with the
female side of the family.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the one who takes
care of the females.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And that you could say is
my karma she's on about.

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, so-- but she
likes to be more

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
with the female side
than the male side.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.140 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm more
understood with the females

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:90%
than the males.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's talking about.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I was a church-going
lady, she said.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.775 align:middle line:84%
She was just-- I was
a church-going lady.

00:25:53.775 --> 00:25:55.730 align:middle line:84%
She didn't believe necessarily
in this sort of a thing.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.479 align:middle line:90%
But she's there.

00:25:56.479 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And she wants me to
tell you that you

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of strange
filing system with your jewelry.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.844 align:middle line:84%
So-- you understand
that, don't you?

00:26:03.844 --> 00:26:05.510 align:middle line:84%
No one really can
understand it but you.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.241 align:middle line:84%
She wants me to tell
you about either-- what?

00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.602 align:middle line:84%
Bringing somebody
into your business.

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Or there's been talk
about you bringing someone

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:90%
into the business, sharing it.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.266 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:26:16.266 --> 00:26:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
just be careful.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You just be careful
about that, OK?

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.625 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know this lady loves to
live through you because she

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
didn't have an opportunity
to live for herself when

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.746 align:middle line:90%
she was alive.

00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:84%
She had to do everything
everybody wanted.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.690 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you with that.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.310 align:middle line:84%
You need new brakes on the
car, your father just said.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.440 align:middle line:84%
He said you're
putting the brakes

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.625 align:middle line:90%
on the car, your new car.

00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:37.000 align:middle line:84%
You understand
about that, right?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's an old car.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But you've been
putting-- you need new brakes

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
or you've been delaying
putting some brakes.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.635 align:middle line:84%
You're delaying doing something
with the brakes, correct?

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:44.987 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was-- shot, yes.

00:26:44.987 --> 00:26:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Around the wheels?

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:46.986 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:46.986 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.325 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:26:49.325 --> 00:26:51.672 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.672 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
your father, not mine.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.842 align:middle line:84%
And I know he wants
you-- and I know

00:26:55.842 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:84%
your mother-- don't
want you to get

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:84%
as obsessed with your mother
as far as you doing everything.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, we had a lovely
lady here talking

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
about how she feels she's got
to do everything for everyone.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that, OK?

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got to let your other
family members help in, OK?

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Your mom's having trouble
with her legs, by the way.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.505 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
she needs to, you

00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
know-- so if we can get someone
there to take care of the legs.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.690 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been
rubbing her legs.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:90%
You've been massaging her legs.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:15.340 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't
live near her.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who's doing
the massaging of her legs?

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She has an aid.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Because your dad's talking
about massaging her legs.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And her mother's over
here watching it.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And she said that's really
good for her circulation.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.860 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that, OK?

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.323 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:27:26.323 --> 00:27:27.545 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:32.912 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.912 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a gentlemen
that comes here.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And this man would
be about probably 68,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.706 align:middle line:84%
around 68, late 60s
when he passes away.

00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I have
dark hair back

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:90%
to the-- back this way here.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:90%
I feel this man-- I'm OK.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty calm, I'm pretty
mild person in the lifetime.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.847 align:middle line:84%
And I feel, though--
and when I pass away,

00:27:49.847 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not overly surprised, but
I'm very enlightened, very

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
happy that I've found this
place, that there is no death,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.042 align:middle line:90%
and that I'm very happy here.

00:27:58.042 --> 00:27:59.125 align:middle line:90%
I was quiet in a lifetime.

00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:90%
But I feel like a gentle soul.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I got
to go with this man.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.329 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I feel like my hair
is straight back, brown back.

00:28:06.329 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Might be a little balding here.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.146 align:middle line:84%
But feels slicking
my hair back here.

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
get more with this man.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel-- or, I was in the
hospital here and there.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:84%
There might have been
some blood sugar diabetes

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.940 align:middle line:84%
problem at one point or
that'd being significant.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I know that recently,
my name was brought up

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.554 align:middle line:84%
in a family situation
or a thought of me.

00:28:23.554 --> 00:28:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
got to give out.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:90%
It make senses?

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It make sense to you?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.135 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
understand the name Pete?

00:28:29.135 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what makes sense.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.472 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Pete
is my grandfather.

00:28:32.472 --> 00:28:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.500 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He died
a few years ago.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:90%
He was tall.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.124 align:middle line:84%
When he was younger,
he had black hair.

00:28:42.124 --> 00:28:43.915 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Brought
it back at one point?

00:28:43.915 --> 00:28:44.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, slicked it back?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.099 align:middle line:90%
And what about diabetes?

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, he
used to be really heavy.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.554 align:middle line:84%
And then he had to lose weight
because the doctors were

00:28:54.554 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:90%
concerned that--

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
you know about those scars

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.800 align:middle line:90%
that he was referring to?

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So scars either in the
leg or around the knees.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if there
was talk about even getting--

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.380 align:middle line:84%
amputating a leg or
something at one point.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But there might have
been some scars here.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you not know that?

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.792 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm not sure, but
he was a World War II veteran.

00:29:08.792 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So I do
know that he had scars.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:90%
And I remember.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I go here, too--
I just-- he shows it really,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.625 align:middle line:90%
really clearly.

00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:15.634 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:29:15.634 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Marialena.

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Marialena.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
May I bring through
more for you, please?

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And would you know a--
Anna-- Anne-- Anna?

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I
have an aunt Anna.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: On this side?

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I know that he comes from a
big family as a young boy.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So I go back into memory
with this gentleman.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.513 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back to young time.

00:29:32.513 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I know there's movement all
around, different places.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I need to get--
I don't feel like he had--

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.985 align:middle line:84%
he gives me a sense that he
wasn't wealthy growing up.

00:29:39.985 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I feel it was kind of-- I
don't want to say dirt poor.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:84%
But it was farm or
it was-- it was poor.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it was, you know,
they didn't have a lot.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.877 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he tries
to make the best he can.

00:29:48.877 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
this second generation back--

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.889 align:middle line:84%
the second generation
from him has

00:29:53.889 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:90%
a much better life than he had.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.448 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:29:56.448 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that he would have either
lost a son in his lifetime--

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.170 align:middle line:90%
do you understand that please?

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So I know that karmically that
that was a lesson, karmically,

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that that soul, those
two souls went through.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And that definitely
was karmic in that.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I think in the
past incarnation--

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm putting my spin
into this-- that he left early.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And that other soul had to know
what it's like to lose a child.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:90%
So it has to be balanced out.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
a wholeness, OK?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:84%
I need to let you know
that I'm with my son now.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm with my son now,
and they are reunited.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know this man, as we spoke
about earlier, has-- really?

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.830 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.780 align:middle line:84%
He's very philosophical
now when he's coming in.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And now that we've
let him speak,

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
he's now coming
out of his shell.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if I say
that to you, I think

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.979 align:middle line:84%
once you got to
know this man, you

00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:50.520 align:middle line:84%
heard about a lot
of stories he told.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:90%
There were a lot of stories.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think you knew
him really well, by the way.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
But I know you know
him through stories.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.719 align:middle line:84%
And I know when he's a young
man, he's a shyish kind of guy,

00:30:58.719 --> 00:30:59.232 align:middle line:90%
stands back.

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:00.940 align:middle line:84%
But now when he's
invited into the space,

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:90%
he opens up and speaks.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I know I do a lot
for brothers of mine.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.012 align:middle line:84%
I know I work with my
brothers when I'm younger.

00:31:07.012 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:90%
I know I work with a company.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.962 align:middle line:90%
I run the family.

00:31:08.962 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.971 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm very
aware that we took tenants

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:90%
into the place we lived in.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So there were
other people living

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.305 align:middle line:90%
in that place like tenants.

00:31:16.305 --> 00:31:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:18.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:90%
Just so we can hear you.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There
was a separate house.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
they rented it out

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.440 align:middle line:84%
or had people stay
in there, correct,?

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, uh-huh.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.029 align:middle line:84%
I know that this man tells
me he had-- one of his ears

00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:27.030 align:middle line:90%
did not work.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So he said, one of his ears--
I think it was a left ear.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:29.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But he couldn't
hear out of one ear.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hearing aid, yes.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.355 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wouldn't there
be a Robert somewhere, please?

00:31:34.355 --> 00:31:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Robert
is the son who died.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Robert's
the son who died.

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.643 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:37.643 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I'm
with this Robert.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.026 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I hear you.

00:31:41.026 --> 00:31:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:42.700 align:middle line:90%
He's really pushy.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.169 align:middle line:90%
He said, get it right, James!

00:31:44.169 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm getting it right.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my best.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, where's your mom?

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Is she still living?

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:49.783 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
wearing a scarf here.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:84%
But your mother's wearing
scarfs, he's telling me.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, your mother loves
to wear scarves herself.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So he says, he always sees
her with scarves around her.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.088 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And if you could
bring your mother to Paris--

00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand about the

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:90%
going to Paris with your mother?

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.149 align:middle line:90%
Because he's telling me that.

00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:08.731 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
if that-- thank you.

00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I hear you now.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.960 align:middle line:84%
He's letting-- he likes to
play music still, he said.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.251 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you understand
about the Paris connection.

00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that already
happened or you're going to.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.708 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She went to
Paris and she came back

00:32:19.708 --> 00:32:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and said she wants
to go together.

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fab.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's like
one of her dreams.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say to you that
this gentleman and the family

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.321 align:middle line:84%
on her side--
mother, father, yes--

00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:31.820 align:middle line:84%
they're making that
happen for them.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.700 align:middle line:90%
For her and for you.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.691 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.691 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So I know that-- of
course, here we go,

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.703 align:middle line:84%
karma again-- that
you and your mother

00:32:37.703 --> 00:32:39.332 align:middle line:90%
have a very close relationship.

00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very
aware that there

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.331 align:middle line:84%
was a separation in
the time that you

00:32:42.331 --> 00:32:45.141 align:middle line:84%
two could be together,
whether it was school or work,

00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:84%
four years you
couldn't be together.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.680 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Four years.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Not five years, not three,
but there were four years.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And you were going to get
those times back in Paris.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Would you have a
glass of wine for them

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.150 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit as a celebration?

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Because they get you there,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll see how
weird things happen.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And next year
spring time, you'll

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:90%
see how it all falls into place.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.104 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- they're
pulling the strings.

00:33:07.104 --> 00:33:08.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you with that.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK, sweetheart?

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And love to your mother by the
way from everyone over here.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I know she had a brother
that passed as well.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give--
you understand that?

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
And I want to give love

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:84%
from her brother
who's helping her out.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.294 align:middle line:90%
And she's-- what?

00:33:18.294 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
She's in between cleaning
closets out and moving things

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.682 align:middle line:84%
around and storage
and moving things.

00:33:23.682 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.306 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:25.306 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
My sisters just
moved this weekend.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Just-- this weekend?

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
were moving boxes.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great, great.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.469 align:middle line:90%
This weekend.

00:33:30.469 --> 00:33:31.010 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So I know that they've
talked to me about that.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very aware that
they're helping with that move.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a good thing.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
She needs to have
some reassurance

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:90%
she's doing the right thing.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to leave
you with that, OK?

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:90%
So much love.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Please give to her.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.950 align:middle line:90%
They're screaming at you.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Stop complaining
about losing weight.

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:48.846 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.846 --> 00:33:49.345 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.755 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
started a diet this week.

00:33:52.755 --> 00:33:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you
start a diet this week?

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.004 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
saying to me, you

00:33:56.004 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:84%
stop beating yourself
up about losing weight.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.570 align:middle line:84%
When you look in that mirror,
say, oh, I got to lose weight,

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.520 align:middle line:90%
stop it.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.880 align:middle line:90%
You're a beautiful being.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So you curtail certain
things like not

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:90%
eat-- I don't eat bread anymore.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:90%
But it helps.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:90%
So you just watch what you eat.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.224 align:middle line:90%
But you're beautiful.

00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't put yourself at--
oh, you're beautiful.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.059 align:middle line:84%
They don't like you
see-- they don't

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
like to see you beat yourself
up in front of the mirror, OK?

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So would you respect
and honor yourself?

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.481 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.139 align:middle line:90%
I love doing this work.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.350 align:middle line:90%
It's like being the love doctor.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%


00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:36.364 align:middle line:90%
Doctor Bob Bay.

00:34:36.364 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's really interesting.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I love that, being
the conduit for the spirit.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.446 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you.

00:34:40.446 --> 00:34:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And as I stop the
connection, it's

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.310 align:middle line:84%
almost as if they really
want to still continue.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.510 align:middle line:90%
So they'll be with you.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.817 align:middle line:90%
So they'll be with you, yeah?

00:34:46.817 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
important you realize

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.820 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't stop
just when I stop.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.520 align:middle line:84%
They're close and
you can hear them

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.830 align:middle line:84%
if you just get out of your
head into that heart space

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.454 align:middle line:84%
and just listen to
the subtle whispers.

00:34:56.454 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it is.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:58.988 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady who
comes to me here.

00:34:58.988 --> 00:35:00.014 align:middle line:90%
It's a mother figure.

00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a mother figure, a
mother-in-law, I'm not sure.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.804 align:middle line:84%
There's a motherly
feel-- feeling here.

00:35:03.804 --> 00:35:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm in my
'70s when I pass over.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if I shouldn't
have gone when I went.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the feeling
this lady gives me,

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.456 align:middle line:84%
and she's talking about
getting her hair done.

00:35:11.456 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And she likes to have her
hair highlighted, done.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle line:90%
Wavy hair I have here.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It looks more to the lighter
side than darker side,

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.440 align:middle line:84%
but brownish with some
light-- I don't know,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.000 align:middle line:90%
brown with light hair.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a hair person.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But-- and I know
that some-- I know

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.022 align:middle line:84%
that I'm either-- either
an operation or procedure.

00:35:29.022 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And I shouldn't
have gone, or there

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.770 align:middle line:84%
wasn't expecting me
to pass, and I did.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I-- I know
that I'm aware of that.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.695 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very healthy
really up to that point.

00:35:37.695 --> 00:35:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I
have to come in here.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know I have to
let myself be known.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And go on, what else, love?

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:90%
She needs to be called out.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So does that make
sense to somebody?

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:49.900 align:middle line:90%
No one yet.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.935 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:50.935 --> 00:35:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Got it, got it.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.435 align:middle line:90%
I know it's a mother.

00:35:52.435 --> 00:35:54.252 align:middle line:84%
So keep on going with
that mother-- mother.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And now I have a daughter
here in the audience.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.668 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.668 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It might be me.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.571 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Might be you.

00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:01.320 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Tammy.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Tammy.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if it works for you.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.366 align:middle line:84%
If it works for
somebody else, would you

00:36:05.366 --> 00:36:06.749 align:middle line:90%
stand up and let me know?

00:36:06.749 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry, gentlemen.

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- it's not for you.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.396 align:middle line:90%
I know it isn't.

00:36:09.396 --> 00:36:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Because she said her
daughter is here.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:90%
So I gotta go with that.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there would have
been a procedure of some kind,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:14.680 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's the word
I want to use-- procedure.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing, please?

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:18.818 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:36:18.818 --> 00:36:19.649 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.649 --> 00:36:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Tammy, so you
understand about the mother

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.480 align:middle line:90%
figure who passes over that way.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So I know that lady likes to--
she's talking about her hair.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you could remember--
because if this make sense.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't make
sense, you say no, OK?

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I know
what this lady comes in

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and I need to come through.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I have a need to speak.

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I have a need to come
through because I've

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:84%
been trying to express
myself for a long time.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't-- they haven't
been listening to me.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's her personality.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.080 align:middle line:90%
She's loud.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.200 align:middle line:90%
She's-- oh.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.924 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
tell you that-- go on.

00:36:43.924 --> 00:36:46.090 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't like to beat
herself up, which is great.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I shouldn't
have had something done.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Or something's the second--
the procedure of some kind

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.394 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have happened
the way it did.

00:36:51.394 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't say mm-hm.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Say yes.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:56.759 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:56.759 --> 00:36:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she wants
me to tell about her face.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I know she's talking about
breathing problem, too.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So before she passes,
I cannot breathe.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:90%
So they gave her oxygen.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember that?

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yeah.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.245 align:middle line:84%
Now I know you must
have necklaces of hers.

00:37:09.245 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she's telling me necklaces.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:12.765 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know that there's

00:37:12.765 --> 00:37:15.407 align:middle line:84%
Indian necklaces or Indian
jewelery that she had as well.

00:37:15.407 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She liked
turquoise a lot.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Turquoise,
that was the word.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Turquoise.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.030 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a ring that I
can put on this finger here.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that I have
earrings as well.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm very, very aware
of that-- I love that culture.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course, being from
Wyoming, she would be.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I know there
must be two houses as well.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Like the
cabin and the house.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand yes.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:34.605 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
she have known of that

00:37:34.605 --> 00:37:35.560 align:middle line:90%
then in her lifetime?

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.420 align:middle line:90%
So there'd be two places.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:37.797 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:38.551 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:39.051 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I know what she says.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.835 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm
under anesthesia.

00:37:42.835 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
I don't like the anesthesia.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:46.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:48.139 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that I'm afraid to go

00:37:48.139 --> 00:37:50.015 align:middle line:84%
into under anesthesia
before I go.

00:37:50.015 --> 00:37:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know she must
have spoken to you about that.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.646 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did she
mention it to you?

00:37:56.646 --> 00:37:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:90%
She went in and had procedures.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they found out
she had like a tumor

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:03.571 align:middle line:90%
on her pituitary gland.

00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They
decided to take it off.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
they shouldn't have.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But she
actually did come home

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.411 align:middle line:84%
and died before she went
back in the second time.

00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The second time.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.379 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:38:12.379 --> 00:38:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Because she's just
telling me there's

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:84%
a procedure I should
not have had done.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't
know why she's mention

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.094 align:middle line:90%
Carol's-- the name Carol.

00:38:18.094 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hm--

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But
she's mentioning

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Carolynn or Caroline,
this sort of thing.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Caroline?

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.170 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
my friend Carol.

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Carol, OK.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And you came with her.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:24.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Carol, your mother's also
passed over to the side, please.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that she's coming with her.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing also?

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So Carol-- so I know
that you might not

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.861 align:middle line:84%
have known her mother
in the lifetime.

00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know her
mother, did you?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I
know that your two

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.030 align:middle line:90%
mothers know each other.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.116 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that they brought you

00:38:43.116 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:90%
together in their own way, OK?

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.500 align:middle line:84%
I know that with your mother, I
feel inside all messed up here.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel-- I don't know if it
was a cancerous condition,

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:90%
but I feel it was.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:52.618 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm

00:38:52.618 --> 00:38:56.597 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I just feel
like I'm really depleted.

00:38:56.597 --> 00:38:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just got to tell you
I have trouble walking,

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I have trouble
controlling everything.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.649 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know-- if
I get emotional here with her.

00:39:04.649 --> 00:39:06.565 align:middle line:84%
She's coming in, very
different personalities.

00:39:06.565 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Suck it up.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Just let her come in here.

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.682 align:middle line:84%
She's coming really
close to me because she

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:90%
wants you to know she's fine.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:90%


00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.667 align:middle line:84%
You remind her of herself
when she was younger.

00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:18.750 align:middle line:90%
You remind her of herself.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:19.874 align:middle line:90%
And you even look like her.

00:39:19.874 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You can see a physicality which
is very similar, she said.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I never
meant to hurt you.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I never meant to--
never had the feeling

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that I loved others
more than you.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.712 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.712 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:90%
You understand that, my love?

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.190 align:middle line:90%


00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.051 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:34.051 --> 00:39:34.884 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:39:34.884 --> 00:39:36.210 align:middle line:90%


00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't want you
to have that feeling.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not true.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, if she
presented herself

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:90%
that way, I'm very sorry.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.340 align:middle line:90%
She's very sorry.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know karmically,
there's definitely

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.960 align:middle line:84%
a relationship here
with you and your mom.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.837 align:middle line:84%
Obligate-- there's
definitely strong ones.

00:39:50.837 --> 00:39:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, your dad must have
passed over as well.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, because I
can feel your dad's over there

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.590 align:middle line:84%
for quite a while
before your mom.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your dad
sets up the position,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.861 align:middle line:84%
sets up the scenario, sets
up the space for your mother

00:40:01.861 --> 00:40:02.880 align:middle line:90%
to come over.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that we have a lovely
fire going on in the fireplace.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I know your dad likes
a stone fireplace.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I know that he feels
very home with a stone

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.327 align:middle line:90%
fireplace, a wooden fire.

00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:84%
He feels I want to sit there
in front of that fireplace.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.285 align:middle line:84%
And I could be--
that's his meditation.

00:40:16.285 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
you have the happy memory

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.444 align:middle line:84%
which he has which is of the
grandkids running around?

00:40:22.444 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
would be in that room

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:90%
when that fireplace is going.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I have a table there,
like a coffee table.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I have a carpet underneath
that coffee table.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And I have wooden
floors underneath that.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:90%
That's what he shows me.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very, very aware of that.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I see that was one of the
happiest times-- happy times,

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.650 align:middle line:90%
happy times.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:41.850 align:middle line:90%
And he has a son as well.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a son?

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.781 align:middle line:90%
Or do you have a son?

00:40:43.781 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Your dad?

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have a son.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You have a son.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And
I have a brother.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.074 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, OK.

00:40:47.074 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Still live down here?

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So the
brother would be his son.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.393 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:40:51.393 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Would you please give
love to there please, OK?

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, got to do that.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I know it's hard
for the two of you.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I know it's very difficult.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:90%
I know you haven't spoken.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I know you have different lives.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.247 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
there's a commonality.

00:41:02.247 --> 00:41:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to tell
you that he's with him.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.990 align:middle line:90%
He's with your brother.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:07.512 align:middle line:90%
And I need to tell you that.

00:41:07.512 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Carol, you need speak to him.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.490 align:middle line:84%
In your mind, you can speak
to him or write a letter.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you can do, OK?

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there
was some healing

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.860 align:middle line:90%
that's still needed there.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.444 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK

00:41:15.444 --> 00:41:17.734 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that I
come in here and tell you--

00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and your mother
wants to tell you,

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.600 align:middle line:84%
she's-- she's a pipsqueak
when she comes in.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:84%
She's-- she's not as
outgoing as your dad is when

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.324 align:middle line:90%
she's speaking.

00:41:24.324 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But I know that there's
a flag you have.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:84%
You either have a flag
of your dad's or a flag

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.740 align:middle line:90%
that belonged in that household.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.412 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:30.412 --> 00:41:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, good.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.294 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very, very much.

00:41:32.294 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're
not doing this alone.

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I know that your mother--
your mother-- your father

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.950 align:middle line:84%
brings her here so she can
see that she's better now.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.291 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:44.965 align:middle line:84%
That you are better,
that she's better,

00:41:44.965 --> 00:41:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and that your
mother feels better.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Your mother took a
little bit of a while

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to get her strength back when
she passed into the light.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.770 align:middle line:84%
When she passed
into the spirit, she

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.680 align:middle line:84%
had a little bit of time to
get back-- her sustainability,

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.540 align:middle line:90%
she had to.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And he brought her here
tonight, and you brought her.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Your mother also is helping her.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
your mother might

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.136 align:middle line:84%
have been over a bit
longer than her mom

00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and helping her show the way.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:90%
So she's showing her the way.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're good friends now.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if they play cards,

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:90%
but they're going to play cards.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.770 align:middle line:90%
And they're going to do crafts.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.617 align:middle line:84%
And they like you
two being friends.

00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to say
one more thing here--

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that you created friendships
here and in heaven

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and that they come
back and make that

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.940 align:middle line:84%
manifest kind of through you
guys in that they can come back

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.695 align:middle line:90%
and karmic-- good karma.

00:42:24.695 --> 00:42:25.820 align:middle line:90%
We want to hold good karma.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.150 align:middle line:84%
It's good stuff that
you two came together.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
be lifetime friends.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's a trip coming
up for both of you sharing it.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
with you all the way.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So God bless you both.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you all with that.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.166 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:38.166 --> 00:42:42.514 align:middle line:90%


00:42:42.514 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So it's a
very, very interesting topic

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.562 align:middle line:90%
and subject.

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And we can definitely go more
in depth to karma, of energy,

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.478 align:middle line:84%
of what you give
out, you get back.

00:42:49.478 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And remember that
they see everything

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:90%
that you're thinking.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So send out happy
thoughts, good karma.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And please continue doing
that the rest of your life.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And I hope to see you again.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that's
watching, good karma.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.597 align:middle line:90%
Send out good energy.

00:43:01.597 --> 00:43:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Until the next time.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everybody.

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.258 align:middle line:90%
Love and light to all of you.

00:43:04.258 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:24.834 align:middle line:90%
