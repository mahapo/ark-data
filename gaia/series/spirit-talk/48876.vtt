[APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you everyone.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.264 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Thank you.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And thank you very
much for joining us

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
for another version of
Spirit Talk, where I take

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:10%
I want to thank you very,
very much for joining us

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.030 align:middle line:10%
and today's a very special day.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:10%
I woke up this morning
and a spirit came

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:10%
to me as they do every day.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
But I said to them
or I talked to them

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:10%
and I said what
topic-- what should we

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:10%
talk about today on the show.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And they said you need to
speak about spirit guides.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.966 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody has
a guide and people

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
want to know about their
guides and we want you to bring

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.054 align:middle line:90%
information about guides.

00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
going to have today.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Is that good?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
How many people
have been in contact

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:90%
with the guides you know about?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.619 align:middle line:84%
Very good.
Yes?

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And just curiosity, what kind
of guide you think you have

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
or what have you been
aware of your guide?

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:90%
What kind of guide?

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Her name's Elizabeth.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
We met gosh I guess
quite a few years ago

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and she's part of my daily life.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.666 align:middle line:84%
We talk, I ask her for
help, she gives help.

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Fantastic.
-And so--

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Fantastic and that
was during meditation

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that you found out who she was?

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Meditation absolutely

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.277 align:middle line:84%
The number one way,
the number one way.

00:01:38.277 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Very, very good very
good sweetheart.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Why thank you.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.473 align:middle line:84%
And somebody over
here also mentioned--

00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:90%
you raised your hand sir.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
If you want to stand
up and let us--

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:90%
and who's one of your guides?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:90%
I always feel my mother.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.656 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You always
feel your mother.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes mother can be guide
very, very much so.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Very, very much so.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.441 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else they feel no?
- Just my mother.

00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Just your mom.
OK good, very good.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if she comes in
later, we'll see hopefully.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:90%
OK great.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And then some people over
here also raised their hands.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.931 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure and
this lovely lady

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:03.164 align:middle line:84%
here in the front
row and we're going

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:90%
to give you the microphone.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And who do you
believe your guide is

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:90%
or you've been in contact with?

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:90%
His name is Mark.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: His name is Mark.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.947 align:middle line:84%
It's spelled M-A-R-C
and I dreamed about him

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:90%
and I asked to dream about him.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You dreamed about
him, another way which

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:90%
you can contact your guides.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.629 align:middle line:84%
A very, very good way.
Excellent.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And spirit loved ones also.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.685 align:middle line:84%
You can go through
the dream state

00:02:19.685 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and actually communicate
with your loved

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.400 align:middle line:90%
ones and your guides.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Very good, thank you very much.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to what
I do with people is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I often will talk
about really the two

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
ways of getting in contact with
your guides and your loved one.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Number one is
through meditation.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is the number one
way because you kind of open up

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.750 align:middle line:84%
your mind and you really receive
and your ego isn't in the way

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.860 align:middle line:90%
trying to control everything.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't block it, yes?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh and the other way
is the dream state.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So before you go
to sleep at night

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
you could send out a thought to
your loved ones, to your guides

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and say in that little bit
before you go to sleep,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that twilight state, if you
will say I want to see my guides

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:90%
please present yourself to me.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Please present yourself
to me in my mind.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you that
within-- I can't tell you

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:84%
time-wise a week to a
mother or a few months--

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
you will have an
image, a very clear

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
direction of who
one of your guides

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:90%
or several of your guides are.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:90%
So try it out, it will work.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It works for you so try it out.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
You know people
think that guides

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
are with you for a lifetime
and that's not always true.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.666 align:middle line:84%
So there are different
types of guides so I just

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:84%
want to give a little bit a list
of different types of guides

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The first that you have
are personal guides.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So personal guides could
consist of loved ones,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:84%
your mother passed over is
a personal guide of yours,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
so it could be
family, loved ones.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It could be people that you've
known in other lifetimes

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and it can be people who are
very close to you in your soul

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
group whoever connection
with you and through you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
they are learning, they
are growing as well

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.000 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
in the spirit form,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.733 align:middle line:84%
they're learning and growing
through your experience

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:84%
here on the earth,
so that does happen.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so those are personal
guides mother, father,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
relatives, friends as well.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very interesting
when my mom passed over,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
very similar to you, what's so
interesting-- because I also

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
was wondering who
one of my guides were

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was told my mother was
one of my guides one of many.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said wow now
this was interesting

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
why would my mother
be a guide of mine

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
because I would think well
she was a family member

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and she passed over and I want
her to be in her own level

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
over there of expressing
life in the spirit world.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And she came through to me and
she said I am a guide of yours.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping you from
this side of life

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't feel
that she helped me enough

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
the physical world because you
thought she wasn't here for me.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And she had an addiction
of some kind alcoholism

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and she wasn't there to be with
me so she felt to be with me

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
more now for the other side of
life as a guide and a teacher.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And she's done a great job.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So we also grow from the
other side of life as well.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
We just don't grow here, we also
grow as guides, as teachers.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
We spiritually evolve on
the other side as well.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Very, very important
you know that.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
personal guides.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
The next level of guides
would say-- I would say really

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.920 align:middle line:84%
are career guides
and career guides are

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:90%
those specialists, if you will.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.014 align:middle line:84%
Those specialists
will come close to you

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and let's say you're
starting to do

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:90%
something new, a new project.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're taking
up oil painting, yes?

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And you really want--
you want to really work

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
with that ability that
you have oil painting

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and you really want
to start using that.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Well just by that
thought, just by wanting

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to do that project
you will attract

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to you those
specialists if you will

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
who have a specialty in
that gift, oil painting

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you're going to do.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.160 align:middle line:84%
When I started being a medium
or developing as a medium

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
I would attract to me all of
these scientists, doctors who

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
worked with my energy
system in order

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to help facilitate my
medium mystic abilities,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.154 align:middle line:90%
my sensitivity, if you will.

00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So they would come in they
would be career guides,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
they would help to
move things around,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
open me up to
certain ways and they

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
were with me in the
development of my abilities.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Now so all the time you
are doing a project,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
being involved in something,
you will draw to those guides

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
where they're specifically
as you're working guides,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:90%
as your career guides.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:90%
So always remember that.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you finish a
project, their job is done.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you're writing
a book let's say also

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.470 align:middle line:84%
you'll bring to you those
guides, those teachers who

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
helped me write
that book helping

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:90%
inspire you to write that book.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah so it's pretty cool.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And the last guides,
the last one's I'm

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
are your inspirers,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
your helpers, your
spiritual guides,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual teachers.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Those beams of light
who are on a very

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
high, high level of awareness
of spiritual evolvement

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are the inspirers,
those are the philosophers,

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
those are the teachers that
every single person also has.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And many times when I
look at a group like this.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.685 align:middle line:84%
I will see standing behind
somebody a wonderful guy that

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
looks like-- this particular
time I'm talking about there

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
was a man who stood
behind this lady

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.345 align:middle line:90%
and he was a Greek philosopher.

00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him what does
he do for her and he said

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I inspire her with
truths that she knows

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:90%
about but she's forgotten.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
She knows about but
she's forgotten.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And this lady ended up
when I was talking to her,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
she's a healer she's an
amazing spiritual healer

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and she works through books and
she works through- She writes

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
scripts for movies
and things like that,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and he helps with her.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So we do have those beings
who are very, very evolved

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
who help to if you will
ignite a part of us,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
ignite that flame
inside of us to open

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.601 align:middle line:84%
us up to our higher selves, to
our higher sense of beingness.

00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
you know that.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And they will stay with you
in lifetime or lifetimes.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Not just one
lifetime, they can be

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:90%
with you many, many lifetimes.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now before we come back
into the incarnation

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:84%
into this earth, many times
we as souls will sit around

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
with our spirit guides,
our teachers and we will

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:90%
go through our upcoming life.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go through
different destiny points

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.270 align:middle line:90%
and lessons we must learn.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk to them and we
will really confer with them

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
about what's the best
opportunity to learn

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
this particular lesson.
Yeah.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's about
unconditional love,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:90%
about forgiveness.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's about just
loving ourselves, treating

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.897 align:middle line:90%
each other with the respect.

00:07:49.897 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
There are different lessons
that we're going to go through

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and our guys will sit
with us and actually

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
give us like a curriculum of
what we're going to go through.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's really amazing it
is really, really amazing.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
the more aware you

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
are of your guides
and your teachers,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:84%
the more you can use them to
help you every single day.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And the more your communication
you can just say be there

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:90%
with me, help me through this.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you can receive answers,
you could receive impressions,

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
inspirations from them.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
To receive the
proper information

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:90%
from the highest mind.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, eh?

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
A couple questions
from the audience?

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.145 align:middle line:90%
OK, yes ma'am.

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've
met my spirit guide

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
but I think I've heard her--
JAMES: Yes.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
A few times in crisis
situations where like once

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
a dog was attacking
was coming up

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
to attack with my
dogs and another time

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:84%
when I, don't tell mom,
had hitchhiked to Santa Fe

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.109 align:middle line:90%
and didn't have a ride home

00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oops.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
She came and told me go
back to where you're standing

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and then ten minutes
later somebody I knew

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:84%
came and took me home
to all the way here.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:10%
Very much so.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:10%
FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: But
I heard her talking to me

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and this has happened
several times.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And so do we have crisis guides?

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Or will I ever see her?

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:10%
Fabulous question, a great
experience and your experience

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:10%
is just like everybody else.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:10%
So we do have guides, we have
people that look out for us.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Part of guides, the
higher minded people

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is really to look out for us,
to take care of us if you will.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Really hold us in their
arms and make sure

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that things don't happen to us.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:90%
They protect us.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
We call them protective
guides as well

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and that could also
be a family relative,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
it could be a guy that's
a relative of yours again,

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:90%
someone who is very close you.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So those are more of the ones
that I see that are protecting,

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
they're more the personal
guides that protect.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Many, many times you
will hear your guides

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
through impressions
or a feeling that you

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:90%
get some kind of feeling.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
relate, start relating

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that feeling that you're getting
when you ask a certain guide

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to come in, they
you can associate

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.201 align:middle line:84%
that guide with a feeling and
you know when they're with you.

00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
So it's a very good question.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
In a few moments we're actually
going to connect our guides

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to give you a
way that you too can also have

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
an association and a
permanent connection with them

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that you can use.
Yes.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I know we have one more
question over here Hi.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:90%
I have met my guide.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
One of your guides.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:90%
One of my guides.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
It was in a stressful situation

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:90%
Very similar.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And he came to me and
he put his arms around me

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and he said everything
will be all right.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen him in my
dreams as I grow, he grows.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Exactly.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So like I said earlier just
because we're here on the earth

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and we have those in
the spirit, it doesn't

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:90%
mean that they're beyond us.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
As we grow they
will grow as well.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.882 align:middle line:84%
You bet as we expand,
they will expand as well.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.415 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
we're working in concert,

00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
we're working
together with them.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And again guides
protect us and help us.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
They have an investment with
us because we're all connected

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in the physical
body or in spirit form,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:90%
we're all one energy.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And for some connection they
take a liking to certain soul

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.175 align:middle line:84%
who they maybe have been
through lifetimes with

00:10:52.175 --> 00:10:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and they want to perfect
the best that's within you

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and they'll do anything they
can to make that happen.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So very, very good.
-Thank you.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome OK, good.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.987 align:middle line:84%
OK so now we're going to
take a little journey.

00:11:02.987 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to go on
a little journey with me?

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.319 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:10%
So this journey is to
connect with your guides

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:10%
and have a wonderful
experience and it's

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:10%
an experience I
hope that you can

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:10%
use for the rest of your lives.
Yes.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:10%
So I would just like you to
just close your eyes just

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.055 align:middle line:10%
a few moments and
let me guide you

00:11:17.055 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:10%
to a wonderful
beautiful light world.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So as you sit in this
space whether you're

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
sitting in a chair or
whether you're lying down,

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to
concentrate on the sound

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
of my voice Perhaps you'll
hear the music behind it

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and I just want you to
be aware of yourself,

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:90%
of your physical body.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Make sure your feet are
on the floor together,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
not crossing your
legs and you want

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.235 align:middle line:90%
to give this time to yourself.

00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:90%
We worry so much about the past.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:90%
The past has already happened.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Why do we worry
about the future?

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:90%
The future is yet to be.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So all you have is
this moment now.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So just be mindful of
living in this moment now.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And as you become
aware of the body

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:84%
just turn your awareness
inside the body.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Be very, very aware of your
beautiful heart beating

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:84%
just pumping the blood
throughout the body to feed

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:90%
the body, to nurture the body.

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of the
inside of the body

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.035 align:middle line:84%
as if you're on a
journey, a voyage

00:12:22.035 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of that body.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful cells
moving, reproducing.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
The light that's
within that body

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful golden
light of the spirit

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:90%
within every single body.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Just place your
awareness and your mind

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful light which
is imbued inside your body,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
inside the physical
body is your spirit.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The spirit body is
a body of light.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So just place that
awareness in your mind.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
ask you now to take

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:90%
a few deep breaths with me.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale, imagine
a beautiful golden light

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
coming down from
the ethers straight

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to the top of your head and
going right through the body

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.570 align:middle line:84%
touching every cell, every
muscle, and every organ.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:18.086 align:middle line:84%
Illuminating them with that
beautiful heavenly light.

00:13:18.086 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And as we exhale
out of the mouth,

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
we're going to let go of a
grey mist which represents

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the old ways of thinking,
our limitations of the mind,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:90%
our fears.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Going to let that
go out of our space

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and replace it that beautiful
golden light of heaven.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So together let's bring
in with that breath

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
the inhalation through the nose
that beautiful golden light

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and inhale and hold
it two three four

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and exhale out of the mouth.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And then hold it two
three four and exhale.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.782 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And just one more time and
inhale hold it two three four

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and exhale.
Good.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.866 align:middle line:84%
Now you're opening yourself
up to the core of your being,

00:14:22.866 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to the realization
that you are first

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and foremost a spiritual being
having a physical experience.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And now in your mind's
eye in that screen

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
above your head,
that vision I want

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to imagine a beautiful garden.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful, spiritual garden
with green, green meadows

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of grass as far as
the eyes can see

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with trees, and flowers
of all different colors

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and shapes and sizes.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Daffodils and tulips, roses
anything you want to create

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:90%
in your spirit garden.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:84%
See how beautiful
how rich how luscious

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
these colors are, this
prana, the energy of life.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And just become aware of this
beautiful, spiritual garden

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:90%
that you create with your mind.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
and exhale and as you

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
see this beautiful
garden, there is

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.276 align:middle line:84%
a bench sitting right in
the middle of that garden

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:90%
a nice marble bench.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's go now and sit
on that marble bench

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and just feel all the
energy of this garden.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The colors of the
flowers, the life source

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:84%
flowing through all,
you are connected

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
to every blade of grass,
every leaf on every tree.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Just feel the oneness
that you're a part of.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you feel this
completedness this oneness

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.450 align:middle line:84%
with this world around
you, standing behind you

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:84%
at this bench a being of
light one of your guides

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:84%
comes close, invite
them into your space.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Invite your guide
close behind you

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps touch
your shoulders.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of what
they feel like, become

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
aware of their
love, their energy

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
that you are able
to identify them.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Invite them to be closer
to you and folding

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:84%
themselves around so you
truly feel this guide.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you let them come in,
talk to them with your mind,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:90%
with your thoughts.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Send out a thought saying
give me a message dear guide,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.340 align:middle line:84%
let me hear what you
have to say to me.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.606 align:middle line:90%
Listen with your mind.

00:16:57.606 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
At the same time we give
gratitude to this lovely guide,

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
one of many guides
but this one steps

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:90%
forward to be with you today.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And thank them.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude is the right attitude.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So feel their energy thank
them for being with you,

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and just acknowledge
with your guide

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
a sign that they
give you how will

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:90%
you know when they're with you?

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Let them give you a sign.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you'll feel to touch on
your shoulder, wind upon you,

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.440 align:middle line:84%
whatever sign they want to
give you personally that you

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:90%
know this guide is with you.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.497 align:middle line:90%
Let them do that now.

00:17:38.497 --> 00:17:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And thank them and bless them.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And let them back
up now behind you,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.165 align:middle line:84%
take a step back and
just feel their love.

00:17:53.165 --> 00:17:57.730 align:middle line:84%
feel their love,
feel their love.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath and
exhale and bring your awareness

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
back to your body, your feet
on the floor, your legs,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
your backs in the chairs, your
arms, your neck, you head.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And one more breath to
make sure totally back

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and inhale and exhale.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:90%
How was That You enjoy that?

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Anybody have a new
experience seeing a new guide

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that they never knew
they had before?

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you did?

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm very curious to
hear who your guide

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:90%
was this time around.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure who it was but it
was definitely a female energy

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:90%
it was very loving.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
I felt enveloped in
this love and I did

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:90%
get a sign of what to look for.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Perfect, perfect.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, what is
your first name?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.099 align:middle line:90%
Deb.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Deb, so I'm going to tell
you right now your vibration,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the energy that I get from
you is very much a healer.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
green around you.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Now the heal that came in
for you was very, very much

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I call them a minister
of the healing,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:90%
minister of the healing angels.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know that as I
communicate with one of you

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
this guide stands
right here with you,

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel more of an
angelic feeling

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
want to ask you,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
would you know about having
angels around your house

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
or something about the angel
or work with angelic kingdom

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:90%
at all with your work?

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Well it felt like
an angel actually.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: It felt like an angel.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:90%
It felt like an angel,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And do you do work
where you work with the angels,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
where you work with a
higher level of energy

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.500 align:middle line:84%
because I feel a
lot of this energy

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.286 align:middle line:84%
is being brought down to you.
-I may.

00:19:40.286 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I am a healer.
JAMES: You are?

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.160 align:middle line:90%
That is my work.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Thank you and I'm just
acknowledging that with you.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
that you're a great scholar

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
in some ways and that one
of your philosopher guides

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:90%
is a scholar.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Very much around
obviously writing

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:90%
books and that sort of thing.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And I see the scrolls
of yesteryear.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know the
parchment scrolls,

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:84%
it's just very, very interesting
and so I don't know if that

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:90%
would make sense to you.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:90%
But that's what I'm seeing.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It would actually.
JAMES: OK.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's just
acknowledgement for you

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that this would be
a guide of yours.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Because that parchment paper
I really want to tell you

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:90%
that that's his home for you,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes
JAMES: Understand?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.079 align:middle line:84%
Yes I do understand
JAMES: OK.

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.478 align:middle line:84%
Good, good.
OK, great.

00:20:14.478 --> 00:20:15.889 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much.
-Yes

00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.091 align:middle line:84%
Can I just ask is the angel
guide and the parchment guide--

00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:22.494 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: The same
-Oh they're the same.

00:20:22.494 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: I think they're the same.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they're
the same but I

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.325 align:middle line:84%
do feel you have a
whole minister of I

00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:28.625 align:middle line:84%
don't want to say
angels around you who

00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:90%
do healing work through you.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
They use you as the healing
rays come through to you.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Now you would have to
notice that your hands become

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.211 align:middle line:84%
very hot sometimes because
they come through your hands

00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.671 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
heat that pulsate.

00:20:41.671 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
You understand

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.130 align:middle line:84%
-That?
-Yes.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.829 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:20:43.829 --> 00:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
One of my intentions that I've
said for well over a decade

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:90%
is I am a helper of angels.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:90%
Wow, there you go.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Well they heard you and
they're working with you.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you sweetheart.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Great, great and over here
we had somebody who-- yes,

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.764 align:middle line:84%
who might have
received something yes?

00:21:00.764 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
All right I of
course have my mom

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
but behind her I had two
other people that were there

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.760 align:middle line:90%
that I don't really recognize.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.901 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You didn't
recognize them?

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
What was a feeling you received
from those two other people

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:90%
that were behind you?

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Just acknowledge-- it
gets intense whenever

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I let my mom in so that was--

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
put it to the side.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.363 align:middle line:84%
I know she's here but we're
going to put it to the side so

00:21:22.363 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:90%
let's give her space.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But I want you have the
fullness of this experience

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.321 align:middle line:84%
so I want to just to--
what is your name?

00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Jason
JAMES: Jason.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So Jason I just want you to get
a sense of what does it feel

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
like to have another
guide come through.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
On an emotional level what
did that feel like for you?

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.323 align:middle line:84%
MALE AUDIENCE
MEMBER:I don't know.

00:21:37.323 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Very, very grounding
JAMES: Grounding.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Love that, love that.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:90%
We have to have grounding.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.144 align:middle line:84%
That believe it or not now when
your mom passed over which I'm

00:21:45.144 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
going to get to her in a
second because she really

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.501 align:middle line:84%
wants to speak but you really
kind of were out of your body

00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.840 align:middle line:84%
You pop out of your
body all the time

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.354 align:middle line:84%
I know you do need
grounding and you

00:21:53.354 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:90%
need to be part of the earth.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Understand that?

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of it so
that is part of it so.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm a dreamer, I'm
a dreamer a lot.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.040 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: You're a dreamer.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:90%
You're not a Pisces, are you?

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.629 align:middle line:84%
I could just tell by the
energy that's around you,

00:22:05.629 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the Piscean energy around you.
-Yeah

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And you're definitely
part of that sensitivity

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and the Pisces rules
you know the psychic,

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
so you are very psychic,
you're very sensitive.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
something here as well.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
That when your mom passed
away and, I'm would you

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:19.830 align:middle line:84%
mind if I bring her right
through here because I have

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
to because she's coming in.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's stepping in right
here and I'm going to let her

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:90%
come through further, come on.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But as she adjusts
to the energy here,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I just want to let
you know and I feel

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
her energy is very
emotional with this lady,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:90%
extremely emotional.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
you're very sensitive

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and you also are a healer
which is very, very

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.090 align:middle line:90%
interesting that you're here.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
You're very, very psychic,
you're very sensitive

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and your soul picked this out.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Your soul picked this
lifetime before you came back

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.921 align:middle line:84%
with your mom, with your dad,
with your siblings, picked it

00:22:45.921 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to
say how could that be?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you something which

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who are watching
I want you to hear this.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.737 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:53.737 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:90%
It's really important.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cry.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It's really important that
you know that's sometimes

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:84%
a loved one has to pass over
the world the spirit in order

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill your destiny.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't
fulfill your destiny

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:90%
without your mom passing over.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I couldn't
have made it this far.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.944 align:middle line:84%
OK now mom's
coming through here

00:23:09.944 --> 00:23:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and I want to talk about
something as she comes through.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I feel a very loving
woman, extremely loving

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
although she's telling
me that sometimes she

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.174 align:middle line:84%
was self-destructive as well.
-Yes

00:23:19.174 --> 00:23:20.639 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Understand that?
OK.

00:23:20.639 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Are you a sister of hers or are
you a relative of his mother?

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I am his grandmother
and I'm her mother.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You know this lady?
You're her mother.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Great.
Would you mind standing also?

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:90%
So you could say yes or no.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:84%
You can hold the
microphone, that's fine.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So I know that this lady as
she comes in here to me this

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:90%
would be your daughter.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:84%
I know that she is
apologizing, she's apologizing

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and I know there must
have been a time when

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
she was a young lady
that she left home.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So either around 19 years
of age or 20 years of age

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
if she just ran away
and didn't want anyone

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
know where she was,
makes sense to you?

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Hold the microphone then.
-Yes.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It makes good sense.
JAMES: It makes sense to you.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.909 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:55.304 align:middle line:84%
Because as she
comes into my mind

00:23:55.304 --> 00:23:56.770 align:middle line:84%
she's giving me this
sense that when she was

00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is 19, 20 years old she left the
family, left everything behind.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.774 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
be there, she said.

00:24:01.774 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be there.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to
explore life, she

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:90%
wanted to find out about life.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.849 align:middle line:84%
Your name is Jason again?
-Yes

00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Jason so she comes
in really strong for you

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and really, really
strong you're her baby,

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:84%
you'll always be
your baby, she said.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And she's calling
you her baby and I

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.721 align:middle line:84%
know that she used to refer to
you as her baby, is that right?

00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.356 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Because I know
when she comes in she

00:24:22.356 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:90%
refers to you as her baby.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
She also said to me
when were a young boy

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and around 7, 8 years of
age you used to do artwork,

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.831 align:middle line:84%
you used to do drawings
and paints and colors.

00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember that?
-Yes

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You used to
be all by yourself,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.190 align:middle line:84%
you used to be in a
way lonely but you

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
really weren't
lonely because inside

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.314 align:middle line:84%
you wanted to be by yourself.
-Right

00:24:37.314 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Understand that?

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.927 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:38.927 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I understand that,
I understand that.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Got you thank you
mom, thank you.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.370 align:middle line:84%
She said she's thanking
you, she's thanking you

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and she's thank you for
looking at her with non

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:90%
judgment, non judgment.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted I just get
her I get her, get her.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.821 align:middle line:84%
I know that you look at
my photo on the cellphone

00:24:56.821 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
JAMES: Do you understand that?

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You were looking at-- you
have my photo on the cell phone

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's when I
looked good she said.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:90%
She did

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] go on.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's a
couple songs that you

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
play for your mother as well.
-Yes

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And I know that you must
have transferred when she had

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
her cell phone and you
took her information

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and put it onto your cellphone.
-Yes.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Do you understand that?

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.114 align:middle line:84%
Certain songs or
something like that?

00:25:21.114 --> 00:25:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
JAMES: Photos you kept.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I could tell you
this she's going on about,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
she's with you also in
front of the computer

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and if I see the
desktop the image

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.206 align:middle line:84%
that you have on your computer
I see something with your mom.

00:25:32.206 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:84%
OK?
-OK

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.720 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Does that make
sense to you, please?

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.419 align:middle line:90%
Yes

00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, because I keep on
seeing images of your mother

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
on the computer almost like
a screensaver type thing.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.031 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:41.930 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: You understand that?

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.550 align:middle line:84%
We have a couple
pictures of her.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Because she said she pops
up on that computer screen.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's how she says it.
-Yeah

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
She's got I'm going to
tell you something also.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Did she at one point
go away to rehab

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:90%
or go to you understand that?

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.330 align:middle line:90%
She went quite a few times.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Yes OK thank you.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know that some point in
times it didn't work for her.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.800 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel that this lady, again
I get very emotional with her,

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and I need to let you know
that you're being here

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.301 align:middle line:84%
today is helping to heal her.
-Nice

00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:12.600 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Do you understand that?
-Yes.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: That I need
to let you both know

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and other family members
who were going to be here,

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.430 align:middle line:84%
that your being here today has
helped her because she feels

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
the love that you came
here out of love for her

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and she wants to
thank you for that.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.147 align:middle line:84%
And I know you wrote letters
to me when I was away.

00:26:27.147 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:84%
You wrote letters to me
when she was in rehab.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
She said you wrote her letters.
Do you understand that?

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.616 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And I know that you
still have some of those letters

00:26:32.616 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:90%
that you wrote her.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:84%
You actually have
them and I know

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
they're either in
a drawer or a box

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
you'd have some of
these letters, correct?

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
A box.
JAMES: OK.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know that as I open up
this letter she shows me very

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
clearly if I turn that letter
over I could see signature,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
love, and I'm seeing
hearts and x and o's.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.737 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:48.737 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Do you remember that?

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.509 align:middle line:84%
Place that for me please.
Great.

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:90%
 It's in an old box in my room.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.000 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Perfect, perfect and I
know that there comes with so

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:90%
much love that feeling of that.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Was she married twice?

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Were there are two
relationships in her life?

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:90%
There were two relationships.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Significant
relationships?

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.877 align:middle line:84%
Did she have children of both
relationships or was it--

00:27:04.877 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE AUDIENCE
MEMBER: Just Jason

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Just you OK, OK
but I don't know

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
if the other relationship
she had there

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:90%
was somebody, Step children.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so sorry she lost one.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: She lost one.
OK.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you, Kim.
-Oh

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.599 align:middle line:84%
This is her sister.
-Oh the sister.

00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:17.474 align:middle line:90%
Oh the sister is here too.

00:27:17.474 --> 00:27:19.239 align:middle line:84%
So you understand a lot of this?
SISTER: Oh, yes.

00:27:19.239 --> 00:27:20.990 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: OK now I
also want to tell you

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to
move on, I understand that.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I understand that.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you she's
with her mother as well.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about
mother and mother as well.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.677 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you the
mother has a lovely rose garden

00:27:30.677 --> 00:27:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and I know that when
you were meditating

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:84%
you kept seeing roses and
kept on seeing flowers.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.290 align:middle line:84%
You understand about the
roses you kept on seeing?

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:84%
I did and I thought it
was my grandmother but--

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: There you go.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:90%
I did see them.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:84%
One more thing, then I'm
going to move on here.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.887 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
two things OK.

00:27:44.887 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I got your mother
is very pushy here.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%
She's finds herself.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:90%
She's finding herself.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
She's finally
finding herself and I

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.757 align:middle line:90%
got to tell you that as well.

00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank all
of you for helping me,

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:84%
she's talking about and this
for her is therapy right here.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You are not your mother.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.900 align:middle line:90%
You are not your mother.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't think you're going
to have a drug problem.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Don't think you're going to have
an alcoholism because she said

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:90%
that he's worrying about that.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:90%
He's worrying about that.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:90%
He's worrying about that.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.869 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense?
-Yes.

00:28:08.869 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You're not your mom.
You understand that?

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:84%
You will not end
up like your mom.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:90%
You won't.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.600 align:middle line:84%
You are here today
and because you're

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
here today you
have an awareness,

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.229 align:middle line:84%
do you understand that?
-Yes

00:28:19.229 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And that sensitivity you
can work with that sensitivity

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.861 align:middle line:84%
and build it up and be the
creative wonderful person

00:28:23.861 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You're not your mom and
you've done everything

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:90%
for your mom you could have.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:10%
So don't think you didn't do
anything, You understand that?

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah.
JAMES: God bless you.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you guys with that.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.576 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:28:34.576 --> 00:28:39.889 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I got to tell you
that as I stand up here

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very conscious of a
brown dog that's coming to me.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a short-haired
dog, it's a darker

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
brown than a lighter brown
is almost like a copper

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:90%
brown color.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I know there
was rather there was an incision

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
where there's a procedure
done to this dog

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was before
he passes over.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.625 align:middle line:90%
Maybe over here or here.

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Is it you?

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say before
I come to that my leg

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.974 align:middle line:84%
was definitely affected here and
my insides here were affected.

00:29:08.974 --> 00:29:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't know if
there was an incision

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that was made that I feel there
might have been at one point.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Having a tumor or
something as well

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure where I
am, Does make sense to you?

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense you?

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
OK sweetheart your name is?
-Grace

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, Grace do you understand
about the dog that

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
comes here and did
this dog you understand

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:84%
about having a procedure done
before the do passed away.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
She had like a tumor and
she couldn't walk very well.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.120 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: She couldn't
walk and didn't

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.127 align:middle line:84%
you carry this dog sometimes?
-Yes.

00:29:34.127 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: So you understand
about the carrying

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and didn't you wrap a
blanket-- I have a blanket

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:39.810 align:middle line:84%
at one point the dog--
-I think so.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And didn't at one time this
dog I want to lick your face

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.760 align:middle line:90%
so I want to lick your face.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And I know this dog was
known for licking your face.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I also know this dog
impresses upon me

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that there was a picture, a
photograph of the dog with you.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So I know that the doge
would be like either

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.659 align:middle line:84%
kissing you in that photograph.
I would believe so.

00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean there's tons.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.894 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: OK so I know it's
a silver frames so you'll

00:29:58.894 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:90%
have to go look at that, OK.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:03.891 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you kept
the collar or the name tag,

00:30:03.891 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you kept the--
-Somehow

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.280 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: OK, I know
it's in a drawer

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and I know this dog is thanking
you and very grateful for you.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I know that you had to
sacrifice a lot for the dog

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and I know that this
dog wants to thank

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:84%
you very much for giving
the love that you did.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.071 align:middle line:84%
And didn't you get
another one after him?

00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Two.
JAMES: You had two more.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The dog that's coming
through after him,

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:90%
was that dog rescued?

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Or something that you
were given this dog?

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:84%
MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER:
The first dog.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:90%
The first dog.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she was yeah.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: She was
rescued, wasn't she?

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:84%
OK
-I think so.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of love
there from the dog.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank you from
the dog and one more thing.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're
putting a scrapbook

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.431 align:middle line:84%
where you have photographs
all together somewhere.

00:30:35.431 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And there would
be one page or something

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and they're all together and
this dog is part of that.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.127 align:middle line:84%
The dog can run
again and it's happy

00:30:43.127 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and it keeps on licking so
I've just got to give you that.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.075 align:middle line:84%
-Awesome.
-OK?

00:30:46.075 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:84%
-Thank you.
-All right, sweetheart.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.254 align:middle line:90%
Did your dad pass over?

00:30:53.254 --> 00:30:54.120 align:middle line:90%
MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
He's standing right behind you
and I just want to come to you.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're here
today to talk to your father

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:84%
because I know he
just said that to me.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.970 align:middle line:84%
He said my son is here
and wants to speak with me

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:90%
and I want to speak to you.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And would you mind if
I bring you up on stage

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and do a reading here on stage?

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sure.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Sure, he's a good sport.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.291 align:middle line:84%
What is your name?
-Mike.

00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Mike want to have a
seat right over here.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.767 align:middle line:90%
OK Mike?

00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
that away from you.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Do we need this anymore?
No.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
a real microphone.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.125 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Mike what I want to do
is I want to have you on stage

00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
but I want you to
use these cards.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.264 align:middle line:84%
I created these cards and
these are the medium ship cards

00:31:28.264 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and what I want you
to do is just hold

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:90%
on to these cards, Mike.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you to do
is I want to shuffle them

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and I want to put
your energy, I want

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:84%
you to feel your energy
going into those cards

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.376 align:middle line:84%
and imbuing your
energy in those cards.

00:31:39.376 --> 00:31:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Feel those cards
with your energy.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.181 align:middle line:84%
But just all around that's
great, great, great, great.

00:31:46.181 --> 00:31:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Just keep on.
-Card shuffle, or--?

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Card shuffle, that's all right.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
keep on holding them

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and just play
around them and just

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:90%
feel the energy from your dad.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:84%
You dad is standing
right next to you.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Your dad is right
to your left side.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And as you just work
with those cards,

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you in your mind to send
a question out to your father.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Send a question at your father.
OK?

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And then when you feel
right I want you just

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to spread those cards in the
table here, like tarot cards

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.610 align:middle line:90%
but they're different.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to
think of a question

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.201 align:middle line:84%
and spread out the
cards on the table.

00:32:19.201 --> 00:32:19.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you're done
spreading them out,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and when you feel as if you have
the right card for the answer

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
that your father wants to
give you, just pull the card

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:90%
they really want to go to.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
OK now before you look at the
card, pull the one-- that's one

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.179 align:middle line:84%
speaks to?
Great.

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:38.530 align:middle line:84%
What is the question that
you had for your dad?

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not he forgives
me for not being there

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:90%
when he passed away.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:90%
OK and what does the card say?

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Now I have no pain.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.164 align:middle line:90%
Now I have no pain.

00:32:49.164 --> 00:32:50.646 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:50.646 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So I want to let you
know that your father is

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.550 align:middle line:90%
right standing there.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.401 align:middle line:84%
Were you separated as far as
geographically separated--

00:32:56.401 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:84%
-Yes
-With your dad?

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.335 align:middle line:84%
But your father's
a very strong man

00:32:59.335 --> 00:33:01.314 align:middle line:84%
and now your dad
is a New Yorker.

00:33:01.314 --> 00:33:02.580 align:middle line:84%
(New York Accent)
I've got to tell you

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I got a very New York
feeling, right here

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:90%
is a very, very New York.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.750 align:middle line:90%
OK

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:07.449 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:33:07.449 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
He really calls it what
it is and he doesn't

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:90%
let anyone suffer fools.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean he's really in your face.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you that I feel
from a very young age he tries

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:84%
to get things done in his own
way, creating his own business,

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:90%
doing his own type of thing.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm early in my and
I feel like your dad

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.760 align:middle line:84%
really, really got a
hold of his own life

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.187 align:middle line:84%
and really had to work hard
when he was a young boy.

00:33:28.187 --> 00:33:29.819 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense to you?
-Yes.

00:33:29.819 --> 00:33:32.035 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember I keep
on getting your dad--

00:33:32.035 --> 00:33:32.935 align:middle line:90%
did you ever know Rockaway?

00:33:32.935 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You know Rockaway?
-Yes.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Would that makes sense.
I' m getting--

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-Rockaway in my head.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:90%
What is Rockaway?

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Rockaway Beach in Brooklyn.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:90%
He grew up in Brooklyn.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.700 align:middle line:90%
He grew up in Brooklyn?

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect perfect.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.400 align:middle line:84%
So I know there was something
to do with Rockaway, Rockaway

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.793 align:middle line:84%
beach of Rockaway
Boulevard, whatever

00:33:46.793 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
it is but I know
he had a home there

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:90%
would be connected with that.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.334 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got to ask you, was
there diabetes then at the end?

00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if there was blood
sugar and diabetes problems?

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:90%
He did have a problem with it.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Thank very
much because he

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.271 align:middle line:84%
gives me a feeling of being
diabetic or having some issues

00:33:59.271 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I also know that he
couldn't breathe at the end

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:84%
so your father
gives me a feeling

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.230 align:middle line:90%
of not being able to breathe.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know you either
have to be on oxygen

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like
pulmonary problems.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand that?
-Yes

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:09.710 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Yes, OK.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
Now would you remember
your grandmother?

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Oh, yeah.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.831 align:middle line:84%
Would you remember if she used
to have the roll-up stockings?

00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:16.530 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-[LAUGHING]

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.520 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.557 align:middle line:84%
Because she has roll-up
stockings when she comes in.

00:34:23.557 --> 00:34:24.290 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: I remember that.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's always using
our hands like this.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
-Yes.
-That's how she's using a hands.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.699 align:middle line:84%
She's playing with
her hands like this.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
She's like wringing
out her hands

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and you would know
her from that.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.193 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You know you
don't do anything

00:34:34.193 --> 00:34:36.580 align:middle line:84%
wrong with your grandma You
can do anything with her.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Sit on the stoop.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Sit on the stoop.
MIKE: I remember that, too.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.860 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You remember
sitting on the stoop.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:90%
She's using the word stoop.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:90%
They had to sit on the stoop.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.112 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't behave
yourself when you were kids,

00:34:45.112 --> 00:34:46.645 align:middle line:84%
you got out of the house
and sit on the stoop.

00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Uh huh.
Yep.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Remember that?

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:84%
OK she's giving me this really,
really strong vibe of that

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.377 align:middle line:90%
and your father's with her.

00:34:53.377 --> 00:34:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you also, I feel

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.460 align:middle line:90%
his father around him as well.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And I need to let you know that
your grandfather, his father

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:84%
was not someone who really
could show his feelings

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:90%
and show his emotions.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he's
not as sensitive

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:90%
as I would have liked.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you
him and your father

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I feel they're getting
better, they're

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.610 align:middle line:84%
getting better along now--
-Good.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.223 align:middle line:90%
Than they did in a lifetime.

00:35:13.223 --> 00:35:14.190 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: That's good.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.230 align:middle line:84%
OK and I've just
got to give you that.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.641 align:middle line:84%
Who was the other Michael
or Mike in the family?

00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:20.340 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: My son.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.130 align:middle line:84%
OK because I want to give
love to the other Mike,

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Michael and I've got
to tell you that.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And do go to baseball games?

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you used to go to
baseball games all the time?

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:28.709 align:middle line:84%
With my dad, yes.
JAMES: With you dad?

00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I get a very strong
feeling here from him

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.595 align:middle line:84%
that we used to throw
the baseball games,

00:35:32.595 --> 00:35:34.250 align:middle line:84%
we used to enjoy
the games together.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your father
taught you how to keep score.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes he did.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes he did.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.000 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: He's telling me he helped
you with how to keep score

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.786 align:middle line:90%
and that's really amazing.

00:35:43.786 --> 00:35:45.160 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: Wow.
JAMES: You remember that?

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.925 align:middle line:90%
You have that memory, don't you?

00:35:46.925 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: So those memories
Mike are still alive.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It was a long time
ago but I remember.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: They're still alive and
I know it's a big deal when

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:90%
they first got a dishwasher.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're right.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.884 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:35:58.884 --> 00:36:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Well back then they
didn't have dishwashers.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:01.920 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: They didn't
have dishwashers

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and it was a big deal.

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And now he's showing
me linoleum flooring,

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.320 align:middle line:84%
some linoleum flooring.
-Yeah

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.695 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk--
go on, go on, go on.

00:36:08.695 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:12.131 align:middle line:84%
I love your wife so your
wife-- is your wife here?

00:36:12.131 --> 00:36:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Because you knew
his father didn't you?

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Because he wants to thank
you for everything and I

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
understand that yes I
understand that your wife

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:90%
tends to live in the past.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't live in the past,
you can't change the past.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Things have happened and
things can't be the same,

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.240 align:middle line:90%
you understand that?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you
can't make things be

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.570 align:middle line:90%
the way they were in the past.

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:36.910 align:middle line:90%
You can't change the past.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:39.040 align:middle line:84%
I know that you and your
wife have been through a lot.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.615 align:middle line:90%
I know that, I know you have.

00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I also know there was a
child that passes over.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure-- do
you understand this?

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
JAMES: And I know that--

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.530 align:middle line:84%
My daughter passed away.
JAMES: Pardon me?

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.380 align:middle line:84%
My--
JAMES: Daughter?

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah I know that he
brings her with him.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.290 align:middle line:84%
He brings her with him here
and I know-- I understand that

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing bows,
bows, bows, bows.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:84%
OK and I know that she's
right here with you,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.270 align:middle line:90%
she's right here with you.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:84%
When she crosses over by
the way, I'm gone fast.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:06.774 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone quickly.

00:37:06.774 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to know
that I'm gone quickly.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel a
thing and I want you

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:90%
to know I did not feel a thing.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:12.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
she's an angel of yours

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and I know you refer to her now
as my little angel or my angel,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.020 align:middle line:90%
is that right?

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Yeah.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:20.050 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And if I
go to your house,

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
she brings me my mind to your
house she's also a guide,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:84%
OK I'm sorry, she's also a
guide of yours, you know that.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Could I just tell you something
about a piano around you?

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
OK so I want you to pay
attention to this please,

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:90%
please, please.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
When you go and see a piano
and this is really funny,

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
she has a quirky sense of humor.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.363 align:middle line:84%
When you go to a
certain place, I

00:37:39.363 --> 00:37:40.996 align:middle line:84%
don't know whether it's
an airport or wheter it's

00:37:40.996 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:90%
a hotel, [INAUDIBLE] piano.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And the keys are
playing by themselves,

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You know one of those
automated pianos.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Would you keep your eyes
out for that because she's

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:90%
laughing about it.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:84%
She says I'm going
to bring you there

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to see that it's

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.130 align:middle line:90%
me who is taking you there.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:53.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And don't you still have a chain
of hers, a necklace of hers

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:90%
Don't you have a necklace?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.466 align:middle line:90%
Are you wearing her necklace?

00:37:59.466 --> 00:38:00.914 align:middle line:84%
You have it with you?
I mean, you have it?

00:38:00.914 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I've got a ring that's hers.
JAMES: You have a ring.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And what about the necklace?

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a necklace that
belonged to her as well.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.771 align:middle line:84%
I've got a necklace but
it's back in Illinois.

00:38:06.771 --> 00:38:07.470 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: That's fine.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You have a necklace
of mine, she said.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
You have a necklace of mine.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.310 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you she's
in a happy space now.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.314 align:middle line:90%
She's not a bad space.

00:38:15.314 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.501 align:middle line:84%
And your dad is the one that
brought her through here.

00:38:18.501 --> 00:38:19.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Where you live right
now, is there a garage

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:90%
anywhere where you live?

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.770 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: I keep on seeing
that something in the garage

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.047 align:middle line:84%
and you boxes,
boxes, boxes, boxes.

00:38:28.047 --> 00:38:29.480 align:middle line:84%
MIKE'S WIFE: Well we're
in the other house.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.580 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: You're in
the other house?

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.427 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the house in Illinois is
full of boxes in the garage.

00:38:33.427 --> 00:38:35.260 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: She keeps on showing
me these boxes in a garage.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:90%
, Boxes, boxes.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.094 align:middle line:84%
And some of her things
are in those boxes.

00:38:39.094 --> 00:38:39.960 align:middle line:90%
MIKE'S WIFE: Yes they are.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Yes they are.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of things are
in those boxes.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Because you have my things the
boxes and OK and I know also

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:90%
do you have rings of hers?

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Not just one but you have
several rings that belonged

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to her, do you understand that?

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know she's
talking about that.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I know she comes to
your ear all the time

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and speaks into your ear.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And you think is at her or not?

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that her or not?

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Your dad, he's with her.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.690 align:middle line:90%
He's with her.

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:06.707 align:middle line:84%
Yeah and I've got to tell
you that so take his love

00:39:06.707 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and your daughter's love.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:90%
She's always with you.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want you to--
I don't want your wife

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.927 align:middle line:84%
to say that she could have
saved her or helped her

00:39:14.927 --> 00:39:15.960 align:middle line:90%
and feel like she didn't do it.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.230 align:middle line:84%
She was on our own path--
MIKE: I know.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And that was the way it was.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.431 align:middle line:84%
And she had to-- her soul had
to go through the journey.

00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:23.240 align:middle line:84%
You know that.
MIKE: I know, I know.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: And you're a great dad.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.280 align:middle line:90%
You're a great dad.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Can I tell you also that
you're teaching your father.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching your father
another side of life,

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.970 align:middle line:90%
how to be a good father.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.621 align:middle line:84%
OK and I've got to tell you
that and a lot of love from him.

00:39:36.621 --> 00:39:38.675 align:middle line:84%
All right, Mike?
I'll leave you with that, OK?

00:39:38.675 --> 00:39:39.617 align:middle line:84%
God bless you.
God

00:39:39.617 --> 00:39:41.075 align:middle line:84%
[APPLAUSE]
-Thank you.

00:39:41.075 --> 00:39:42.746 align:middle line:84%
All right, my friend?
Yeah, give me a hug.

00:39:42.746 --> 00:39:44.204 align:middle line:90%
We do hugs.

00:39:44.204 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sir

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.130 align:middle line:84%
OK so this is really
interesting because many times

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:84%
when I do a message or
reading for somebody

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.840 align:middle line:84%
the person at the time does
not fully understand what

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:90%
the spirit is trying to say.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:02.050 align:middle line:84%
The references or the names, and
I swear it happens all the time

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:04.400 align:middle line:84%
where later they leave
the studio in driving

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.450 align:middle line:84%
home from a meeting,
they go oh my gosh

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:07.820 align:middle line:90%
that's my mother's name.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:90%
So it happens all the time.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I know you two really,
really, really worked hard

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.780 align:middle line:84%
with them or understood the
reference with your grandmother

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.040 align:middle line:90%
with those rolled up stockings.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.760 align:middle line:84%
She used to have
rolled-up stockings.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.170 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: And that's how
you would know her.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:22.194 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Absolutely.

00:40:22.194 --> 00:40:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Great, great,
great, great, great,

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know do you
feel your daughters presence,

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:26.710 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.440 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: Yes.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.981 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: OK now I know that--
and what is your wife's name?

00:40:29.981 --> 00:40:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Colleen.
JAMES: Colleen.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Colleen, Colleen.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:90%
OK Colleen.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So Colleen, darling
what's your birthstone?

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.584 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:40:37.584 --> 00:40:40.074 align:middle line:90%
COLLEEN: I am-- [LAUGHS].

00:40:40.074 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:90%
You see, this is what I mean.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.506 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't that remember
when she was born.

00:40:42.506 --> 00:40:43.816 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.096 align:middle line:84%
COLLEEN: I remember when
I was born but for some

00:40:46.096 --> 00:40:47.270 align:middle line:90%
odd reason I can't--

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.699 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: What date?
What's the date?

00:40:48.699 --> 00:40:50.348 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Cancer.

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:51.287 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: You're the crab.

00:40:51.287 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:90%
COLLEEN: Thank you, I'm a crab.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.590 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: When's your birthday?

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:55.800 align:middle line:90%
MIKE: I'm a Pisces.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Oh, god, Pisces.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.097 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:41:02.097 --> 00:41:03.730 align:middle line:10%
COLLEEN: What is there
something wrong with that?

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.235 align:middle line:10%
It's fine.
Cancer, you're such a Cancer.

00:41:05.235 --> 00:41:07.001 align:middle line:84%
MIKE: That might be kind of new.
[LAUGHING]

00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:08.171 align:middle line:84%
Right, right.
I know things.

00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:08.870 align:middle line:90%
I do know things.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.400 align:middle line:84%
COLLEEN: But you
knew I was Cancer?

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.090 align:middle line:84%
No I just know the
certain elements

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.770 align:middle line:90%
of an energy around you.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:90%
COLLEEN: Uh huh.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: I just know that
something with you, Colleen.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I just want to tell
you that your family

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.190 align:middle line:90%
is very close to you.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.560 align:middle line:84%
That the family-- I want
my family to be close

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:90%
it means a lot to me, my family.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you something,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.281 align:middle line:84%
things don't always work out
the way you want them to.

00:41:28.281 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:84%
OK?
COLLEEN: This is true

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:31.510 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: So I know with you
that you're a control freak

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and I know--
COLLEEN: This is true.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.980 align:middle line:10%
that you want things--
there's a certain way with you

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:10%
and when they can't be
controlled it's like ugh!

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.980 align:middle line:10%
But guess what, Colleen?

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.750 align:middle line:10%
You don't have control.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.665 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: Nobody has control.

00:41:42.665 --> 00:41:44.370 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:10%
JAMES: Nobody has
control about what

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.320 align:middle line:10%
are people say, what
other people do,

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:10%
when somebody's soul
leaves this earth

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.320 align:middle line:10%
and goes through to
the other side of life.

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.670 align:middle line:10%
We don't have
control about that.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:10%
What we do have
control about is how we

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:10%
react to other people's words.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:02.540 align:middle line:10%
I often say how people
treat you is there karma,

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.070 align:middle line:10%
how you react is your karma.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Really important to know that.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So I want to know
with your daughter

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and with your family and your
father and all these people

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that you know what, you
have to let them be.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.964 align:middle line:10%
And we learn lessons
from them, you know?

00:42:15.964 --> 00:42:17.130 align:middle line:10%
You might learn a
lesson from them.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:10%
And.

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:18.660 align:middle line:10%
Please remember
that your daughter

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.530 align:middle line:10%
is a guide of yours as well.

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:21.950 align:middle line:10%
A personal guide of yours.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to know
that you're not alone.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.640 align:middle line:10%
No one is ever alone.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.430 align:middle line:10%
No one ever alone.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Could you ask her
a question for me?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.010 align:middle line:90%
JAMES: No, I'm done.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.970 align:middle line:90%
So I just want you to--

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.060 align:middle line:84%
COLLEEN: OK.
No control there.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:10%
No control.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I control how I'm
going to respond.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:10%
So you can ask her
though on your own.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:10%
You can ask and send out
a thought and receive it.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.090 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't doubt yourself.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.220 align:middle line:84%
COLLEEN: Well that was
kind of the question.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So when I sense her I think of
a cigarette smoke, like a smell.

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:84%
JAMES: Did she used
to smoke cigarettes?

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's the number
one way, that's

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
your connection
with your daughter

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:90%
who is a guide of yours.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So for all of you who want
to contact your guides,

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:84%
we talked about guides
and being with the guides.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.520 align:middle line:10%
A signal that you
get is something

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.070 align:middle line:10%
where there's a physical symbol,
a smell, a thing, an object.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Now for you two over here your
daughter is one of your guides,

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.210 align:middle line:84%
very much so and she comes
in with cigarette smell

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:90%
or a sense of the cigarettes.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.980 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
know she's around.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you want to talk
to your guides folks just

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.400 align:middle line:90%
send out a thought and listen.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.830 align:middle line:90%
Listen with the mind.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Let the mind be still
and ask your guide

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to come through to you and be
open to them and how they feel.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And how you feel when you
connect with your guide.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:84%
OK so I want to thank you
all very much for being here.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank everyone
at home that watched the show.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And may the love and
lighten of the spirit world

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.130 align:middle line:84%
be around you always.
Thank you very much.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:84%
We'll see you next time.
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Thank you everyone.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
Thank you.
