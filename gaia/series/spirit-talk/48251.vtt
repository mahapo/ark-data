00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, world-renowned
spirit medium James Van Praagh.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.445 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.680 align:middle line:90%
How are ya?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Can't hear ya.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.952 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me hear ya?

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:41.177 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for joining
me for Spirit Talk

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:84%
where I bring you one
step closer to heaven.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.214 align:middle line:84%
So it's my intention today,
I'm setting my intention

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
with everybody
watching, everybody

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:90%
here in this audience.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Lovely audience from all over
the place probably, yeah?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of you flew in from
I don't know, far away.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.892 align:middle line:90%
Like Denver?

00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:58.433 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it's
five minutes away.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I thought today we
would do a show about intention.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
like to know how come things

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:90%
don't appear in their life.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.970 align:middle line:84%
That they have a desire to
really work for and want

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
certain things and there are
other things they don't get.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they wonder why don't
they get those things

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:90%
that they think of.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.095 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to do a show about
intentions and manifestation.

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Manifesting what we
really want in life

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:90%
and why we can't manifest.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think that everybody
that's watching the show

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.290 align:middle line:84%
should maybe open up
their hearts and minds.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.999 align:middle line:84%
And everybody here
in the audience, too.

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Really the fact is-- I say
this every time on my show--

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that we are all spirits
having a human experience.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And just by that alone,
just by that awareness

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that we are spirit
first and foremost,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
we react to a whole
bunch of different types

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of laws, a different
way of living.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
It's really not what's going
on around us in the physical.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really what's happening
here within our hearts

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.524 align:middle line:90%
and in the mind.

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
People often ask me,
what is the spirit?

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, the mind is
part of the spirit.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The brain is part of
the physical body.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And what happens at death is
really the brain ceases to be.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But the mind continues
on, for the mind

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is part of the spirit, part
of the soul, if you will.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And within the mind, and
you'll find this out today,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that within that mind
is really a tapestry,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful painting,
if you will,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
of every single experience
you ever had on the earth.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Every single incident,
every single memory

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.207 align:middle line:90%
is really recorded in the mind.

00:02:25.207 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And when they pass into
the world of spirit,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
when people die, they pass
into that world of spirit.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So all the experiences
that we had on this earth,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
that we lived on this earth,
really do stay part of us

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
in the mind, a part of
the soul, if you will.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So when the spirit people tend
to come back and communicate

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
or attempt communication,
we really will--

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
they will come back
very close to my space.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:90%
The atmosphere around me.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And around you, by the way.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course because you are
calling them in, not me, right?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And many times when
they do communicate

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:84%
through me or through
another medium,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
they will first bring through
memories of their life.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like going
to an old childhood school

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.365 align:middle line:90%
that you graduated from.

00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:06.554 align:middle line:90%
A grade school perhaps.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come back
to memories that you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.751 align:middle line:90%
had at that grade school.

00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Different situations you
had, perhaps different people

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:90%
in your life at that time.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So when the spirits
come back, they

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
will tend to bring forth old
memories that they had in life.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.786 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as
time in the spirit world.

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Time is really only relative
here to this physical,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:90%
three dimensional world.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.400 align:middle line:90%
So they're outside of time.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So to them, they really
don't live in time.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:84%
They live in memories that
they created on the earth.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
So how do you like that?

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.162 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:03:34.162 --> 00:03:35.370 align:middle line:90%
I believe that we're all God.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're all that
beautiful, creative energy,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:90%
that creative force.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.005 align:middle line:84%
And God always is
manifesting and creating.

00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
sitting here in this audience

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:90%
is creating.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.654 align:middle line:84%
You may not be
conscious of it, you

00:03:46.654 --> 00:03:48.070 align:middle line:84%
might not be
conscious of yourself

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:90%
creating and manifesting things.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:90%
But you are on another level.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got to tell you
that you being spirit,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.189 align:middle line:84%
you being God, that creative
force, that loving force,

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and God constantly creating
things over and over again.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.940 align:middle line:90%
We could have whatever we want.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:90%
For God says yes.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Then why is it that we
don't have what we want?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we
don't get what we want?

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.965 align:middle line:90%
Anybody know?

00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We don't allow.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.298 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We don't allow.

00:04:13.298 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.286 align:middle line:84%
We're not on that
frequency of allowing.

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So when we want something
to manifest in our lives,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.493 align:middle line:84%
so we put it out there,
let's say we visualize it,

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:90%
we meditate about manifestation.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And we could have that, if
we stay with that frequency.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.092 align:middle line:84%
Think of it like this, think
of it like a radio station.

00:04:28.092 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And that you're tuning
to a certain dial.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:90%
106.7, right?

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
You're on 106.7, or
you're tuning into that.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're really like
visualizing, I want this.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, I want
this type of job,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.497 align:middle line:84%
a type of relationship
in my life,

00:04:39.497 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I want this material
thing like a car.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is in your life.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And you're tuning into it.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's a part of you
which might not allow it.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what you're saying.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So if your vibratory rate,
and I'm just saying this,

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:90%
106.7 like a radio.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So if your frequency or
your vibratory rate is here.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.906 align:middle line:84%
But you're only
tuning it to 96.7,

00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to get it.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So you're not allowing
yourself to experience

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
the fullness of that vibration
of that vortex of coming

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:84%
into that oneness of being
and really into-- whether it's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
feelings of deserving,
feelings of guilt,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
feelings of limitation,
feelings of inadequacy,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:90%
whatever it might be.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:84%
You're exactly right,
you're not feeling

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
worthy at that
vibrational rate, yes.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to
manifest, materialize,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to be at
that frequency.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And the more one
has a relationship

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
with their true self,
their spiritual self,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual creative
being, and whether that's

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
done through disciplines
of meditation,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it's done through
contemplation and prayer,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.030 align:middle line:90%
whether it's done through yoga.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, however you
could quiet the mind

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and get to that space
of creative self

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
creative beings of God.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can accept
and allow ourselves

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:84%
to get to that higher
frequency and receive.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And really manifest whatever
we want in our lives.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:90%
So we really have the abundance.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.859 align:middle line:90%
It's within us.

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just having the awareness.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.955 align:middle line:84%
So we already have
the abundance,

00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
but it's having the
awareness to bring yourself

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
full to that experience,
to that manifestation.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So you could have
anything you want.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people don't
have what they want also

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.756 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
clear in their vision.

00:06:16.756 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
They're not very
clear in their vision.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world,
God, the creative self

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
will give us exactly
what we want.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what we want.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be very,
very clear in the vision

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.712 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to be exacting
to what you want.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine many
years ago, was very funny,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
she taught me about
visualization.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said, James,
it's the weirdest thing

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:90%
that I had happen to me.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:10%
I used to visualize
I'd be driving down

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:10%
Wilshire Boulevard in California
with a Mercedes convertible.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.939 align:middle line:10%
And I envisioned
everything about it.

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I envisioned the interior,
I envisioned the color

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of the car, I even envisioned
the radio station that

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
was playing, and the
music that was coming out.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And she said, and it was 12:15.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And she made this whole thing
up about 12:15 in the afternoon,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:84%
she was driving this nice
Mercedes, she had the color,

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and she felt the
wind on her hair,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:90%
she had the music on the radio.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So you'd think that she's
done her job, didn't she?

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't you think?

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Several years later, she
said it actually happened.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
She was driving down Wilshire
Boulevard in Los Angeles

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and she was looking and she
goes, oh my gosh, here it is.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:90%
This is like my visualization.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:90%
It's my manifestation.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I wanted a Mercedes.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly what I had
in my visualization.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a yellow Mercedes, which
is rare, I guess, right?

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:90%
A rare kind of color.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:84%
With a brown interior
and the song came on that

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
she was thinking about
in the visualization.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything was exactly right.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at the
clock, it was 12:15,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.730 align:middle line:84%
there was a light wind, and
she was like, oh my god,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.605 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly right.

00:07:46.605 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, so you had
your car that you wanted.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
You materialized that,
you manifested this car.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:90%
It was able to happen.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
kind of, yeah.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:90%
I said, what was the problem?

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
there was one thing

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I forgot when I tried
to manifest this car.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I was there, I
envisioned the space,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:90%
I envisioned everything I could.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:10%
Like exactly to the detail.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.860 align:middle line:90%
Except one important thing.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I said, what was that?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, I
did envision all that

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:90%
and I'm driving the car.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But she goes, it
dawned on me as I'm

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
driving this car down Wilshire
Boulevard and feeling the sun.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
That, gosh, this is part
of my visualization,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't do it right.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I was picking up my
car for my boss from the repair

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.211 align:middle line:90%
shop.

00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:90%
She didn't say it's for me.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So she left out of that
equation that it's for her.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:90%
She left that out.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So the universe gave her
exactly what she wanted.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what she wanted.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't say,
I own it, it's mine.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's very, very
important to do that.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So any other questions
you have about

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:84%
manifestations that
you might have?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.929 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: What if you
don't know what you want?

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What if
you don't want to create?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't know what
you want in manifestation?

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the number one thing is
you have to know what you want.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you desire?

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:90%
What do you want in your life?

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
very, very specific

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and detailed down to it.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So you can just
say, I want love.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'll have love.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to be more
specific in my visualization.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.392 align:middle line:84%
Remember that the spirit
world, that God, the creation

00:09:18.392 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
will always give
you what you want.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.599 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
clear with your vision.

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know
what you want.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it's not going to
be fully realized in detail.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Just like the story of
my friend with the car.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.195 align:middle line:84%
So you really have to
have a clear vision.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Even if you want
to write it down,

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
write things down as
far as the details

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and then project it out.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:90%
You have a question over here.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.376 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Would
manifestation be

00:09:42.376 --> 00:09:46.310 align:middle line:84%
pretty much like a sculptor
creating a sculpture intact?

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the
emotion, the spirit

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
is all ingrained into
the object and then

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
only after when it's completed,
he stands back and says,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.900 align:middle line:90%
this is what I really wanted.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In a way?

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In a way.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And I love the way
you described it.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can really create
that exactly like you said,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
which is much emotion behind it
and the desire that you want.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you want a certain
particular thing in your life,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:84%
a certain situation, a certain
scenario, a certain person,

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
a certain job, whatever
it is you want.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.460 align:middle line:84%
The more you can give it
the emotion behind it.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I often will
create this scenario in my mind

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:90%
where I want to be.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:26.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And I will feel
emotionally how I'm

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
going to be when
it's manifested.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So I will put myself
into that space

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:90%
as like I've received already.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look around, I'll see
who is in the room with me.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And what are they saying to me,
how I feel about the situation,

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.415 align:middle line:84%
and I even go further as what
is the weather like outside.

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.802 align:middle line:84%
I visualize picking
up my cell phone,

00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:52.343 align:middle line:84%
and someone's calling me, and
they're saying something to me.

00:10:52.343 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it
is, the scenario,

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:84%
you want to use as
much detail and emotion

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.380 align:middle line:84%
with the manifestation
as possible.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you will get it
exactly as you give it.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Now that being said, I
also have to tell you that

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and this is very, very true.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody here in this
audience has experienced this.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes just because
you want something,

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
does not mean you're
going to get it

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
the way you want it, right?

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying that
because sometimes you

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
will receive-- it's like
you get what you need,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:90%
not what you want.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Ego, self, and
the human self can

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:84%
have a certain desire
and that can help you.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
But your higher self will
always lead you the right path

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to get what you want.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But you certainly
can help promote that

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and manifest in your life what
you want by having that desire

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and having that
emotion for sure.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
when we do something

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:90%
that comes from a space of love.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a visualization
or manifestation of something

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
you want in your life,
if you can give it

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:90%
with as much love in your heart.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And throw that love
and that emotion

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
into that situation, that
scenario, God always says yes.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
God is love, love is God.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if we know
that, that love is God.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
That we come from that, I call
it that energy, that space,

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:90%
anything is possible.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Anything is possible.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.319 align:middle line:84%
And just having
that awareness, that

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
knowingness that we're
in that space of love,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that things will
manifest as they're

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.145 align:middle line:84%
meant to be at the highest good
for our being, it'll happen.

00:12:15.145 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think sometimes we
have to give a little push

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
realize that we are

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:84%
able to manifest
anything we want.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:90%
OK good.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.181 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.974 align:middle line:90%
Question, yes?

00:12:25.974 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
How do you get past the
undermining of your deserving

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.335 align:middle line:90%
of that intention?

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Everybody has that.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.514 align:middle line:90%
Not feeling worthy of it.

00:12:35.514 --> 00:12:37.180 align:middle line:84%
This Is beyond me, I
don't deserve this,

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.152 align:middle line:84%
This is beyond my life,
I don't deserve it.

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
This is going to happen
to somebody else,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:90%
not happen to me.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:90%
We all go through that.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
important to assess,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
have an assessment
with yourself.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's you go into
silence and the stillness

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
in silence, and you go
back in your mind to,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.580 align:middle line:90%
let's say, your childhood.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:90%
And just see or feel.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And just your mind's eye,
kind of visualize and ask,

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.765 align:middle line:84%
what is it about me
that I feel like I

00:13:01.765 --> 00:13:03.047 align:middle line:90%
don't deserve certain things?

00:13:03.047 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:90%
And you might be very surprised.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.255 align:middle line:84%
Go back to your childhood,
certain situations

00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
might have happened where
you didn't feel worthy.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Or someone might have
said something to you

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.824 align:middle line:90%
and you were shut down.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So, sometimes you have to go
all the way back in your mind

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to your childhood and start
that way, assessing yourself.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:90%
All the way to present time.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.929 align:middle line:84%
And you might see
certain areas that

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:21.530 align:middle line:84%
are closed down, why
you don't feel worthy.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.026 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's very
important to realize

00:13:25.026 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:90%
that we are human beings.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes
a juggling act

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
between the ego self, which is
the human, and the spirit self.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:37.449 align:middle line:84%
I always say the ego,
E-G-O, we are all God,

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:90%
that God-created created being.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:90%
E-G-O, the ego-- Edging God Out.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So when the ego
gets involved, God

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any openings
to kind of come in.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Make sense to you?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And people tend to
live in love or fear.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And God is pure love, but
when we limit ourselves,

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:90%
we're living in fear.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.842 align:middle line:90%
That's fear based.

00:13:57.842 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And what is fear?

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
F- E- A- R. False
ego appearing real.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:90%
So we have that.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us tend to
live what other people want

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.540 align:middle line:84%
us to live or how other
people want us to live.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I always gotta tell
people, everything is energy.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And what anyone else
thinks about you

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
is none of your business.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So what anyone thinks of you
is none of your business.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody knows you
better than you know yourself.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
No one knows you
better than yourself.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Who can love you more than
you can love yourself?

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
We spend our whole
lifetimes searching,

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
going to other people, trying
to fill a void within ourselves.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Guess what, they can't
fill that void because they

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:90%
don't know you that well.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
You know yourself more,
you know yourself better.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So why can't I have
those relationships

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:90%
I've always wanted?

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:90%
What's the matter?

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.876 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:14:41.876 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm fearful.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.594 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough to receive.

00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And also you have to
remember something.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.489 align:middle line:84%
Because we're God beings,
because we're energy,

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and we'll manifest
exactly what we're

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
thinking, because
thoughts are things.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So if we're sending it
out, I want a relationship,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:84%
but I'm really not good
enough to have one,

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
you will have
relationship, but you

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
will draw to you someone
who is inadequate.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Someone who is not in the
same frequency that you are.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.595 align:middle line:90%
You know about this, right?

00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:84%
You have been through it, and
through it, and through it.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:10.850 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Liz.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Liz.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to, Liz, tune
into you on an energetic level

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and see what's going on as
far as manifestation with you.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.482 align:middle line:84%
So Liz, there was a lot
of pressure on you--

00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When
you were born.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of pressure
on you from the outside.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And that I have to
be a certain way.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you fell
into, this is very interesting,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.461 align:middle line:84%
one of your parents is very
independent and one is not.

00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes or no?

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I gotta
tell you that I'm not sure

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
if your mom, before
your mom had you,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
there was a little trouble
about that situation.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mmhmm.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I feel there

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.435 align:middle line:84%
was a question mark
in your mom's mind.

00:15:42.435 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
there wasn't a lot of--

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
right here, it's fine.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:48.015 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Where is she?

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:48.515 align:middle line:90%
There?

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:49.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So Liz, I brought
you up on stage

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
because I was just
tuning into you as far

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.165 align:middle line:84%
as an intuitive level and
a manifestation level.

00:15:55.165 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And seeing what was
going on around you

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and I talked about your
mother and your mother's

00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:90%
in the audience.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Hi, mom.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Wendy.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Wendy.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.590 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the
situation when you had her,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
when you became pregnant,
but the situation around you

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:90%
was not secure.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:90%
In some way--

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.648 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that, right?

00:16:11.648 --> 00:16:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel that before
she came in as a soul

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.600 align:middle line:84%
that things were
not in foundation.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
There was not a
strong foundation.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She saved my life.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
saved your life.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, sweetheart.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there
was a bit of insecurity

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.319 align:middle line:84%
and I know there was--
I'm going to cry now.

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:90%
I gotta hug you.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.434 align:middle line:90%
[WHIMPERING]

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you
for saving here life

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:90%
because I think you did.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that your life
almost ended in some ways

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.550 align:middle line:90%
before her.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was into drugs.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.874 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I know that your life almost
ended before she came in.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know it was
alcohol or drugs,

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.870 align:middle line:84%
but I also know there
was abuse around you when

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:90%
you were younger.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mmhmm.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.585 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It had to be
physical abuse, as well.

00:16:53.585 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I just got to
tell you when she comes in,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to separate
this in that I want you

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.996 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge once again
as you as a soul being

00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:84%
that you can create anything
you want in your life

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
and you can have anything
you want in your life.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.914 align:middle line:84%
You are not your mom,
you are not your father

00:17:09.914 --> 00:17:12.551 align:middle line:84%
because that situation's kind
of up and down now isn't it?

00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to talk about
it, but it's not secure right?

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to know
that that's not who you are.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:84%
You're in the same
soul group, of course.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you love mom
and dad and the other siblings.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:90%
You love them.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.462 align:middle line:90%
Are there step kids too?

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
keep on-- yeah, stepkids.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We have half
brothers and sisters.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.043 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I get steps.

00:17:30.043 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Steps, steps.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.822 align:middle line:90%
And I just-- step, step, steps.

00:17:32.822 --> 00:17:35.155 align:middle line:84%
And you gotta be careful with
kidney stones, young lady.

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kidney
stones for you.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:90%
All right, thank you.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.607 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:39.607 --> 00:17:40.034 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:17:40.034 --> 00:17:40.689 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:40.689 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do now is
I would like for all of you

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to work with me and really
try to manifest something.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never done this
before, that's just fine.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.815 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather you never did
it before and work with me

00:17:51.815 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:90%
now as pure as it can be.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And it really will help you.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So those at home, you can
just listen to my voice

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.187 align:middle line:90%
as I visualize with you.

00:18:00.187 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes, if you could.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.936 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in the audience,
just close your eyes.

00:18:03.936 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep
breath and exhale.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I want you inhale a
beautiful golden light.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like for you to envision
that beautiful golden light

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
come to the very
top of your head.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And sitting in your heart and
flowing through the whole body

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and as you exhale,
exhale out of your mouth

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.815 align:middle line:90%
a color of gray mist.

00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So together let's bring in
the beautiful golden light.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.286 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And let it go, let
it go, let it go.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, bring that beautiful
golden light and inhale.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.364 align:middle line:90%
And then one more time.

00:18:58.364 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And bring yourself that
beautiful golden light

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:00.946 align:middle line:90%
inside the body.

00:19:00.946 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Inhale, holding it two,
three, four, and exhale.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And let it go, let
it go, let it go.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And now in your mind's
eye, in your imagination,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I would like for you to create a
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.460 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual room.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
A room of your own design,
of your own delight,

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
filled with everything you love.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's music, or art, or
food, whatever it is you want,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:90%
that's great.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure that this
space, that this environment

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
is exactly all about you.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Everybody at home, make this
exactly as you want this room.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
it's an extension of
you, of your higher mind.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.462 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.462 --> 00:19:58.962 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:58.962 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And as you visualize this
room, please now place yourself

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:90%
in the center of this room.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you place yourself
in the center of this room,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
begin to align yourself with
all of the items in that room.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Begin to align yourself with
all the objects in that room.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:84%
That you become
one in connection

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
with all those lovely, beautiful
things which embrace your soul

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and lighten your heart.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.575 align:middle line:84%
And just bring yourself to
that mindset, to that feeling,

00:20:35.575 --> 00:20:36.944 align:middle line:90%
to that space.

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:41.864 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.864 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And now as you see
yourself in that room,

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
standing there
centered in that room,

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I want you to open
up your hands,

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:84%
open up your hands as you
stand there in that room

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and make a gesture to receive.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Make a gesture to receive.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You send out the message to
the universe: I am receiving.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And inside of your
hands, I want you

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to see in detail, in
specifics, exactly something

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that you want
manifested right now.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
In this room.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself into complete
receptive mode with your mind,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
with your heart,
with your being.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And see this, whether
it's a condition of life,

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a scenario
in life, whether it's

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:90%
an object, whatever that is.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Align yourself fully.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
From your heart,
with the universe,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and with this scenario of
receiving and manifesting.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:90%
See it, feel it, be it.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Let it also now become
a part of your being.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Let it also now become
a part of the room

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:90%
that you're standing in.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And see it inside this room as
a living object, as a living

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.416 align:middle line:84%
And feel the love for
this manifestation.

00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Great, great.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.249 align:middle line:90%
Great job.

00:22:37.249 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's very
interesting because I'm

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:84%
very, very aware physically
of what's going on,

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also very, very aware
of energetically as you're

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:84%
getting it, as
you're feeling it,

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and I really do feel like a
wave of energy that comes over.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And even the people that are
watching this on their sets

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
or computers, it's just really
interesting that we send out

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that energy to everybody
and letting them take it.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.939 align:middle line:90%
Take a part of it.

00:23:01.939 --> 00:23:03.355 align:middle line:84%
So does anybody
want to share what

00:23:03.355 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:90%
they experienced with that?

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.154 align:middle line:90%
Yes, anybody over here?

00:23:10.154 --> 00:23:11.070 align:middle line:90%
What did you wish for?

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:90%
What did you manifest?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I was
thinking about--

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because and
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.768 align:middle line:84%
I saw colors all around you
when you were doing this.

00:23:16.768 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:90%
I saw colors of lights.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:84%
All different colors all
around you, your aura.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.412 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, that's awesome.

00:23:21.412 --> 00:23:22.203 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What?

00:23:22.203 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
What were you manifesting
or visualizing?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.662 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I was thinking
about a bar of silver.

00:23:27.662 --> 00:23:30.244 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What I was getting
with you, really interesting,

00:23:30.244 --> 00:23:32.430 align:middle line:84%
was not only the colors
melding around you,

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I saw a lot of,
like, financial stuff

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:90%
around you like money stuff.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Like wealth.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.709 align:middle line:84%
I saw a lot of
wealth coming to you.

00:23:38.709 --> 00:23:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And I saw wealth coming
to you in different ways.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.375 align:middle line:84%
It was not only wealth
that I manifest,

00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
but it was coming to you in
all different types of ways

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in different types
of projects, or work

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.450 align:middle line:84%
areas, all different types
of things from all over.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But I think you're
a very good magnet.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.637 align:middle line:90%
We're all magnets, you know?

00:23:53.637 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think you're
a very good magnet.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that as
far as financial stuff,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I kept on seeing
this manifestation.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:84%
That not going to
worry about that,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.593 align:middle line:84%
that things are going
to present themselves,

00:24:03.593 --> 00:24:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and I think you
already know that.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sweet, thanks.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sweet, sweet!

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.084 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, please.

00:24:09.084 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Lori.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Lori.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.538 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
a part of this space.

00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I need your energy.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I have been depleted and
I feel honestly nothing.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I was trying to
manifest happiness and goodness

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that I bring to others, I felt
myself being sad for myself.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.085 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:24:28.085 --> 00:24:30.335 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let me ask you
this, when you visualized

00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that room, was
there a bed there?

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.556 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:32.556 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because my
feeling was with you was,

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
and as you're saying
it now, my sense

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to
take time for yourself.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
feel you're depleted

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
is not just things
that have happened,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.785 align:middle line:90%
but you're so good at giving--

00:24:44.785 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.751 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Giving,
giving, giving,

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:84%
giving that you don't
give back to self.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's
what I think it is.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's a depletion.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a depletion.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you have bottom of
the spine, you probably have--

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my god, yes.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.121 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spinal
problems, you have to.

00:24:58.121 --> 00:25:00.635 align:middle line:84%
Because first chakra, we
just did a show about this.

00:25:00.635 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.968 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
it really is when

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
people are plugged into you for
their survival, which they are,

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:90%
then it depletes on you.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:08.738 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, you know.

00:25:08.738 --> 00:25:10.987 align:middle line:84%
We get-- you're such a good
person, you're a healer,

00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:12.695 align:middle line:84%
you're a very sensitive
person and you're

00:25:12.695 --> 00:25:14.991 align:middle line:84%
a person who thinks
to people-- I'm

00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:84%
going to give you
everything, come on, I'm

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:90%
going to give you everything.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Here's my hand-out.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: My hand-out.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.920 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.169 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you've done
your whole life, hand-out.

00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But guess what you
have to learn now?

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Self?

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hand-up.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hands-up.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It doesn't
mean you don't love them,

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that you're not
there for them, but guess what?

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.616 align:middle line:90%
Now you got to save your energy.

00:25:32.616 --> 00:25:34.615 align:middle line:84%
You really got to save
your energy for yourself.

00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because you
can't be depleted all the time.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You just can't.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do now, I'd like

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.548 align:middle line:84%
to do is a different way of
communicating with spirit

00:25:41.548 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and would like to do
is to tap into spirit

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.359 align:middle line:84%
coming in and really seeing
if they're around you.

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm able to tune
into that frequency which

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is next to you that
you want to tap into.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Just because sometimes
you want to contact

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
one particular person doesn't
always mean they're around you.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
It might be somebody else.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.781 align:middle line:84%
Now many times what happens is
I will connect with one person

00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and that personal will
bring in a relative

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.386 align:middle line:84%
or friend for the
person behind them.

00:26:06.386 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't even know them,
but they're opening up the door

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:90%
for that to happen.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
So is that OK?

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So we'll try and see if we can
connect with a spirit that way,

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.605 align:middle line:90%
yeah?

00:26:13.605 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
anybody over here?

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.546 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:17.546 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, how are you?

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great, how are you?

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name's Kristi.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi,
Kristi, how are you?

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Nice to see you.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Nice to see you too.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to connect
with my mother.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mother,
I thought your mom.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Carol.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Carol,
OK so we'll see

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
what happens if the
mother comes through.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Your mother who's
passed over, I need

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
interior of your mom.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:84%
In that, I need to tell you that
the feeling I have inside me

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel right.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:10%
So mom passed over very fast
and very suddenly, correct?

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do You know
that your mother passed away

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.680 align:middle line:90%
without knowing it?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what I'm trying
to say to you is when spirits,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
when we pass out of the body,
there's-- yeah, I hear you,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:90%
go on.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:90%
You pray to your mom.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.135 align:middle line:84%
You pray to her every single
night, do you understand that?

00:26:58.135 --> 00:27:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I talk
to her all the time.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.218 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so before
you go to sleep at night,

00:27:02.218 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
she said, she's right
by you by the bed.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.662 align:middle line:10%
And I know that you've
been wanting to-- go on.

00:27:07.662 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've
been wanting to really

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.967 align:middle line:84%
connect with her
every night and she

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:90%
said she's with you every night.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on, go on.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you also have
an old doll that

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.750 align:middle line:84%
belonged to you when
you were a little girl?

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you have an old doll?

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do, don't you?

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.913 align:middle line:84%
Because she's referring
to an old doll

00:27:22.913 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:90%
that you still have with you.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.946 align:middle line:84%
And, well, you think
about her with this doll.

00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, your mother
when she passes,

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
she passes very quickly, she's
out of the body very fast.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:90%
And she does not feel a thing.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I know that your first
desire for your mother

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.593 align:middle line:90%
was if she felt something.

00:27:36.593 --> 00:27:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
it make sense to you?

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she did not.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now she's
talking to me about a brother.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.590 align:middle line:90%
So you have a brother?

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.912 align:middle line:90%
You have a brother down here?

00:27:44.912 --> 00:27:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have two,
but one specifically

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.463 align:middle line:90%
that they were very close.

00:27:48.463 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just want
to say that would you

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.210 align:middle line:84%
please let your brother
know that she's fine.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
That she is fine, OK?

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.129 align:middle line:90%
And was there a car accident?

00:27:57.129 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Was this a car
accident of some kind?

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wasn't there
another car involved In this?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.174 align:middle line:84%
And was there a man
driving that other car?

00:28:04.174 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.825 align:middle line:90%
Is he living?

00:28:06.825 --> 00:28:07.700 align:middle line:90%
Or is he passed over.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
he's still living.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a
lesson for your mother

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:90%
was she had to forgive him.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Did this also make
the newspapers?

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:16.627 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:16.627 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All
right, because she's

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.160 align:middle line:84%
talking about being
in the newspapers.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know you still
have some articles

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.019 align:middle line:90%
or you still have that.

00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:25.894 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also want to talk
about-- I understand

00:28:25.894 --> 00:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that-- a scrapbook or some
kind of a book you have.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And were you just
recently looking

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.564 align:middle line:84%
at some kind of a scrapbook
with your mother in it?

00:28:34.564 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.766 align:middle line:90%

>>VAN PRAAGH: Two months ago.

00:28:39.348 --> 00:28:42.442 align:middle line:84%
But I know that you still have
it not finished, she said.

00:28:42.442 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
There's something about it,
I'm still not finished with it.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.093 align:middle line:90%

00:28:46.093 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And who is Mary,
Marie, this name?

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's my middle
name and her middle name.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
her middle name, OK.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And everybody else's

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.336 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK, OK, OK.

00:28:55.336 --> 00:28:55.836 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:28:55.836 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And is there a Carol somewhere?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.631 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's her, Carol.

00:28:59.631 --> 00:29:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's it.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:90%
So I get the Carol name.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And a very, very strong
going-- so it's Carol, right?

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.114 align:middle line:84%
And do you have a necklace that
belonged to Carol, your mom?

00:29:08.114 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there a necklace
that you have?

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:10.970 align:middle line:84%
You still have my
necklace, she said.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:11.636 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:11.636 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:84%

very proud of that.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%

proud that you have that, OK?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.737 align:middle line:90%
And I gotta tell you that.

00:29:16.737 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to leave
you with that, OK?

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:84%

[APPLAUSE]

00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:24.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, anybody else over here.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:25.252 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:25.252 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I was hoping to
get in contact with my brother.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:29.793 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your brother
passed over, OK, great.

00:29:29.793 --> 00:29:30.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.862 align:middle line:90%
And what is his name?

00:29:32.862 --> 00:29:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Todd.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Todd, OK, great.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Your name is Lori?

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.681 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Leslie.

00:29:37.681 --> 00:29:39.867 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leslie, your
brother that passed over.

00:29:39.867 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Lori.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're Lori?

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
guys come together?

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.226 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:44.226 --> 00:29:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.386 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's really weird.

00:29:47.386 --> 00:29:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
what we think.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, it's very,
very weird between you guys.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you, there's a
connection between the two

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:90%
of you, without a doubt.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Which one of you lost your mom?

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, because I have a mom here.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Really strong.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So your mother comes
in very, very strong.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Now you might have
come in here wanting

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to talk to your brother, but
I get your mother really,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:90%
really strongly.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And your mom likes her.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:90%
She likes Lori.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:90%
So there's a connection.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.381 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is your mom giving me
a little bit of a dance here?

00:30:10.381 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:90%
So she's--

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She loved dancing.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.435 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's dancing
and she just wants to dance.

00:30:13.435 --> 00:30:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
she's talking about.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.606 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:15.606 --> 00:30:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know because mom

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.650 align:middle line:84%
wants to let you
know she's fine.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.275 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now I want to
ask you also, was there cancer?

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.053 align:middle line:90%
And someone had cancer?

00:30:23.053 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:90%
With your mother?

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I gotta tell you, I
feel like one thing is wrong,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.740 align:middle line:90%
then something else goes wrong.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And something else goes wrong.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Something else goes wrong.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So I feel riddled
throughout my body.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.970 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was cancer.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.363 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I really do.

00:30:35.363 --> 00:30:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just get a sense of this
lady being very, very much

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.290 align:middle line:84%
full of love and the
effervescence kind

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.660 align:middle line:90%
of like threw her, you know?

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.390 align:middle line:84%
She had this
effervescence about her.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking to
me about slippers.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:84%
This is really
funny, but there's

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.810 align:middle line:90%
something about slippers.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Like bedroom slippers,
or bunny slippers,

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
something about slippers.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And she's giving me enthusiastic
or laughing about that.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.555 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a pair of
her slippers now, please?

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, so
if I go to your home

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and if I go to
your closet, which

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.505 align:middle line:84%
I won't do without
permission, but if I go there,

00:31:05.505 --> 00:31:08.130 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't I find some things that
belong to your mother, please?

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wouldn't I
find objects or items hanging

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
there in the closet there
that belonged to your mom.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So if I would go
there, I'm going to tell you,

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that your shoes are
also in that same closet.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Shoes, tennis shoes, and
these sort of things.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.902 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell you
that your mother said

00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:84%
you have a pair of
her shoes there.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
A pair of her slippers
or slip-on shoes.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.608 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:31:27.608 --> 00:31:28.108 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:28.108 --> 00:31:29.572 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, gosh.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:30.635 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't worry.

00:31:30.635 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you all
about your mom.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They're
in my drawer.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:33.615 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you must
have been looking at them.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they're a size eight,

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:84%
but someone has a size eight
shoe she's talking about.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Size eight shoe.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.225 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:31:43.225 --> 00:31:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what I get.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good, good, good.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I understand that.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.630 align:middle line:84%
She loves everything
you did for her.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know you
drove her to places.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.124 align:middle line:84%
I know you drover
her for treatments.

00:31:55.124 --> 00:31:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Or you drove her to
the medical centers.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Not just one, but centers.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you really
helped me with that.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I know at one time,
I'm in a wheelchair.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So I know she places
me in a wheelchair,

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:90%
she's sitting there.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And you had to bring
her around and I'm

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
seeing this very clearly.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I know that I want to say
to you I love you so much,

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:90%
so much gratitude here.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But I know you did things
that others could not

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.334 align:middle line:90%
do in your family.

00:32:15.334 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
did the extra mile.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, you went
the extra mile.

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes..

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
really gotta tell you

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.246 align:middle line:84%
that your mother
appreciates that.

00:32:21.246 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Is your father still
down here on the earth?

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just passed.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.575 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just passed.

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not
getting your dad.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting
your dad strongly.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:84%
She's referring to him, so
let's see what she says.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.720 align:middle line:84%
She said he's around me,
but she said he's resting

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.975 align:middle line:90%
or he's in a different space.

00:32:33.975 --> 00:32:34.670 align:middle line:90%
So I gotta tell you that.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
gotta tell you that.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I believe that.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.481 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that your mom gives me

00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:84%
a feeling or a sense that
she's working with-- go on,

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.086 align:middle line:90%
right, OK.

00:32:44.086 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
She said, I look in on
him, I'm looking in on him.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.524 align:middle line:90%
He's working on himself.

00:32:49.524 --> 00:32:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.689 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
looking in on him.

00:32:51.689 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:90%
He's working on himself.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.426 align:middle line:90%
I want to ask who had the birds?

00:32:54.426 --> 00:32:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Who had the bird
in the the cage?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.299 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:32:56.299 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:90%
The birds?

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mom.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Because she's talking about
the birds in the cage.

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.491 align:middle line:84%
You know about the
birds in the cage.

00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, they
told me over here

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that I had to give
you validation.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.050 align:middle line:90%
So the birds in the cage.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.218 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
about the refrigerator

00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:09.820 align:middle line:90%
door that's not working.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Or that the squeak or something
about the refrigerator door.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And very, very funny, now
I understand that, got it.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:84%
When your mother
had the medication,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.620 align:middle line:84%
wasn't some of the medication
kept in the refrigerator

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:22.786 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:22.786 --> 00:33:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wasn't it
kept on the door, please?

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.082 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this
lady said sometimes

00:33:29.082 --> 00:33:31.040 align:middle line:84%
that door would squeak,
or we couldn't open it,

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:31.970 align:middle line:90%
or we had to really pull it.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
that, sweetheart?

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what
she's telling me here.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
telling me that here.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you really helped

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.070 align:middle line:84%
her try to feel better
when she was at home.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I know you tried helping her.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about the
temperature going up and down

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.250 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Her temperature fluctuated
really, really hot and cold.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:52.460 align:middle line:90%
And really hot and cold.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And you had put the
blanket on her, as well.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know the blanket

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that you would use looks like
it was stitched in some way.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was
an afghan of some kind.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it?

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's what
she's showing me here.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know putting
it on the body

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and I know that I want to
be careful about diabetes

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:90%
in the family.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So I know there'd be some
diabetes in your family line.

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she's making
me acknowledge that as well.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.608 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to tell you that.

00:34:14.608 --> 00:34:15.480 align:middle line:90%
So your mom is fine.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I really gotta
give you my heart.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she had a
heart necklace or a necklace

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.539 align:middle line:90%
with a heart on it, didn't she?

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, she did.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I'm
giving that to you right now.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:24.719 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's giving
that to you right now.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.242 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to leave
you with that, OK?

00:34:27.242 --> 00:34:27.411 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.061 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: OK,
thank you very much.

00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:30.008 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:30.008 --> 00:34:31.799 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Anybody
else have a question?

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:32.596 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:33.429 align:middle line:90%
You have a question?

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:34.369 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to get to you.

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:35.179 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Karen.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Karen.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:90%
Today's theme is manifestation.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
that's been very hard for you.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:40.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I know it's been hard
for you to manifest.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's been hard
with you for self-worth.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I just
need to let you know that.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Behind you, I have
your mother, but I also

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:84%
have her mother
on the other side.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.777 align:middle line:84%
I also have another
lady come here.

00:34:52.777 --> 00:34:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I
have three women that

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.916 align:middle line:90%
come in here especially for you.

00:34:55.916 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I feel they're
all connected.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I have, like, the
sister, mother, mother.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Mother, two sisters,
this sort of thing.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And did you not speak to your
mother before she passed over?

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Were you not able
to speak to her?

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's OK to cry.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to cry.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.565 align:middle line:90%
Because your mom is here.

00:35:11.565 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And your mom said you
weren't able to speak to her.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.429 align:middle line:10%
And I know you tried speaking
to her, but she didn't hear you?

00:35:16.429 --> 00:35:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, she
was on the floor.

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She was on floor.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And you kept on talking to her
and saying something to her.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.183 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she heard you.

00:35:23.183 --> 00:35:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Your mom was out of it
before she was-- you know,

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.904 align:middle line:90%
she was gone quickly.

00:35:26.904 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I gotta tell you that.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.914 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:28.914 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:90%
So she didn't feel anything?

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
didn't feel anything.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Your mother was gone quickly.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.090 align:middle line:90%
I get her around the bed.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Did she fall near a bed?

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Or was there a bed close by?

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Because I keep on seeing a bed.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.768 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
was in her bedroom.

00:35:39.768 --> 00:35:42.850 align:middle line:84%
She yelled my name and I walked
in and she was on the floor.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So let me
just tell you something.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not your fault
your mom passed.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.096 align:middle line:84%
And you could not
have saved her.

00:35:49.096 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.678 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, You
could not have saved her.

00:35:52.678 --> 00:35:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So she doesn't want you to feel
like you could've saved her.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.582 align:middle line:84%
You keep on running
around with that.

00:35:57.582 --> 00:35:59.706 align:middle line:84%
With that feeling like you
could've done something,

00:35:59.706 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I should have done something,
if only I was there five minutes

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.470 align:middle line:84%
before, it wouldn't
have happened.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Your mother said, stop that.

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:90%
She's like, let's stop it.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.273 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I know you tried
doing the best you could.

00:36:11.273 --> 00:36:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I know you did.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.740 align:middle line:90%
You did great.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.640 align:middle line:84%
I also want to ask you,
who got the wedding,

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.062 align:middle line:90%
who had to get married quickly?

00:36:18.062 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand about that?

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My son got married.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I
don't know if there

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:90%
was a pressure to get married.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Or and didn't he get married
away from everybody on his own?

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Or what was that about?

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Little quiet thing there.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.994 align:middle line:90%
Say yes or no.

00:36:32.994 --> 00:36:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Because she's telling
me that he got

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:90%
married away from everybody.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:38.779 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I almost
want to say eloping or doing

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.844 align:middle line:90%
his own thing.

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now is
there a baby there?

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Two.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: From him?

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.965 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two babies?

00:36:47.965 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.771 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was
there one baby that

00:36:49.771 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:84%
wasn't expected
or was a surprise?

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.703 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The first one.

00:36:55.703 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Who works in roofing or home
building or construction?

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.734 align:middle line:84%
Has he had anything
to do with that

00:37:02.734 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:84%
or has he been
around that lately?

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No?

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why she keeps on--

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, he
just did his house.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, do you
know if he got a new roof?

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Or there was talk
about getting the new--

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They have
to get a new roof.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They
have to get a new roof.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's got a leak.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Telling me about the roof.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And showing me that
roof type of thing.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.760 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.052 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly where it is too.

00:37:19.052 --> 00:37:21.218 align:middle line:84%
Toward the front of the
house, toward the left side,

00:37:21.218 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:90%
it's right where the hole is.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:22.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.585 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk about
a bracelet you have

00:37:26.585 --> 00:37:27.640 align:middle line:90%
of your mother's.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.320 align:middle line:90%
A bracelet.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:28.975 align:middle line:90%
Is that hers?

00:37:28.975 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Because she's talking
to me about a bracelet.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it's hers.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK and
can I just tell you

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:90%
something from your mother?

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:35.314 align:middle line:90%
Deep from her.

00:37:35.314 --> 00:37:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you,
the grandmother is here,

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.500 align:middle line:84%
this other woman is here,
and I've got to tell you,

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and I'm gonna cry, of course.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you that in
order for this to manifest,

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.610 align:middle line:84%
there are many factors
that have to happen.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is the spirits
come in with a lot of energy.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.707 align:middle line:84%
And if you're afraid or
fearful, it kind of blocks them.

00:37:52.707 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I had
this grandmother person

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.462 align:middle line:84%
here and this other
lady and I know

00:37:56.462 --> 00:37:57.920 align:middle line:84%
she's a relative
to the grandmother

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.295 align:middle line:84%
and I know that
they've come here

00:37:59.295 --> 00:38:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to help your mother
communicate today.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.168 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:02.168 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Now why did she always used
to collect the rubber bands?

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.280 align:middle line:90%
The rubber bands.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if she had
rubber bands on her wrist

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:84%
or if she had a little
jar with the rubber bands.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:90%
But.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Where
she worked, she

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.731 align:middle line:84%
had to bundle things
in rubber bands,

00:38:13.731 --> 00:38:15.993 align:middle line:84%
she would probably
have them on her hands.

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:16.492 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:16.492 --> 00:38:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I worked with her.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
you worked with her?

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Rubber bands, rubber bands.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.001 align:middle line:90%
I see rubber bands.

00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:21.656 align:middle line:90%
So it's funny.

00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:22.780 align:middle line:90%
She's just showing me that.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.404 align:middle line:84%
She showed me the
rubber bands and that

00:38:24.404 --> 00:38:25.554 align:middle line:90%
would make sense to you.

00:38:25.554 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, definitely.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's important.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.864 align:middle line:90%
So all right, I understand that.

00:38:28.864 --> 00:38:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
You can't be
everything to everyone.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.164 align:middle line:90%
You can't be that to your boy.

00:38:34.164 --> 00:38:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And does he drive a
pickup truck or have

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.290 align:middle line:90%
some kind of a truck please?

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, they
have like a van truck.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
know it's broken,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.460 align:middle line:84%
or there's something not
right-- working right.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.175 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, they
have to get a new one.

00:38:43.175 --> 00:38:44.223 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she just said to me

00:38:44.223 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:90%
it's not working right.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just
gotta tell you that.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They're getting one.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going
to tell you one more thing

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and then I'm going to close.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:84%
That I know that
your mother, this

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.412 align:middle line:84%
might sound very strange to
you, but she's around music.

00:38:54.412 --> 00:38:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not at all.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she wants to tell you

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.100 align:middle line:90%
she's taking singing lessons.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:90%
She's taking singing.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know
if I could tell you

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that I'm singing
that I'm in heaven.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
that make sense?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I'll
leave you with that.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.382 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:39:08.382 --> 00:39:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you,
thank you so much.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:10.545 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:39:10.545 --> 00:39:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you everyone.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.306 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:14.306 --> 00:39:16.030 align:middle line:84%
The true art of
manifestation is really

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:84%
realizing that we
can have anything

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:84%
we want as long as we put
yourself into that space.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And, really, God says yes,
our humanness says no.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.724 align:middle line:90%
So stay in that God space.

00:39:25.724 --> 00:39:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you
manifest everything

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.280 align:middle line:90%
that you want in your life.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, let
the light and love

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.447 align:middle line:90%
of spirit be around you always.

00:39:31.447 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.529 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very, very much.

00:39:33.529 --> 00:39:35.185 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:39:35.185 --> 00:39:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:53.367 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
