00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi everyone.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Hi, how are you?

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Nice to meet you.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.972 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, and
welcome to SpiritTalk,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
where we take you one
step closer to Heaven.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
all for joining me today.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And everyone here
in the audience,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:90%
thank you for joining me today.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I thought today we'd talk
about a subject which everybody

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is going to experience
one day in their life.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
And that is death.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
That is that we all will
die one day, won't we?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Because death is a part of life.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And it really, really
is important that we

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.770 align:middle line:84%
have more of an understanding
of what happens to our spirit

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.612 align:middle line:90%
upon physical death.

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:10%
So I thought today's
topic would be

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:10%
very good to talk about
what happens after we die.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:10%
Everybody who comes
to see me, they always

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.181 align:middle line:10%
ask the same question.

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And they of course
want to know, everybody

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
has a natural curiosity about,
what happens to the spirit

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:90%
upon physical death?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of us share two
common experiences in life.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.064 align:middle line:90%
The first is birth.

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
And we've been through that.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So we know a little
bit about that.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.406 align:middle line:84%
We've heard about it,
we've read about it.

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
There's been research
done about birth.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.541 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
a lot about death.

00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:10%
Except for many people
have had near death

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:10%
experiences and have
come back and told us

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.649 align:middle line:10%
a little about
their experiences.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And also from the
spirit world, where

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.380 align:middle line:84%
those loved ones have come
back and really talked

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
about the experience of
when they left the body,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and where they went to,
and what it was like.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
What that transitionary
period was like.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to
share with you today

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
exactly what I gave gleaned, the
information that I have gleaned

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
over the many, many years of
speaking with the spirit world.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And many, many years of
communicating with them.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And also working with people
in the audience as well.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's important to know
that when I do my work,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.785 align:middle line:84%
that I stand up
here and I really

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.490 align:middle line:84%
am a vessel for
the spirit world.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I stand before you
and I really am

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:90%
in a space where I just receive.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
And I receive from
the spirit world

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.940 align:middle line:84%
whoever wants to come
and use me to bring

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
through a message for
everybody that's watching,

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:90%
everybody here in the audience.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.709 align:middle line:84%
And I really have
no agenda about it.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
The agenda I might
have is, you know,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
I want this to be
the best we can do.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Before I come out
here on the stage,

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I will say to the
spirit world, "I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
am here to do the highest
good for the spirit world.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I am here to do your
work and may the work

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that's being done today
be a blessing to everybody

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:90%
that's watching this."

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So I would like
to share with you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of my
experience about really

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
what it's like to
pass out of the body.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Death itself, when the spirit
leaves the physical body,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:90%
there is no pain.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.986 align:middle line:84%
There is no pain at
all in physical death.

00:02:45.986 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So many people
think, oh, someone

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
died in a car accident,
or a plane crash,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
or they had a heart attack,
or there was a fire.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:90%
There is no pain at all.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
God in its wondrous
way gives us what

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:90%
we call like a shut-off valve.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.764 align:middle line:90%
Like you lose consciousness.

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Right before the
spirit leaves the body,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
or as it's leaving
that body, there

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
is a loss of consciousness.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.005 align:middle line:84%
So you do not feel it
on the physical level.

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Now isn't that
good to know that?

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.725 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to
relax with that awareness.

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
There have been
many, many people

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
who have talked about near
death experiences, exactly

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.625 align:middle line:90%
what happens.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
They're very aware they're
inside the body and next thing

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
they know they're
outside of the body.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Death is very much that way.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.514 align:middle line:84%
Now, leading up to when
the spirit leaves the body,

00:03:26.514 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
of course it can be painful.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
If there's a disease involved
like a cancer, or AIDS,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
or something that really
hurts the body or physically

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:84%
you feel pain in
the body, that's

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.090 align:middle line:84%
something of course
which is very real.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But God in its
wondrous way has also

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
created wonderful medicines,
inventions, droplets of God

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
has inspired the scientists
to come up with medications.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.994 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to feel pain.

00:03:50.994 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to feel pain.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason why
you have to feel pain.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.075 align:middle line:90%
So remember that.

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is often talked about
when they come back, you know,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to feel
pain in the body.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.664 align:middle line:84%
And I was relieved
that there was

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:03.825 align:middle line:84%
no pain at all when
I left that body.

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who passes out of
the body, when it's your turn

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
to go home-- and the
spirit world is our home.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
This human earth right
here is not our home.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:90%
This is our schoolroom.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.157 align:middle line:84%
We come back here for our
soul to learn many lessons.

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And whatever lessons that
you have on your agenda,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
on your slate, is
specific to your soul.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So some lessons might involve
compassion, or forgiveness,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:84%
or love of self, trying
to love each other.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever specific
lessons you have

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
on your agenda
for your soul, you

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
chose before you came
back into the lifetime.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.465 align:middle line:84%
So I often will tell people
that when their soul is finished

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
with all its classes
and all of its lessons,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.490 align:middle line:90%
it's time to graduate.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
really do believe.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
That passing out of the
physical body, the transition

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
that we call death,
is really a state

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness from the
physical consciousness

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:90%
into the spirit and being free.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Being free.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
I myself have had a near death
experience many years back.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I know why I
had the near death experience,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:84%
because now I can teach about
what my experiences were

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:90%
from firsthand.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
that my experience,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.932 align:middle line:84%
I actually left the body, and
I was looking down at the body.

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
very first thing

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that I felt was a sense
of complete peace.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Complete and utter peace.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't even describe
it in human terms.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
The words don't come close
to the feeling that I had.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I also had a sense that there
was a sense of connectedness.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
That I was connected to
every single other person.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And that we're all connected
as souls, we're all connected.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit people
have often said

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:84%
the same thing
they've come through.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:90%
That my death was painless.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Every single person is met
at the time of their passing

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
by someone in their family
who has pass over before them.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
No one ever dies alone.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.200 align:middle line:90%
No one ever dies alone.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I want you to know that.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.854 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever alone.

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Spirit's always around
you all the time,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
helping us,
assisting us in life.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when time comes for you
to actually leave the body,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:90%
it's joyful.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very happy.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit people prepare
for your passing months, if not

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.334 align:middle line:90%
years, before.

00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
They will prepare
for your passing

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and they'll be there
at the side of the bed.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:84%
They'll be around
you at your house.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:90%
They know when it's your time.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And just think of the
reunion that happens.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Just think how
happy they finally

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
are to get you fully in
spirit right with them.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.140 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really wonderful.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
So just imagine the joy.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine the joy?

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.550 align:middle line:90%
The joy.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.185 align:middle line:84%
The wonderful joy
that they have.

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you leave the body
and you're with all your loved

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
ones, you feel their
love right away.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense of
reunion, this connection.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, we're back again.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:90%
We're together again.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can just imagine that
that feels, how wonderful.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.246 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that many,
many souls will then

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
be drawn up with
their loved ones

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:90%
to a golden light or a tunnel.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And they have often
described that they're

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a
floating atmosphere.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.067 align:middle line:84%
And they look around, and they
see all of these golden lights.

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
those golden lights

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that they see all
around them are

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:90%
other souls that have passed.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're going home
their own soul groups.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that lovely?

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Just that visualization.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's so important.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the set we
have here of all the stars.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
But they have often
described it to me--

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and they've actually
shown me once--

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:90%
where I was actually floating.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And I felt, and looked
around, and there

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
were these golden
lights going toward

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.822 align:middle line:90%
this bright, bright light.

00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what is that?

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And I could see they were
forms, they were bodies.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And they were souls.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they've
often described it.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had that
vision once of that.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a reunion, it's
joyful, it's happy.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Everybody going home
with their soul groups.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It seems that once you get
there to the other side of life

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension, of course
you're met by your family

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.508 align:middle line:90%
They're with you.

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:90%
They escort you over there.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:90%
They show you this new life.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And you go to what's
called the astral world.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The astral world is a
replica of the physical world

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
with gardens, and flowers, and
trees, and lakes, and houses,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and buildings.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a very real
and solid world.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But remember, it is
another dimension.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
It is very physical
dimension on that level.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:84%
But when you come back
down to the physical earth

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to go to your memorial
service, or your funeral,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
or to let your loved ones
know that you are still alive,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:90%
which we all do.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.989 align:middle line:90%
We all come back and we visit.

00:08:20.989 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you all remember
the movie, Ghost?

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember the movie
Ghost, Patrick Swayze?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Remember that movie?

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very real.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.619 align:middle line:84%
When spirits will come back to
their loved ones on the earth

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:90%
to let them know, I'm fine.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dead.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as
death, no such thing whatsoever.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.789 align:middle line:84%
And they really want
to impart upon you

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to have that realization.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine, I'm alive.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Don't think of me as dead.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And I often say, if you think
of your loved one as dead,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:90%
it's very disrespectful.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Because they're very much alive.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They hear our
thoughts all the time.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.834 align:middle line:84%
So they will go back to
their memorial services,

00:08:53.834 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:84%
they'll go back
to their funerals,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
or they just go back to let
their families know, I'm OK.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:10%
Now this is very funny,
oftentimes when males pass over

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:10%
and they come back, and they'll
say, I've been to my funeral

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:10%
or I've been to my wake.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:10%
And it seems that men are very
interested in how many people

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.709 align:middle line:10%
are attending their funerals.

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:13.291 align:middle line:84%
They'll look around
and they'll count,

00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:90%
oh how many people are here?

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, and
who's paying for this?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was at
my dad's funeral,

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking
to some people.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:90%
And there was a wake for him.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So that shell was
there in the casket.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And I heard my father
come-- very, very clearly--

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
come right up to
my back of my head.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Right here he came to me.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "James, thanks
for putting my teeth in.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:90%
I look pretty good."

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes before this, we
were there at that casket

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
looking at his body.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.956 align:middle line:84%
And we're thinking,
"Oh, I'm glad we

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:44.039 align:middle line:84%
put his teeth in because
he looks so much better."

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:90%
So they hear us all the time.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
They hear our
thoughts all the time.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're always at their
funerals and memorial services.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
The women seem to be
very, very concerned

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:90%
about their appearances.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's say
they're in a coffin.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been to
thousands of funerals,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:90%
been to thousands of wakes.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have heard women look
down at the bodies and saying,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
"why'd they put
me in that dress?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I hated that dress
in the lifetime.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Why did put me in the box
with the dress on me?"

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.655 align:middle line:90%
Always, always happens.

00:10:10.655 --> 00:10:11.532 align:middle line:90%
It's so funny.

00:10:11.532 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:90%
Why'd they choose that dress?

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.031 align:middle line:90%
They were concerned about that.

00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned about
getting the makeup right.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It's such an odd thing.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But I've been invited to
many funerals and wakes

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:90%
and I've heard these things.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And the women seem to
also go around then

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and look at the flowers and
see who sent the flowers.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be very concerned
about that sort of thing.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.905 align:middle line:84%
So it's so interesting because
they're so much more alive when

00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:36.714 align:middle line:84%
they're in the spirit form than
they were in the physical form.

00:10:36.714 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that you
have that awareness, that

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.546 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness that you are first
and foremost a spiritual being

00:10:42.546 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
having a physical experience,
not the other way around.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So when it's your
time to go, you'll

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.775 align:middle line:90%
be met by everyone you know.

00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
You'll be escorted
to the spirit world.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And you'll go there and say,
this is home, this is home.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:90%
That earth, that was not home.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have no
sense of it, as far

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:90%
as connected with the earth.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.270 align:middle line:90%
It'll feel like a foreign place.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to
the other side of life,

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
you're able to, if you will,
fulfill all of your destinies

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Any abilities in
yourself that maybe

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
weren't realized when
you were on the earth.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.974 align:middle line:84%
For instance, perhaps you
wanted to play the piano when

00:11:19.974 --> 00:11:21.515 align:middle line:84%
you were living on
the earth, but you

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.187 align:middle line:84%
didn't have time
to take classes.

00:11:23.187 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
In the spirit world,
you're able to do that.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Take class in piano,
or art, sculpture,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
or learn things, go
to school, studies.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Over there you're
able to do that,

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
such thing as time

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual dimension.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Time is only relative to
the three dimensional world.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So you have all the
time in the world.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And in the other worlds.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.857 align:middle line:84%
So you really do live
out your heart desires.

00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
experience from your heart,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and express, and live
it, that's Heaven.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.880 align:middle line:90%
That's why they call it Heaven.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Your heart is met there
with your heart desires.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.594 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:11:54.594 --> 00:11:55.397 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:90%
And so is that good?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Did you enjoy that?

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.995 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody has any questions
about what I was talking about,

00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
about life after
death, about what

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.515 align:middle line:84%
happens at the time of death
when the spirit leaves,

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.306 align:middle line:84%
does anybody have any
questions about that?

00:12:05.306 --> 00:12:07.142 align:middle line:90%
And I can answer them for you.

00:12:07.142 --> 00:12:08.183 align:middle line:90%
You want to stand up, OK?

00:12:08.183 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a
microphone for you.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, yes.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
If somebody's going to
pass over, do they--

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If they're
going to, well, they will,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:16.570 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well they will, yes.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: None of us get
out of it alive, I'll tell you.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.675 align:middle line:84%
We, none of us, get
out of it alive.

00:12:19.675 --> 00:12:21.216 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: If it's
their time to go,

00:12:21.216 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
can they leave a
couple of days early?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.736 align:middle line:84%
Or do they immediately
when it happens?

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:26.652 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.652 --> 00:12:28.355 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
I've heard some

00:12:28.355 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:90%
can leave three days early.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.146 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect,
perfect, perfect.

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
the time of your birth

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and the time of
death is destined.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
What might appear to
us as some people say,

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:84%
well you know, they
were born premature.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Or they were born
by cesarean section.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.957 align:middle line:84%
Or they died before
they should have.

00:12:44.957 --> 00:12:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Or they left the
body, they came back,

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and they came into the body,
then finally left again.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I do believe it's
in divine time.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's in a
higher level of awareness,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and understanding, and control.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
really-- I think

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
it might look physically
that that's happening.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.366 align:middle line:84%
That they were late
for their death.

00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
ever that way.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.699 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a perfect
timing, when you're born

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:06.531 align:middle line:84%
and when you pass to
the other side of life.

00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
more involved,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
or the spirit world is more
involved in our everyday lives

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:90%
than we even know about.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe that.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I do believe, in many respects,
that we're merely the puppets

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:90%
and they're the puppet masters.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And the more we're
attuned to that

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.947 align:middle line:84%
and aligned with that awareness,
the easier life will be.

00:13:25.947 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.271 align:middle line:90%
Very good question.

00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Very good question.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, somebody else?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.504 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you have a
question over here.

00:13:32.504 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
stand up and I'll.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is David.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:90%
David, so you have a question.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.397 align:middle line:84%
And before you start that
question, I like your aura.

00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
As I look at you and I see
the aura that you have.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
An aura is the electromagnetic
field on every living thing.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you stood up I saw this
wonderful, wonderful yellow

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
energy, which is very much about
intellect, thinking, analyzing,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.337 align:middle line:90%
critiquing.

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're very much that
way, if I can say that to you.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
You're very much of some of
the scientific kind of mind,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:84%
who likes to put things,
figure things out all the time.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.339 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:04.339 --> 00:14:06.005 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
just going to tell you

00:14:06.005 --> 00:14:07.224 align:middle line:90%
what I see as you stand up.

00:14:07.224 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So I see more than just a
physical body standing up.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I see colors, I see energy.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that in the
past six to seven years,

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
your life has
changed drastically.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.450 align:middle line:84%
You're very, very different
than you were 20 years ago,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.946 align:middle line:90%
even 15 years ago.

00:14:21.946 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The way you think
about things, the way

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
you react to things, people
in your life have changed.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I think you're a very different
person than you used to be.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Will you accept that?

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think so, yes.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And the question you have?

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.005 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I know on
planet Earth we all-- everybody

00:14:36.005 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
speaks different languages,
different methods

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.588 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:14:38.588 --> 00:14:41.760 align:middle line:84%
But in the spirit world, is it
just one mode of communication?

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Do they all-- how do the spirits
communicate with each other?

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
a great question.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So remember that they are
spirit, first and foremost,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So they don't need to
speak, physically speak,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
because, like you said,
the different languages.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.949 align:middle line:84%
And also how do I
communicate with spirits

00:14:58.949 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
that spoke a different
language on the earth?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all done with thought.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all done telepathically.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So if they have a thought,
they'll send it to somebody.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And someone in the spirit
world, they'll meet with them.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's very,
very interesting.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:90%
This is very, very weird.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.802 align:middle line:90%
I'm such a weirdo.

00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you stood
up, I just talked

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
about your energy and the
colors I saw around you.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.027 align:middle line:84%
Now in the spirit world,
when you're over there

00:15:21.027 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking
in the spirit world

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
or in that space, when
you see another spirit,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:90%
you'll see their colors.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll first will see their
character by the colors

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:90%
that they have around them.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They will be dressed in
an outfit, a garb, that

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.054 align:middle line:84%
will reflect their
character as well.

00:15:37.054 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And the colors
around them, you'll

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
see the spiritual
level that they're at.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
You'll see who they
are as a person.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll see how much love
they have for themselves,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
for other people, how much
compassion by the colors

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:90%
that they exude.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first step
in how they communicate.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.334 align:middle line:84%
And then they also
will telepathically

00:15:51.334 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:90%
send thoughts to each other.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So they live in a
world of thought.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:90%
So it's all done telepathically.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the spirits come
back and communicate with me,

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:90%
it's done through thought.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've done work
all over the world.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
In Brazil, and I've done
it in Europe, and places

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.910 align:middle line:90%
that don't speak English.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.249 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter because
I hear it as thoughts.

00:16:11.249 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's how they communicate.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So same thing when you
pass to the spirit.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Inspiration means in spirit.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.422 align:middle line:90%
So that's thought.

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very interesting.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.796 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, very good.

00:16:20.796 --> 00:16:22.135 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, David.

00:16:22.135 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We can applaud David's
question, everyone.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.769 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes, my love.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.190 align:middle line:90%
You have a question.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And I love your energy, too.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
You tend to be
somebody who tends

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.614 align:middle line:90%
to give more than receive.

00:16:32.614 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I've
got to tell you that.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.295 align:middle line:84%
And your dad has
passed over, please?

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um, my husband.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Becuase there's
a man sitting behind you.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Is it your husband?

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, can I
come give you a reading

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:90%
before you ask a question?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Please.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would that be OK?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.248 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:16:44.248 --> 00:16:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I really
have to, in that--

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I have to.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
When I'm standing in this
space-- my spaceship, as I like

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:84%
to call it-- as I'm standing
here, it's my receptivity.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:90%
It's how I receive the spirit.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And many times, they will come
through in many different ways.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.882 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not in control of it.

00:16:59.882 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
You're really not
in control of it.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.548 align:middle line:84%
All you can do is really be
open to whatever happens.

00:17:03.548 --> 00:17:06.097 align:middle line:84%
So when I came to you before,
I saw this man behind.

00:17:06.097 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure if it was
a father figure or a husband

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:08.977 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:17:08.977 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But let me just-- and you
stood up for a question.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.599 align:middle line:84%
But maybe this is your answer
you've been looking for.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:90%
So this man comes in here.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:16.589 align:middle line:90%
And he's with a woman.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So as he comes forward
to me, he steps forward.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
He's a very gentle man,
if I can say that to you.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.673 align:middle line:90%
He's a gentle man.

00:17:22.673 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.005 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
how I describe him.

00:17:25.005 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:90%
He's a very sweet man.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know that
his sweetness was not lost.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
His sweetness is
still very much alive.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:90%
He comes to you with roses.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm giving
you red roses, OK?

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's taking a bunch
of roses, he's taking one

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and he's handing it to you.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.925 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I kept one rose from
each of the bouquets from his.

00:17:44.925 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
did you flatten them,

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
or dry them, or something?

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
he's talking to me

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
about loving that expression,
being there with you.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:90%
I know also that-- go on.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
He's a very sensitive soul
when he walks over here.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:90%
And he said, we did it together.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:90%
You and him did it together.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:90%
And you did it together.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.724 align:middle line:84%
He was ill for a little
bit there, wasn't he?

00:18:07.724 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was ill.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I know this man gives
me a feeling of being ill.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know as I let him
come closer to my vibration,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:84%
very close to me, I
ask him questions.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
him to become me.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And I just want him
to blend closer to me.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And as he blends closer to
me, I feel him come across me

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and I'm getting very
thin at one point.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling
very much, my head

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.626 align:middle line:90%
is hurting me, too, by the way.

00:18:31.626 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Didn't his diet,
was it affected?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Or could he not eat
at one point, please?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did
someone think about IVs,

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
or alternative therapy,
or some kind of IV thing.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His
daughter was a PA

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:90%
and wanted him to take medicine.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.840 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't go to the doctors.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.317 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right, right.

00:18:49.317 --> 00:18:50.650 align:middle line:90%
He will never go to the doctors.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't believe
in medical doctors.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't believe in it.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.270 align:middle line:84%
He must have been very
ill toward the end,

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.339 align:middle line:90%
because I'm there.

00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was sick
for the last month.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.588 align:middle line:84%
But he wouldn't
stop going to work.

00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
He wouldn't stop
doing anything else.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was, I'm fine.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't you dare call my daughter.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.599 align:middle line:84%
Don't you dare
tell her I'm sick.

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you tell
his daughter, your daughter,

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.240 align:middle line:90%
that you were coming here today?

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.294 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have my daughter,
his stepdaughter here.

00:19:13.294 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you knew
him very well, of course.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.205 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hold
on one second.

00:19:17.205 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, go on, go on.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:90%
He's a very stubborn man.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:90%
He's a sensitive man.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.575 align:middle line:84%
But he is stubborn, as
you know, because he

00:19:22.575 --> 00:19:23.991 align:middle line:84%
didn't want any
help from anybody.

00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think in
his whole life, he

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
didn't want any
help from anybody.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.315 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:19:28.315 --> 00:19:30.523 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I've got
to ask you about the maps.

00:19:30.523 --> 00:19:31.524 align:middle line:90%
The maps or maps.

00:19:31.524 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.773 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I would
tell you, if you

00:19:33.773 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:84%
go to a place with him where
all his books are or something,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.032 align:middle line:90%
there's an atlas there.

00:19:38.032 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:90%
There's an atlas there.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are you
aware of the atlas, please?

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
that atlas, I know

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.625 align:middle line:84%
that you will find within
the atlas, there will be,

00:19:45.625 --> 00:19:47.345 align:middle line:90%
like, stickies, sticky notes.

00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There was
a coffee table, almost.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had all of his maps
sitting underneath it.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And it has
sticky notes on it.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, sticky notes.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I didn't
even know that.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.092 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you
didn't even know that.

00:19:58.092 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:90%
So you didn't even know that.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so you understand that.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And can I give you
the microphone?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK, sweetheart?

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because your
mom's a little nervous.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
have you hold it.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.764 align:middle line:84%
People at work didn't know
I was sick until later on.

00:20:09.764 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And at one point they
put some money together.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:84%
At one point someone
put some money together.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.586 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
gave you some money

00:20:17.586 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
at the end of his life, at a
memorial service or something

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this
is money from us

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle line:90%
or something about that.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.884 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense please?

00:20:24.884 --> 00:20:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.174 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because I know
that that's been given to you.

00:20:28.174 --> 00:20:29.915 align:middle line:84%
Now, he would also
like mathematics

00:20:29.915 --> 00:20:31.250 align:middle line:90%
when he was younger.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
You know about
the math problems?

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
He liked to solve math
problems and number problems.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.624 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand, that
makes sense to you?

00:20:37.624 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:90%
And up until the what?

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:40.570 align:middle line:90%
The day I died.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.902 align:middle line:84%
He said, up until the day I died
I liked to figure things out.

00:20:43.902 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
He liked formulas-- you
understand that, right?

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.216 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He liked
to figure out formulas.

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:90%
He's very scientifically minded.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Like an engineer type.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What was he,
like an engineer please,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing?

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, OK.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what he gives
me, this feeling of engineer.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Now isn't it interesting
that I went to this gentleman

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.514 align:middle line:84%
before and talked
about scientific.

00:21:01.514 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And you might have
opened the door

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:90%
for her husband to come through.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:90%
That's very, very much.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
you and her husband,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
there's a connection
as far as the way

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:84%
you think, the way
you look at the world.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Can I just tell you
that I want to thank you

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.431 align:middle line:90%
for sitting in the backyard?

00:21:16.431 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if there's a back
deck or something back there.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Or you were sitting in the back.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.538 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:90%
There's a table outside, table.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And you were sitting
there thinking of him.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:84%
You were sitting
there thinking of him.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.823 align:middle line:84%
And he wants me to
thank you for that.

00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:28.134 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:21:28.134 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
great, great, great.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
tell you also that I

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:90%
feel-- yes, I understand that.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
I hear you, yes.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.455 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:35.455 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:84%
His temperature goes up
and down, by the way.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.663 align:middle line:90%
His fluctuates, his temperature.

00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And I also like rocks.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
there's a rock collection.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Is there a rock collection?

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because he talks
about having a rock collection.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:90%
He loved his rock collection.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, I'm trying
to heal the relationship

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
with my brother from
this side of life.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.496 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
he did not speak to him.

00:21:55.496 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
There was a problem or something
that they didn't see eye

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.210 align:middle line:90%
to eye toward the end of life.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.715 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you also-- does
that make sense to you please?

00:22:02.715 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
you understand that.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.469 align:middle line:90%
So you have his love.

00:22:05.469 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
very much for being here.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And feel his love.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're very welcome.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What I'd
like to do with you now

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
is to really work with you
as far as bringing spirit

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:90%
closer to you.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that would
be very nice, yes?

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So spirit is really
just a thought away.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Just a thought away.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So together we'll work
our energies together

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and have an experience.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:90%
We can welcome them in.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do a little
meditation and just relax.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you've never meditated
before, that's fine.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.956 align:middle line:84%
There's no right
way or wrong way.

00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just really a
relaxation exercise.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's really just to
center your being, center

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.258 align:middle line:90%
your awareness.

00:22:48.258 --> 00:22:49.466 align:middle line:90%
So let's just close our eyes.

00:22:49.466 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And just listen to
the sound of my voice.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful of
your body, of your feet

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
on the floor, your
backs on the chairs.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
Your shoulders and your arms.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Your chest, your stomach,
your legs, the neck, the head.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful of
the physical body.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And as you become mindful
of the physical body,

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
you also want to do so
with a sense of gratitude,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.270 align:middle line:90%
a sense of thankfulness.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:34.686 align:middle line:84%
Thanking your body for bringing
you from one place to another.

00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:39.410 align:middle line:84%
For all the good it does
for you, for your spirit.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:90%
To mobilize you.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:90%
To bring you forth.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So with a sense of
gratitude, thank your body.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We as spirit are more than
just the physical body.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Our spiritual energy goes
way beyond the limits

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:90%
of the physical body.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to be
aware that your energy goes

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to Mother Earth
and connects to that Mother

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Earth energy, that
beautiful Gaia energy.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
That beautiful
grounding and balancing.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth helps
to sustain life

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.870 align:middle line:84%
by keeping us centered
and grounded in our being.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.092 align:middle line:90%
We want to thank her.

00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Our energy connects
to that Mother Earth.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.594 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.594 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:84%
You as a spiritual
being are much,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
much more also than
just the awareness

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
that you have in the
body and the earth.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But you're also part
of the cosmic energy,

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.415 align:middle line:84%
the light energy,
the spiritual energy,

00:24:48.415 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual dimensions
which are way, way above us

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and all around us.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
At this moment in
your mind, I would

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
like for you to envision a
bright golden star high, high

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:90%
above you.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Way beyond this sky, way beyond
this atmosphere that we know.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:15.790 align:middle line:84%
For this gold star, this gold
light, is way, way beyond.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:84%
But with your mind
you connect with

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful golden
star, that starlight.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And as you connect more and
more with that starlight,

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:84%
begin to feel the love from
the spiritual dimensions,

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.360 align:middle line:90%
the spirit world.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
As you bask in that golden
light, just feel in your mind,

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:46.440 align:middle line:84%
in your spirit, the
oneness, the connectedness.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:90%
We are all one energy.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And as we inhale,
we're going to bring

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.400 align:middle line:84%
more of this beautiful
golden light, the starlight,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
into the awareness of our
minds, into the awareness

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:90%
of our being.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale
out of your mouth,

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
you're going to let go of
the old ways of thinking,

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.815 align:middle line:84%
the old habits, the
limitations of loving yourself.

00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You can let that stuff
go and replace it

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
with that pure,
loving golden light.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.029 align:middle line:84%
So together let's inhale that
beautiful, spiritual, celestial

00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:90%
golden light.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three, four,
and exhale out of your mouth.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a gray mist which
represents all the old ways

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that no
longer sustain you.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And together again, bringing
that beautiful golden light

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and inhale.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And hold it, two,
three, four, and exhale.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And one more time,
beautiful starlight.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And holding it two, three,
four, and then exhale,

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and let it go, let
it go, let it go.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And with your imagination, feel
that you are one in that light.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.640 align:middle line:84%
That light is shining
within you, all around you.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:90%
You are light.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And all around you is this
beautiful golden light,

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.590 align:middle line:90%
this golden circle of light.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you become aware
of this golden light,

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.800 align:middle line:84%
there seem to be some
figures of the spirit,

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.745 align:middle line:84%
loved ones that you know
in the spirit world who

00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
have passed over the
threshold of so-called death.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Open up your mind and invite
them closer to you now.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Let them step so
close to you, you

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
can feel them
connecting with you,

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:90%
connecting with your energy.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Feel their force.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Feels their love,
for love never dies.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Love never dies.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.502 align:middle line:90%
Love never dies.

00:28:09.502 --> 00:28:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And feel their personalities
come so, so close to you.

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:90%
They're not strangers to you.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:84%
You've shared your
hearts with them.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So as you invite them in,
and you feel their energy

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:84%
behind you and in
front of you, listen.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Listen with your mind.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And begin to hear a message
that they have for you.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
we ask your blessing

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:90%
upon this meeting today.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to me.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends,
speak clear to me.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Give us glimpses of eternity.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And let us know
that you are free.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Give us names, and
facts, and places.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Help us to understand
Heaven's graces.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Send your thoughts upon me
with emotion and simplicity

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:13.326 align:middle line:84%
as we sit together in
peace, love, and harmony.

00:29:13.326 --> 00:29:15.641 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:29:15.641 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And thank your friends, your
spirit friends, your loved

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Thank them for sharing
the space always.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:90%
No one is ever alone.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.718 align:middle line:90%
They're standing right with you.

00:29:28.718 --> 00:29:33.002 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath, and exhale.

00:29:33.002 --> 00:29:35.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.205 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.205 --> 00:29:44.910 align:middle line:90%
Did you enjoy that?

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
There's that connectedness
that we always have.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just that in our minds
sometimes we feel disconnected.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:84%
But we really are
always connected.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We've just got to plug in that
memory that they're very real,

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:90%
they're very much a part.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So what experiences
did you have?

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyone want to share
a couple experiences?

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Hi lovely lady, how are you?

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:07.505 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you
had an experience

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:90%
during the meditation, yes?

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:90%
What did you experience?

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lots of white light.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.306 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lots
of white light.

00:30:12.306 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, and did a spirit
person step up behind you?

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Or did people step up--

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I saw my dad.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
dad stepped up.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.305 align:middle line:90%
And my aunt.

00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And what was
the message he had for you?

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.501 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just nothing.

00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It just felt like love.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
just felt like love.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very good.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very warm.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very warm.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So you know he's
always with you.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And there with you,
and supporting you.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good, very good.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.143 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:30:28.143 --> 00:30:29.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else over here
experience something?

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I know you did.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I know you did, yes.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did, thank you.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Just a reconnectivity
with source, with love.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With
love, pure love.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:90%
You're very much a healer.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.653 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:30:42.653 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So I know you're going
to be going to classes

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:90%
and doing some things.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Or you've been recently
thinking about going

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.788 align:middle line:84%
to classes and
school of some kind.

00:30:48.788 --> 00:30:49.995 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense to you?

00:30:49.995 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.316 align:middle line:84%
And I just know you're
going to do that.

00:30:52.316 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:90%
So just stay trusting with that.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you have a
grandmother in the spirit

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:90%
world as well, don't you.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that you

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:90%
would have a photograph of her.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I know that you have her love.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you must
see her in your dreams

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.806 align:middle line:90%
every once in a while.

00:31:03.806 --> 00:31:05.155 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that she comes
in very, very close to you.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And she touches your
heart, she says.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I touch his heart.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.765 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
you to know that.

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.677 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:31:13.677 --> 00:31:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.427 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:15.427 --> 00:31:17.801 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What I'd like
to do is I'd like to connect.

00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a young man
here who comes in.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And this man I would tell
you is, I would say this man

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
passes over and is-- gosh, he
feels like in his 40s or 50s.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.280 align:middle line:84%
He's very, very young
when he passes over.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:27.989 align:middle line:90%
I have dark hair.

00:31:27.989 --> 00:31:30.446 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you that
I feel like I'm on this side,

00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:31.200 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not sure.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And if it makes sense to you
the information that I get,

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.174 align:middle line:84%
would you please acknowledge the
spirit when they come through,

00:31:36.174 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's a
brother feeling here.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like I might have a
brother who's passed over here.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.787 align:middle line:90%
And I've got to accept this.

00:31:43.787 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on, go on.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm much younger
when I passed over than older.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.149 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I'm
young when I pass over.

00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not sure if they're
mid-young, like 30s to 40s,

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.130 align:middle line:84%
but I've got to tell you that
I feel this way when I'm here.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And I feel a
brotherly connection.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got to ask if someone
is here who has a brother.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.130 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:90%
You do, and you do, yes?

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Brothers?

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.530 align:middle line:84%
A brother that passed into the
world of the spirit, correct?

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:90%
You do, yes, great.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.909 align:middle line:90%
Hi Heather.

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I know I connected
with your brother.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.824 align:middle line:84%
I was standing up here and I
connected with your brother.

00:32:09.824 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And he came in
very, very strongly.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:90%
He's still very much here.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And he comes with
a group of people.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a couple
of dogs over there as well.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing
basketball around me.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to just tell
you that first of all.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.366 align:middle line:84%
So what I would like
you to do, Heather,

00:32:22.366 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:90%
is I created these cards.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.309 align:middle line:84%
These are Talking
to Heaven cards.

00:32:25.309 --> 00:32:26.600 align:middle line:90%
And these are mediumship cards.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to try
and use these and make

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.720 align:middle line:84%
a connection, first
of all, that way.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll continue with him.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.777 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to
take those cards totally

00:32:34.777 --> 00:32:35.360 align:middle line:90%
in your hands.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.901 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to shuffle them,
put your energy in the cards.

00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.151 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
really what I want

00:32:40.151 --> 00:32:42.150 align:middle line:84%
you to do is just put
your energy in the cards.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.816 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a good shuffler,
I'm really bad.

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
But just imbue the whole
deck with your energy.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
your dad here, too.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.766 align:middle line:84%
Your dad's also
passed over, has he?

00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.033 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, he's
talking about your dad as well.

00:32:59.033 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:90%
He's with your father.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And is there someone
named Richard also?

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
who's that please?

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My stepfather.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK
And he's passed over

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.410 align:middle line:90%
into the world of the spirit?

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Or is he still here?

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's here.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.026 align:middle line:84%
Because they're talking
about Rich or Richard.

00:33:10.026 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lady over
there who knows him.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.770 align:middle line:90%
So it must be his mom, not sure.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: His mom, yeah.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:90%
But she's coming in as well.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.164 align:middle line:84%
So I have a whole
bunch of people here.

00:33:17.164 --> 00:33:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm really
being air traffic control when

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:90%
I get these people.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So as you hold those cards,
and you have your energy

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:90%
in that deck?

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you
to do is I want

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:90%
you to think of your brother.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to spread
out the cards on the table.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:90%
The whole deck?

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Any way you
feel you want to do that.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.982 align:middle line:84%
It's like very Las
Vegas here, isn't it?

00:33:38.982 --> 00:33:39.792 align:middle line:90%
It's very funny.

00:33:39.792 --> 00:33:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I want
you to do is I just

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.750 align:middle line:84%
want you to think
of your brother.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And just let him guide
you into pulling out

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
a card that's right
for you at this moment.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
You're can ask him a question
in your mind if you want to.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
But however you feel guided.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:90%
These are guidance cards.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's just another tool.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.722 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you feel-- if you
want to spread them out more.

00:33:58.722 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And whenever you feel-- good.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.920 align:middle line:90%
So what does it say?

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.450 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I will always point
you in the right direction.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I will
always point you

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.548 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:34:08.548 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense to you?

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.643 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:34:10.643 --> 00:34:14.199 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you ask
him to be a guide of yours?

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've been
talking to guides lately,

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:90%
praying for help.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Praying for help.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.664 align:middle line:84%
Well I know that he's
a guide of yours.

00:34:19.664 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is very interesting
that you pulled that card.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.882 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
no accidents in life.

00:34:23.882 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are
no accidents in life.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.215 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we're guided and we're

00:34:27.215 --> 00:34:28.610 align:middle line:90%
led to where we have to be.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just separate
your brother here.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.499 align:middle line:90%
He's talking to me about horses.

00:34:32.499 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to talk
about the horses.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.360 align:middle line:84%
The horseback riding
or the horses.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.394 align:middle line:90%
You know about that, don't you?

00:34:36.394 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:38.139 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did
you do that younger.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:84%
When you were younger
was there something--

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Because he's bringing back
a memory of the horses

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.039 align:middle line:90%
and riding horses.

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I also will tell you that
there was another place

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.509 align:middle line:90%
that the family used to gather.

00:34:47.509 --> 00:34:48.550 align:middle line:90%
So there's another place.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.008 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, there's another
house or another summer house

00:34:51.008 --> 00:34:52.845 align:middle line:84%
or something that the
family used to go to.

00:34:52.845 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:84%
So he's talking
to me about that.

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.904 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I've got to
tell you with your brother,

00:34:57.904 --> 00:35:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you,
definitely his soul feels

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:90%
as if he had to go when he went.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.358 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who
in the family was

00:35:04.358 --> 00:35:06.276 align:middle line:84%
the person that was
missing the finger.

00:35:06.276 --> 00:35:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Had the accident
with the finger,

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:90%
or they sliced a finger, or.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, Connie.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.644 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Connie.

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hurt her finger.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hurt her finger.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Did she slice a finger?

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.577 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And is
that a sister of yours?

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
my ex mother-in-law.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
your ex mother-in-law.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And she's passed over to
the world of the spirit

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:90%
or she's still here?

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, she's here.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's still here.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Did you recently see her?

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that
you're helping her?

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, I hope so.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He said
you're helping her.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's talking about
you helping other people.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:84%
You're helping yourself
by helping others.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with him.

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.131 align:middle line:84%
Now, he wants me to tell you,
he has all his hair back.

00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why his hair
was an issue with him,

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.290 align:middle line:84%
but he said he has a full
head of hair, it's back, OK?

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your dad was there
with him when he passed over.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.646 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for the memorial.

00:35:49.646 --> 00:35:51.020 align:middle line:84%
There's something
with a memorial

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and he's telling me about that.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: For dad.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: For your dad.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:90%
He's telling me about that.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
It was a big deal.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It was a big deal.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Is it outside?

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.255 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is this
memorial thing outside?

00:36:01.255 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What is
it, a tree or a rock?

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Or what?

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.508 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's close.

00:36:04.508 --> 00:36:05.235 align:middle line:90%
It's under trees.

00:36:05.235 --> 00:36:07.216 align:middle line:90%
But it's his headstone.

00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:09.262 align:middle line:90%
And just we went back for him.

00:36:09.262 --> 00:36:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's beautiful.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:11.271 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:36:11.271 --> 00:36:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
just beautiful.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.431 align:middle line:90%
And do you have two children?

00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have four.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Four children.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:17.925 align:middle line:90%
Are there two and two?

00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Like two separate from you
and two with you, or something

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:20.700 align:middle line:90%
like this?

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No,
they're all with me.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.397 align:middle line:84%
But there are two that
are very close in age.

00:36:24.397 --> 00:36:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and
they're the two older.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.821 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So the
two that are younger,

00:36:28.821 --> 00:36:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why he's
connecting with-- your brother's

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.159 align:middle line:84%
connecting with one
of the little ones.

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:34.200 align:middle line:90%
I've gotta tell you that.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.875 align:middle line:84%
And that they see him, one
of them sees him spiritually.

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.791 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very interesting.

00:36:39.791 --> 00:36:42.804 align:middle line:84%
I've also got a German
Shepherd around you here.

00:36:42.804 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Didn't
your family have

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:90%
a German Shepherd at one time.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Or you had one in the past?

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, we're looking
at buying one right now.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, you are?

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.126 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got to tell you,
the German Shepherd is around.

00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
a German Shepherd.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a female
German Shepherd.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just lost my
dog, like a couple months ago.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.755 align:middle line:90%
But she wasn't a German.

00:36:59.755 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:90%
She was just a big girl.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
regarding your brother,

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:05.790 align:middle line:84%
was there something
about his passing?

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:90%
He keeps on coming into me here.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And I feel very strong with him.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
tell you, I feel

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that something isn't right about
the death in that something

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.190 align:middle line:90%
feels off about my passing.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.662 align:middle line:84%
Or something feels
mysterious or something's

00:37:19.662 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:84%
a little strange
about the passing.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.053 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:37:23.053 --> 00:37:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
actually have two brothers.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know which one.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
just say yes or no.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, OK, great.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.381 align:middle line:84%
So it's the one
brother here that I'm

00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:84%
getting that's either the death
was-- either someone wasn't

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:33.514 align:middle line:84%
saying fully everything
that happened.

00:37:33.514 --> 00:37:35.054 align:middle line:84%
Or there were some
circumstances that

00:37:35.054 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
were very strange
around the passing.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:37.805 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:37:37.805 --> 00:37:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes or no?

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, sorry, yes.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.759 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And I also have a
grandmother here.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you,
I see a blanket.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.575 align:middle line:90%
I see a blanket.

00:37:45.575 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I don't know
if you have a blanket of hers,

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:90%
but there's a blanket.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have her blanket?

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you,
thank you very much.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.330 align:middle line:90%
I love your enthusiasm.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is great,
really great.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:57.229 align:middle line:90%
And I know that-- go on.

00:37:57.229 --> 00:37:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Your dad wants to say
hello to you as well.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi, daddy.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that I like airplanes.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:02.160 align:middle line:90%
There is an airplane.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking
over the airplanes.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if he drove
or flew airplanes at one time,

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.151 align:middle line:84%
or was in the Air
Force or something,

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:90%
but I'm with airplanes.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, well,
it's actually Richard.

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:12.760 align:middle line:84%
My dad that's alive
that was the pilot.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.839 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, oh, OK.

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.505 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your
brother's talking

00:38:16.505 --> 00:38:18.710 align:middle line:84%
about the man that's
alive still, his father?

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:21.080 align:middle line:90%
So his father's still here?

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, wait.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't
know your family.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They're complete
strangers to me.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.058 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
your brother would

00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:29.754 align:middle line:84%
know about the
man that's flying?

00:38:29.754 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.319 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would his
father be the pilot?

00:38:32.319 --> 00:38:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, he's not.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:90%
He's not.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you have a
different father, two fathers?

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.835 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
step-father and real father.

00:38:37.835 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
step-father's passed over?

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, the
step-father is here.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:90%
That's Richard.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's Richard.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:84%
He's the one with the
pilot and the planes.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.603 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:38:44.603 --> 00:38:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And your natural
father's passed over.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I've just got to
make sure who I have here.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It's confusing, I know.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's confusing.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, talking to dead people.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's very confusing.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know who Michael is,
but there's a Michel as well?

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
my father's brother.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:38:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
father's brother.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about Michael.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So I imagine Michael's still
on the earth over here.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he's here.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.675 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But he's
watching over Michael.

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I've
got to tell you that.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And is there a wedding
that's coming up soon?

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.929 align:middle line:90%
Or a wedding that just passed?

00:39:09.929 --> 00:39:11.554 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something
about a wedding.

00:39:11.554 --> 00:39:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My cousin's
getting married.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
cousin's getting married.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That's a wedding.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And my
sister might be.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.380 align:middle line:84%
She says she is, but
I don't believe her.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm sorry.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.491 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My sister says she
is, but I don't believe her.

00:39:22.491 --> 00:39:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But there's
definitely a wedding coming up.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a wedding
that's been there.

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's what
my dad would probably

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.680 align:middle line:90%
be concerned about.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, there's
definitely the wedding thing

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:90%
there happening.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.023 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:39:30.023 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you were young, was
there any figure skating?

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.464 align:middle line:84%
Or do you understand
about skating on the ice?

00:39:34.464 --> 00:39:35.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that, don't you?

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:37.305 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because this man here

00:39:37.305 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
is talking to me about
you skating on the ice.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.610 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big deal.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:42.305 align:middle line:84%
And I even know that
there's much to say

00:39:42.305 --> 00:39:43.170 align:middle line:90%
as movies that were taken.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.268 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand
about the movies of you.

00:39:46.268 --> 00:39:48.544 align:middle line:84%
Movies, look what I'm
doing, movies, right?

00:39:48.544 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there'd be
movies or video-- they wouldn't

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.501 align:middle line:84%
be really movies-- of you when
you were skating when you were

00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:84%
a young girl, around
9, 10 years of age,

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.030 align:middle line:90%
around that time period.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want you to know
that you will have another dog.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Your dog is fine.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.366 align:middle line:90%
Your big dog is here.

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.656 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give you with
your brother and your dad

00:40:04.656 --> 00:40:05.310 align:middle line:90%
and your mom.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And don't want you to
give up on yourself.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.835 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're doing--
who does photography?

00:40:09.835 --> 00:40:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother, John.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you let him know that he's
being helped in the spirit

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.800 align:middle line:90%
world with the photography?

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And there's
going to be a showing.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be a showing.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know that he desires

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:90%
to have some kind of a showing.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.845 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to happen.

00:40:19.845 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.726 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Heather.

00:40:22.726 --> 00:40:23.976 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:40:23.976 --> 00:40:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Give me a hug.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.224 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Heather.

00:40:28.224 --> 00:40:30.628 align:middle line:84%
See how Heather
was enthusiastic?

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:31.128 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Best way you can
be when you receive

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
a message from the spirit
world is really just to be open

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and to receive whatever
they want to say.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we are here
to receive from them.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So I want to ask you if there's
a man standing next to you.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Was there a father figure
that passed over here?

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.735 align:middle line:90%
Or next to this person, no?

00:40:50.735 --> 00:40:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My
great grandfather.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.401 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your grandfather.

00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to ask
somebody, who's Jimmy?

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: James
was my grandfather.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Jim Lamb.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.899 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Jimmy, James.

00:41:01.899 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he got through Jim.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Did at one time he help to
raise you, or come by you,

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.669 align:middle line:84%
or influence at all
in your lifetime?

00:41:07.669 --> 00:41:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was my
grandfather's father.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.506 align:middle line:84%
And he passed away when
my grandfather was young.

00:41:11.506 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
did you not know him?

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And so
I didn't know him.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.104 align:middle line:84%
But my grandfather started a
business with his name on it.

00:41:19.104 --> 00:41:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
is that Jimmy's?

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Jim Lamb, yeah.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's the
name of the business?

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it was Jim, yeah.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:25.168 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:41:25.168 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Jimmy or
Jim very clearly.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
would be significant.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:90%
But I have him here.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.370 align:middle line:84%
But I also have another
person coming in here.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.127 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
figure who this is.

00:41:34.127 --> 00:41:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But I know I'm connected
with this gentleman here.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys related?

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:38.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: This is my husband.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I thought
it might be your husband.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.745 align:middle line:84%
I thought you weren't
sitting with a stranger here.

00:41:41.745 --> 00:41:43.362 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to--
what's your name?

00:41:43.362 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Zach.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:44.861 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Zach.

00:41:44.861 --> 00:41:46.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, Zach, great.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady here
who knows of you.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.770 align:middle line:84%
This is a woman
who knows of you.

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, I feel there's a woman
here who's connected with here.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if this is
your mom that's passed over

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.755 align:middle line:84%
or your grandma,
mother's mother.

00:41:58.755 --> 00:41:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother.

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:90%
My mother's mother.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did she
help to be influential to you

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.350 align:middle line:84%
when you were a
young boy, please?

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh yes.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I know as I
connect with this woman,

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that I
was influential with you

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.530 align:middle line:90%
when you were growing up.

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:84%
She's taking all the credit for
making you who you are today.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.117 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:19.117 --> 00:42:20.491 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she would, yes?

00:42:20.491 --> 00:42:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know she likes--

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:84%
she's your mother's
mother, she's telling me.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.499 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mother's mother.

00:42:25.499 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:84%
She's making it very
clear, mother's mother.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:84%
She's making that
very, very clear.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she comes,
and she's very strong.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "I
want to be noticed!"

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:90%
She wants to be noticed.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.618 align:middle line:84%
And I like spirits like
that, because then they

00:42:36.618 --> 00:42:38.610 align:middle line:84%
can really get in
and do some stuff.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So I know that she
says many, many things.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I know when she's
a young woman, she

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:84%
has to be strong for
the whole family.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I know that she was by herself.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.734 align:middle line:84%
When she was a young girl,
she was all by herself.

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she had
to make her life by herself.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.095 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that
made her very strong.

00:42:55.095 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I've
got to tell you.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.586 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's also talking
about, "I couldn't trust men."

00:42:58.586 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:84%
She goes, "I
couldn't trust them.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't trust them."

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
her personality.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't trust them.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:84%
That's how she's
saying it to me.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that there were
some accidents in the family.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I know people died
young in lifetime.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.560 align:middle line:90%
They didn't last the full time.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.210 align:middle line:84%
I know she had a lot of grieving
and a lot of death in her life

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.864 align:middle line:90%
from her relatives around her.

00:43:15.864 --> 00:43:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also think she
must have lost a child herself.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you'd
have to find that out.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.913 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I've got to tell you

00:43:23.913 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that I feel a lot of
grief with this lady.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But she comes in not only
for you, but for everybody

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:90%
here in the audience.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.502 align:middle line:84%
And for the people
that are watching.

00:43:31.502 --> 00:43:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And lets you know that, indeed,
I've been listening to you,

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.070 align:middle line:90%
I've been listening.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's a busybody.

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:37.284 align:middle line:90%
She's a nosy buddy.

00:43:37.284 --> 00:43:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She comes in
and she always points herself

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:90%
at people's information.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.694 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is what
she's telling me.

00:43:43.694 --> 00:43:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you like--
what are you saying to me.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there she is, OK.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.272 align:middle line:90%
Hi, grandma.

00:43:51.272 --> 00:43:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She said,
you were very different

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.404 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of them.

00:43:54.404 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You didn't
fit in with the rest

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.090 align:middle line:84%
of your people, the
rest of your siblings.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.237 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't either.

00:43:59.237 --> 00:43:59.820 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.486 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:00.486 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, why are
you around some toxic smells?

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Or she says something
you're around.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.355 align:middle line:90%
Are there sprays?

00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you try
to do it with artwork

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.170 align:middle line:84%
or you're trying
to do something.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:11.645 align:middle line:84%
with-- I don't know what you're
doing with these cans of paint.

00:44:11.645 --> 00:44:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
understand what this means?

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What is this?

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:14.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I have
hobbies of doing modeling.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.930 align:middle line:90%
And also I am a filmmaker.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And I do mess with chemicals.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
very recently--

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I assume
it was the editing--

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, use a
microphone so we can hear you.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.146 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Sorry, I assume it's
up in Boulder with the cleaning

00:44:30.146 --> 00:44:30.680 align:middle line:90%
of all the--

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
just a cleaning

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.752 align:middle line:90%
off old film and stuff.

00:44:35.752 --> 00:44:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spraying.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:38.959 align:middle line:84%
I'm spraying, and I'm spraying
some paints and things.

00:44:38.959 --> 00:44:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you have
to protect yourself.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:90%
You haven't done that.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to talk to
you about the firewood.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a wood
fireplace or something.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.056 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:49.056 --> 00:44:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she loves the firewood

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and burning the fires, and
having a nice little fireplace.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:55.040 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to tell you that.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.956 align:middle line:90%
She's always with you.

00:44:55.956 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:90%
She's very strong.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And she says,
believe in yourself.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.322 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're a director
or you will be a director.

00:45:01.322 --> 00:45:03.530 align:middle line:84%
I know that's either a goal
of yours, she said to me.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you're going
to make it as a director.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.350 align:middle line:90%
You just keep going for it.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And look out for the name
of Cooper, C-o-o-p-e-r.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the name of Cooper
is going to help you.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, God bless.

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.235 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: All
right, thank you.

00:45:17.235 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.959 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.959 --> 00:45:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, I want
to thank you all very,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:90%
very much for being here.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I hope today helped
you to realize or remember

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:90%
that indeed there is no death.

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:90%
There's only life.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.117 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all
very, very much.

00:45:34.117 --> 00:45:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And you at home, thank you also.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.074 align:middle line:84%
Realize that when
it's your time to go,

00:45:37.074 --> 00:45:38.530 align:middle line:90%
there is no such thing as death.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:39.640 align:middle line:90%
There's only life.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So may the light and
love of the spirit world

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.710 align:middle line:90%
always be with you.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye, everyone.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.920 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:50.920 --> 00:46:03.400 align:middle line:90%
