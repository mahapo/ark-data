>>EMCEE: And now, world-renowned
spirit medium James Van Praagh.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.975 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone!

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:90%
Hi!

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Hi!

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Ay!

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.497 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.204 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, everyone,
for joining me today

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.827 align:middle line:84%
on Spirit Talk, where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
In today's show, I thought we'd
do something which we have not

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.326 align:middle line:90%
done yet on this show.

00:00:47.326 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people have
been emailing and asking

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:90%
for this information.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I would
share it with all of you.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.368 align:middle line:84%
So if you look around my
set here, what do you see?

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Stars.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Stars, kind
of like a galaxy, right?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting--
planets, perhaps?

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like lost in
space, lost in time right here.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.655 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to tell you
that you as a spiritual being,

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
you come back here
for human experience.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back here,
one of the first things that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
happens is, before
we come back here,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we have-- we talk to our
guides and our teachers,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and we go through a blueprint
of the different lessons

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:90%
that our soul is going to learn.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And through our guides and
teachers, we will actually--

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
or they will help us to
pick out the perfect timing

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
for our birth in order for
various lessons to occur, OK?

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
98% percent of us is
water, made of water.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very easy
to be pulled by gravity.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.104 align:middle line:84%
Well as you know, all
around us are planets, yes?

00:01:46.104 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to throw
something at you,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.355 align:middle line:84%
and for you at home also,
to just think about.

00:01:51.355 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
What about if I was to tell you
that this is not the only place

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.977 align:middle line:90%
you go to?

00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you think of that?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Wild, huh?

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
only star system.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
There's only one-- OK,
are you ready for it?

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Millions and millions and
millions of star systems.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
This is only one, one planet,
in millions and millions

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:90%
of star systems.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit people
often say that when

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
you think of the Earth
world, think of it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
like a grain of sand on a beach,
just to give you a perspective.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that wild?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit, bit wild, yes?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:90%
You're like this.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a, whoa!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
looking at it that way,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
it shows you that
there's so much more

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
going on than we're
just aware of.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.351 align:middle line:84%
There's so much more out
there than we're aware of.

00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And when spirit people
come back and speak

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.151 align:middle line:84%
through me, many times
they'll say-- well,

00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
they don't say it
exactly like this,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.281 align:middle line:84%
but I know what
they're trying to say.

00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they're trying to say
I kind of have to dumb it down

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
for the human, because
the human comprehension is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%
very limited in many ways.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we are coming back on
this Earth, our birth time,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
we really are set up
with the various planets

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, because
every single planet will

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
have a gravitational pull on a
certain part of our bodies, OK?

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, you've
heard of the expression,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:90%
what's your sign?

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:90%
What's your sun sign?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:90%
What time were you born?

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it really, really
matters, down to the second

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:90%
that you're born.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it
matters down to the second

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.871 align:middle line:84%
that you're born is because
all the planets move.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Every second they're
moving, they're

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
in a different position.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're in a
different degree,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:90%
which in turn affects your body.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It affects the
gravitational pull.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
through each sign,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's a general
characteristic.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not an
astrologer per se,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot more
involved in your chart.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But just generally, let's
see what the energies are.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to first
start off with Capricorns,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:90%
and that's December, January.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.148 align:middle line:84%
How many Capricorns do
we have in the audience?

00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three, four.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.202 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm going to tell you
a little bit about Capricorn.

00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Hm, Capricorn is a sign, of
course, which is really--

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
they've come back
for karmic reasons.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We all come back
for karmic reasons,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
but Capricorns tend to have a
little bit more karmic reasons

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:90%
to come back.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems that Capricorn is ruled
by the planet Saturn, which

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:90%
is karma.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And the first 30 years
of a Capricorn's life,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
usually the most difficult ones.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn tends to be the
adult when they're the child.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Because they've come back from
a former lifetime where they

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.136 align:middle line:84%
had to-- something
happened, and they

00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
have to come back
with-- in a way,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
burning off the karma
from a past life

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:84%
right away within
their first 30 years.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
live this life.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So all you Capricorns, I don't
know if you realize that,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
but you were full
of responsibility

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.730 align:middle line:90%
when you were a young kid.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You might have had
to be the adult

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.034 align:middle line:84%
when you were a
kid, whether it's

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:90%
emotional or physical or mental.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Sense.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Sense.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.782 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn also rules
the bones, the bones,

00:04:45.782 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:90%
so be careful with the bones.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
That's the area it rules.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Capricorns are all
about security,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.422 align:middle line:90%
security of the future.

00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Got to have retirement.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Got to have money in the bank.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Security, security, security.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they've
got to be careful,

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
because security might
rule their lives.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And they get off their paths,
because they get blinded

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:90%
by that.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's Capricorn,
very secure conscious.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.654 align:middle line:90%
I was married to one.

00:05:05.654 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of the Capricorn.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then we have Aquarius.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.886 align:middle line:84%
How many people
are Aquarius here?

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:90%
One Aquarian?

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Just one Aquarian?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.644 align:middle line:90%
One crazy person, perfect .

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:15.714 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:15.714 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, see?

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Now I can say that to another
sign, like Capricorn, and say,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.481 align:middle line:90%
you're crazy.

00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:20.189 align:middle line:90%
They go, uh-uh.

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And they'd worry
and go, no, I'm not.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.105 align:middle line:84%
But Aquarius you
can say that to,

00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.314 align:middle line:84%
because Aquarians go
by their own time.

00:05:25.314 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own sense of time.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't fit into the
regular, everyday life.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:90%
They do things in their own way.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the most unique
sign of the zodiac.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.987 align:middle line:84%
And it is really
the light bearer.

00:05:33.987 --> 00:05:35.986 align:middle line:84%
I know they're the water
bearer, but they really

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:90%
show people the light.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
They will, if you will,
they're the great teachers

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
They will really bring
in new ways of thinking

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and new ways of doing
things-- great scientists,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
great explorers, great thinkers.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:90%
They're great thinkers.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Lincoln, great
thinker, great Aquarian.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So they go do things in
their own time, all right?

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So never try to fit in
if you're an Aquarian.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Never try to fit into every
day's time and everyone else's

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.168 align:middle line:90%
Because you never will.

00:06:02.168 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you try that, it
will go against the grain

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense, right?

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the sign, which
is the most independent sign

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So you need to give the
gregarious Aquarius some room

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:90%
to grow, some room to expand.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
They need their own space.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.460 align:middle line:84%
If you give them their own
space, the happier they'll be.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, Aquarians rule the
circulation system, OK?

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Circulation system, so you
always should be running.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.124 align:middle line:84%
Motion-- you know,
healing is motion, running

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
is motion, movement.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Movement is motion is healing.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Aquarians-- they're the life of
the party if they want to be.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't like you,
they can go, [BLOWS OUT]

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.892 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally pull away
and be like stone, right?

00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
not good or bad.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.087 align:middle line:84%
It just is generalities
of the sign.

00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense to you.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Capricorn, Aquarius,
and then next we have Pisces.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Pisces.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:90%
One Pisces, two Pisces.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I usually can
tell a Pisces right away,

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
because Pisces has--
they have beautiful eyes.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.370 align:middle line:84%
They have dreamlike
eyes, Pisces.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Pisces is a sign, which
is the martyr sign, which

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is, they come back and
they kind of sometimes

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:90%
feel sorry for themselves.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.765 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's like,
oh, I'm too sensitive,

00:07:15.765 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and they're very,
very sensitive,

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:84%
the most sensitive sign
of the zodiac, yeah?

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:90%
And they do rule the feet.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So the feet is the very
sensitive part, Pisces.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting,
because a Pisces--

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:90%
they are very, very psychic.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
They're the most psychic
sign of the zodiac.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
interesting, because it

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
is said that because
the feet rule Pisces,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
they are stepping on the
vibrations of all the Earth.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're picking up
everybody's vibrations.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.217 align:middle line:84%
So you know, Pisces is a natural
psychic, a natural sensitive.

00:07:44.217 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
They have their heads in
the stars and the clouds.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:90%
They're very dreamlike.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
They cannot relate necessarily
to this Earth life.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
They feel like, I
don't belong here.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I don't belong here, right?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And so they've got to be
careful, like all signs,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
to integrate
properly and balance.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.265 align:middle line:90%
I like Pisces.

00:07:59.265 --> 00:08:01.265 align:middle line:84%
I have a great-- the
energy with Pisces, I like.

00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I like Pisces very much.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.442 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my good friends
are Piscean energy.

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the next
thing after Pisces,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:90%
then we have is-- anybody?

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Aries.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Aries.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:90%
Very good, Aries.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.425 align:middle line:90%
And who-- are you an Aries?

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Who's Aries ?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Anybody Aries?

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:90%
One Aries, two Aries?

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Aries, great.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.236 align:middle line:90%
Love Aries.

00:08:18.236 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And again, I'm not judging.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:90%
This is just--

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.196 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Aries
is the "I am" sign.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So Aries is ruled
by the Sun, yes.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is-- there
it is, that big thing,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and it lights on me.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's the baby of astrology,
in that the Aries tend

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to be seeing things from
their point of view,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
from my own point of view,
where Pisces is the opposite,

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:90%
is everybody's point of view.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So Aries can tend to--
the baby of the zodiac.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:90%
They're learning by doing.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So Aries will-- they're
ruled by the head.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So some Aries can be very
headstrong and jump into things

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and later say, oops, I
shouldn't have done that.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Make sense to you?

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
calm and collected.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
They're very cool, ruled
by the planet Mars.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.295 align:middle line:84%
They can be very cool
and calm until someone

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:90%
pushes their buttons.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And [SCREAMS], and
then they're warlike.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
But then they calm down
again, and they're fine.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And they don't tend
to hold grudges.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
She's laughing, so
I know I got you.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.935 align:middle line:90%
Does it makes sense to you?

00:09:16.935 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And Aries, by the way,
is the hardest sign

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.719 align:middle line:84%
of the zodiac, hardest
working sign of the zodiac.

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:22.635 align:middle line:90%
They really work hard.

00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:23.496 align:middle line:90%
They're headstrong.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
They'll get into a job, and
no better workers than Aries.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:90%
They're really hard workers.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Rules the head, so be
careful of headaches

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and these sorts of things.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when you're
overdoing things, Aries,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're so stressed out,
you tend to get headaches.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
That's your sign that
you're overdoing it,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.155 align:middle line:90%
and you need to balance, right?

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Just like all the other signs I
was talking about, like Pisces.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You start to have feet
problems, you're overdoing it.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Just calm down,
balance yourself.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And so it works with all
these different signs.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.255 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
March-April, would be Aries.

00:09:51.255 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And then what do we have
after that, anybody?

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Taurus.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Taurus!

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Taurus, the Bull.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.470 align:middle line:90%
Anybody Taurus here?

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Taurus.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Taurus.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:90%
No one over here?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who you people are.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.834 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:90%
Different planet, OK.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Different star system.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:90%
So Taurus.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Taurus is a
sign, a very fixed sign.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And people say it's
a stubborn sign.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think Taurus is really
the most physical sign

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:16.761 align:middle line:90%
It's an earth sign.

00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very earthy, very tactile.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.304 align:middle line:84%
Earth sign of Taurus,
very-- you know

00:10:22.304 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
what you're going to get
with a Taurus person.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They'll tell you
exactly what it is.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the way it is
whether you like it or not.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.211 align:middle line:90%
This is my point of view.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's it, right?

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
physical people.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.882 align:middle line:90%
And they like good food.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:84%
They like everything
food, very physical.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:90%
They like good sex.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And they like good art.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.396 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they say.

00:10:38.396 --> 00:10:39.854 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go there with you.

00:10:39.854 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's really-- and Taurus
is, believe it or not,

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.817 align:middle line:84%
it is the sign of
the most beautiful,

00:10:45.817 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
usually the most beautiful,
physical sign of the zodiac,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.566 align:middle line:84%
because they're
the most physical.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to be
very good looking.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:90%
It also rules the throat area.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Taurus rules the throat.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So many Taureans,
even though they're

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
a fixed sign and they
have their point of view,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
they might have a hard
time expressing it.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And they keep it
in their throat.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So they'll keep
everything in, choking.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So any time you have
a sore throat, Taurus,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:90%
you're not expressing yourself.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
express yourself more.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And don't be afraid
of hurting somebody.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Because Taurus can use tact.

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:90%
They have tact.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.336 align:middle line:84%
They can express something in
a way that people receive it,

00:11:19.336 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
and they don't hurt people.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.459 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So after that, that would
be, April-May, and then we

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:90%
have the sign of May-June.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Gemini.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Gemini.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%
How many Geminis?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.782 align:middle line:90%
One, two.

00:11:32.782 --> 00:11:33.281 align:middle line:90%
Two.

00:11:33.281 --> 00:11:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Two Geminis.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And my camera operator
is a double Gemini,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
because I just
looked at his chart.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Gemini.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.019 align:middle line:90%
Wow, one, two, three, four.

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:90%
So we have eight Geminis.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.366 align:middle line:90%
Ah, ha ha ha.

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:90%
The twin sign.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
See what I'm-- that's
the joke, the twin sign.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So Gemini, yeah. with
the twins, they say.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, Gemini, yes.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ruling the stomach.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So Gemini tends to rule
the lungs, by the way.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.985 align:middle line:90%
And also the hands.

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And they tend--
it's a sign ruled

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
by Mercury, the planet Mercury.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is the sign
for communication.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So Geminis are usually
great communicators.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
They are the communicators
of the zodiac, great writers,

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
great orators.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:90%
They'll just express themselves.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And Gemini is also,
and you'll know this,

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.572 align:middle line:84%
is the butterfly of
the cosmos, in that,

00:12:15.572 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:84%
you have that going on, that
going on, that going on,

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that going on, and that
going on, like three

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.696 align:middle line:90%
things, four things at once.

00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it works.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So the butterfly of the cosmos.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Now another sign that comes
back like Taurus, let's say,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
they come back and learn lessons
from the beginning, the middle,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:90%
and the end.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Not Gemini.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Gemini touches the surface.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:90%
They're the butterflies.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.830 align:middle line:90%
They flutter in.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
They get the
experience, and move on.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they're
not really in depth.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
They're just very
surface, Gemini.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Because their minds
work very quickly.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
They're always thinking
of something else.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have time
to be really in depth.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:90%
They're always thinking.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.982 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that right, Ellie, yes.

00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Our production
people are Geminis--

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:90%
of course, communication.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's Gemini,
rules the lungs

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and the hands, very
good-- sometimes Gemini,

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
they've got to stop for a
moment and really listen,

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:90%
listen to people.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes they're
very busy speaking

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:90%
that they don't hear, yeah?

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's Gemini.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But great writers, great
musicians, really, really

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:90%
good with that.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's May-June, and
then we have June-July.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:90%
What's the next sign?

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Cancer.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:90%
How many Cancers?

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Cancers can raise their hands.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Do we have any Cancers?

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:90%
No Cancers?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.096 align:middle line:90%
Good, let's talk about them.

00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:23.192 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:23.192 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Are you a Cancer?

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:90%
No, you're Pisces.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Pisces.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.029 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her husband.

00:13:27.029 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
husband, Cancer.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So Cancer is the sign
which is the crab, yes?

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.296 align:middle line:84%
The crab, you know, crawls
this way, crawls that way,

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
crawls this way,
crawls that way,

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:84%
doesn't go directly to the
water, but goes around.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.417 align:middle line:84%
So Cancers are really the
sign which is a nurturer.

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:90%
It's the nurturer of the zodiac.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They're the mothers
of the zodiac.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.850 align:middle line:90%
They rule the house.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:90%
They rule the family.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Anything to do with the
family is very Cancerean,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
nurturing people, very
sweet and soft people.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Soft meat on the inside,
hard shell on the outside.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So Cancer is a very-- in
some ways very secretive.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't like to reveal
things about themselves.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason is
because they're so sensitive.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're afraid to
show their sensitivity.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Cancerean, yes, right?

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:90%
So after Cancer then we have?

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.879 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Leo.

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leos!

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Now there's got to be more
than two Leos in this audience.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And you're the cusp,
like I am, Leo.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Leo is ruled by the Sun.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:90%
The Sun and Leo.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.612 align:middle line:84%
So Leo is the
self-expression, here I am,

00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:90%
it's the biggest thing.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:90%
The sun has illumination.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It's expression.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Leo rules showmanship.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:90%
So it rules entertainment.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I have four planets in Leo, if
you can't tell that, here I am.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's really expression.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They're all learning about
expression in this lifetime,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Leos.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.384 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very loyal people,
as loyal as the day is long.

00:14:46.384 --> 00:14:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But they also many times wear
their heart on their sleeve,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.025 align:middle line:90%
and they tend to get hurt.

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they look at
things from their heart.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.167 align:middle line:90%
And you understand this.

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Are you a Leo, then?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So you know this.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:90%
So you're a Leo.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
But really, really
great friends.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Leo is ruling the heart area,
so be careful about the heart,

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fire sign.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And Leos are very good
and right there for you,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes they'll
tell little lies.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.474 align:middle line:84%
And they tell little
lies, not to hurt anyone,

00:15:11.474 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
but they really want
people to feel good

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
about themselves or
about a situation,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
so they'll kind of make
it the best way they can,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and they maneuver the
truth a little bit.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.505 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense to you?

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:20.005 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's Leo, yeah.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:90%
And then after Leo we have?

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Virgo.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.898 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Virgo, correct.

00:15:24.898 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Virgo, Virgo.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:90%
So I'm on the cusp, August 23.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.340 align:middle line:84%
You're in the cusp,
August 24, you said.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:90%
So Virgos are great.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Any Virgos over here?

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Virgo.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's your mom?

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have Virgo and Pisces,
which get along really well,

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And you're a Virgo, OK.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So Virgo is a great
humanitarian sign.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a great humanitarian
sign in that we've come back

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
to help the humankind,
the human world.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
We've come back
usually of service.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sign for
service of humankind.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So many times they'll
come back-- Virgos

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
tend to come back
for medical work.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:90%
They'll be doctors.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
They'll be hospital
administrators.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They really work for helping
people, service of people.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Virgos do not mind
doing the grunt work.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:90%
They'll do the grunt work.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:90%
They'll help out.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll do the grunt
work as much they can.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And if they are loved by
doing that grunt work,

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.580 align:middle line:90%
they'll do more of it.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Because unfortunately,
with Virgos,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.187 align:middle line:84%
we tend to have a sense of
sometimes self-critical.

00:16:15.187 --> 00:16:16.770 align:middle line:84%
We sometimes can be
too self-critical,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.742 align:middle line:84%
self-critical of ourselves,
self-critical of other people.

00:16:19.742 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Because we're perfectionists.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:84%
We want things perfect,
even though there really

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.672 align:middle line:84%
isn't perfection,
except for love.

00:16:25.672 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We really try to want to have
perfection in our whole world

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.588 align:middle line:84%
around us, and
we'll do anything we

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:84%
can to make it look perfect, to
put things in a certain order.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:90%
We like order.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:90%
We do not like chaos.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:90%
That's Virgo.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Virgo rules the intestines.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's all about assimilation.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
It's assimilation
of information.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It's assimilation of
the world around you.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's putting things
in their proper place.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.605 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to be very
careful about the people

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
that you're hanging out with and
that you put around your sphere

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you will absorb, Virgos
will absorb all that energy

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
from other people
into our tummies.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So next time check
out who you're around.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have a bad
stomach, say hm,

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.173 align:middle line:84%
who was I hanging
out with today?

00:17:01.173 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because we tend to
take on their energy sometimes.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Wild.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So now after Virgo,
which is, then we have?

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Libra.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Libra.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Any Libras here?

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cusp.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cusp.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, Libra.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.347 align:middle line:90%
And you raised your hand.

00:17:13.347 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
You put your hand up, which
I'm very proud of you.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.276 align:middle line:90%
Any Libras over here?

00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
sign-- you're a Leo.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I know we have
one Leo and Virgo.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a Virgo.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you're a Virgo.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.315 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm a
Virgo, but you didn't

00:17:24.315 --> 00:17:25.994 align:middle line:84%
ask us to raise our
hands on this side.

00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:27.605 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.605 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You're incorporated

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:90%
in the whole group.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.541 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it right, Virgo.

00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Did it make sense about
the order, though?

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.414 align:middle line:90%
Things in order, obviously?

00:17:37.414 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
You just don't want to
admit it, but yeah, yeah.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.885 align:middle line:90%
A pain in the-- yes.

00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.259 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Us Virgos can be.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We can be real pains, getting
things just the right way.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:90%
So Libra, and no Libras here.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So Libra is the sign that
rules the kidneys, right?

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And Libra is really ruled
by the planet Venus, which

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:90%
is all about beauty, art, love.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
That's Libra.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.575 align:middle line:90%
They love love.

00:17:59.575 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:90%
They love to be in love.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:90%
They love to witness love.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And Libra, of course, is the
scales, balancing the scales.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So partnerships mean
a lot to Libras.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And they will get
whatever they want.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the iron
fist in the golden glove.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
They'll look nice and
pretty, but underneath that,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
they'll get exactly
what they want

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:90%
with the sweet smile and charm.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's Libra.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Libras tend to see the world
differently than most people.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They tend to see the
colors differently.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.913 align:middle line:84%
The value of color
for a Libra seems

00:18:27.913 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to be very, very different
than other people.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So the value of the
color red is very

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
different than Libran
eyes-- in Libran eyes

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:84%
than would be for a
Scorpio or a Virgo.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
It also rules artists, of
course, so great artists,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Libras, musicians, all the
arts, very creative people,

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
very good decorators
and designers.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
The part, the
negative with Libra,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
they have a hard time
making up their mind.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So they are the great
procrastinators.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:84%
They're great procrastinators
because they want everything

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.557 align:middle line:90%
to be in balance.

00:18:56.557 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult to get
things in balance all the time.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:90%
So they want things in balance.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes they don't
want to make a decision,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.223 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
make up their mind,

00:19:04.223 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
because it'll be a
little out of balance.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.021 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So, unfortunately,
they don't tend

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.993 align:middle line:84%
to get things done as
quickly as they should.

00:19:11.993 --> 00:19:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.120 align:middle line:90%
That's that.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so after Libra, and now
we're going October-November.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.765 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going into?

00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:18.598 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Scorpio.

00:19:18.598 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Scorpio.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:90%
How many Scorpios?

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand,
one, two, three.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.994 align:middle line:90%
No Scorpios here, OK.

00:19:24.994 --> 00:19:27.243 align:middle line:84%
I think I've got to move
people around, because this--

00:19:27.243 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This
side over here.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So we have two or three--
three Scorpios, right?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So Scorpio.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I love Scorpio.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio is a great sign.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
To me, personally,
I love Scorpio.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
It is the number one sign as
far as mediumship, as far as

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
talking to dead people, yes?

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones who
rule any of the unknown.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the most secretive
sign of the zodiac.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.847 align:middle line:84%
Because Scorpios,
they don't want--

00:19:48.847 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
they're very good at ferreting
out other people's information.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
They're natural
detectives, right?

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
They like to to
find out everything

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.468 align:middle line:90%
they can about somebody else.

00:19:55.468 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But they're not very good at
giving out their own stuff.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:90%
And so it rules the unknown.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:90%
It rules graveyards.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.448 align:middle line:84%
It rules anything
to do with death.

00:20:03.448 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
It rules just--
jails and prisons,

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and it rules all the
unknown stuff and stuff

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.927 align:middle line:90%
that goes on underneath society.

00:20:09.927 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of that sort of thing.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:90%
So they get really in depth.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio is a sign that
has all the positive traits

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.660 align:middle line:84%
of every other sign, like
Capricorn or Aquarius.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
They have all the
positive traits

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
of every other
sign and their own,

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and all the negative traits of
every other sign and their own.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So imagine how
intense they might be.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.874 align:middle line:84%
Scorpios-- where are
all the Scorpios?

00:20:30.874 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Right, intense, right?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Intense.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Intense.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They're always feeling, feeling,
feeling, more than a Pisces.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like Pisces on
steroids, Scorpio.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
They're so intense,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.250 align:middle line:90%
they pick up things so quickly.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
They can read people
like that, like that.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's Scorpio.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio can be the
highest spiritual sign

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac, or the lowest.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.905 align:middle line:90%
It's how you use the energy.

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It's how you decide to use
the energy you're given.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you're taking
on these signs, these birth

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.100 align:middle line:84%
signs, this sun sign,
to use that energy.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully you'll use
it in a positive way.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So some of the greatest
spiritual teachers of the world

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:90%
are Scorpio people.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:90%
So it really is.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, after Scorpio
we have Sagittarius.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.830 align:middle line:90%
Any Sages here?

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:90%
One Sag.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.817 align:middle line:90%
One Sag, OK.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get a
bigger audience, I think.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we have one Sag.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.706 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is the planet
that rules the sciatica.

00:21:23.706 --> 00:21:25.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, that whole
thing here with the leg.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sign
which is a traveller.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the mystic, the mystic.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
They love to travel the
world, like the bow and arrow,

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:90%
the arrow flies.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So they like to experience new
things, adventures, new people.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
They really do-- it's the
second sign of independence,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.610 align:middle line:84%
first being Aquarius, and
the second is Sagittarius.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
So don't box in the Sagittarius.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I need my space.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:90%
I need my independence.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of lessons
Sagittarians learn

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
are independent
lessons, capiche?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And I have a Sagittarius moon.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.856 align:middle line:84%
And so I know
Sagittarius very well.

00:21:59.856 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
It's actually my favorite
sign of the zodiac.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarians have,
unfortunately,

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.197 align:middle line:90%
foot-in-mouth disease.

00:22:06.197 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say exactly what
they think without thinking.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:90%
That's Sagittarians.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, doesn't
everybody else see it this way?

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you see
my point of view?

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:90%
This is just the way it is.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:90%
That's Sagittarian.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.505 align:middle line:84%
They don't mean to
hurt anybody, but this

00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:90%
is the way it is, you know?

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And I love their sense of humor.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I love the freedom
of Sagittarius.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And I love the energy
of Sagittarians.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:90%
So they're go, go, go, go.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have the fire
signs, then, which

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.787 align:middle line:90%
is Sagittarius is a fire sign.

00:22:29.787 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And we have Leo,
which is a fire sign.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have Aries, which
are all fire signs, OK?

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Fire signs do really, really
well when mixed with air signs,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
because those two
elements, fire and air,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.790 align:middle line:90%
really complement each other.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The air signs being
Aquarius, Libra, and Gemini.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have the fire
signs, which is Aries,

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and you have Leo, and
you have-- the other fire

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:90%
sign is Sagittarius.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a fire sign, go, go.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So the complementing signs
with the complementary energy

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%
or elements to that is air.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have Gemini and
Libra and Aquarius.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:90%
That's air, right?

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we have our water
signs, Scorpio and Pisces,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.932 align:middle line:90%
right, and Cancer.

00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:90%
So those are the water signs.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Those are the sensitive.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:90%
They feel things.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And what complements
the water signs?

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.640 align:middle line:90%
The earth signs.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have your
Virgo, down to earth.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
You have your Taurus,
down to earth.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:90%
And the last one is Capricorn.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's the other earth sign.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So earth elements and water
elements get along really,

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:90%
really well.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And fire elements
and air elements

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:90%
get along really, really well.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's your lesson
in the signs, OK?

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.954 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, yes?

00:23:37.954 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So next time when someone
asks you, what's your sign?

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.234 align:middle line:84%
You'll know a little
bit more about it.

00:23:46.234 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Or I guarantee everybody
in this audience,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.829 align:middle line:84%
when you meet people,
you're going to say,

00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:51.206 align:middle line:90%
what is your sign?

00:23:51.206 --> 00:23:52.396 align:middle line:90%
So it's interesting.

00:23:52.396 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
more knowledge you have,

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:90%
knowledge is power.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
where comes from, OK?

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.467 align:middle line:84%
Any questions before we
go into the next part?

00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:90%
You have a question?

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, stand up.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:90%
What's your name again?

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Julie.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Julie, OK.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.285 align:middle line:90%
What's your question?

00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My question
is, being on the cusp,

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.647 align:middle line:84%
I'm August 24, so I know I'm
both Leo as well as Virgo.

00:24:11.647 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Should I be focusing
on-- you said Leo earlier,

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leo-Virgo.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.033 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:24:19.033 --> 00:24:22.377 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Which one should
I be choosing to focus on?

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, when
you look at yourself,

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
you're really an integration
of both, some Leo energy

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and some Virgo energy,
which I'm the same thing,

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and I love that, because I
can express myself, like this,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
doing a show, and
also when details

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:84%
come through with my
readings, that's all Virgo.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:90%
That's details.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.955 align:middle line:84%
So I'm able to use
both those energies.

00:24:39.955 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you can do.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.996 align:middle line:90%
Use both the energies.

00:24:41.996 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:90%
So both will apply to you.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wonderful.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, sweetheart.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you've also got

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to realize that I just spoke
to you about the sun sign.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And remember that you really
are more than just the sun.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
There's all the planets
there in your chart as well.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
When you come back
on this earth,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:90%
the blueprint is a chart.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little chart,
and it looks like a pie.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:90%
And there are slices.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And each slice is
called a house.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And each house means
something as well.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Each house is in a
certain sign as well.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, most of my planets
are in a Pisces house,

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
which is a psychic house,
and a Scorpio house,

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:90%
which is the mediumship house.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:90%
So I am mediumistic and psychic.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:20.726 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:25:20.726 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:24.118 align:middle line:84%
And my moon-- I'm not going
to go into the moon sign,

00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
but the moon in your chart is
your emotions and feelings.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:90%
My moon is in Sagittarius.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So like I said
before, Sagittarius

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:90%
was the counselor, the mystic.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So I counsel people
about their emotions.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that wild?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So it makes sense.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking at
it, it makes a lot of sense.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So I thought we would just
get-- you have a question.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.046 align:middle line:90%
Please stand.

00:25:44.046 --> 00:25:45.587 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't
know how much you

00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:84%
know about love
relationships, but what

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.629 align:middle line:84%
are the chances of two
Capricorns making it together?

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, OK,
that's good question.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
When two Capricorns
come together,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.080 align:middle line:84%
so remember that's just the
sun sign you're speaking about.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to look
at the whole chart,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.695 align:middle line:84%
but I'd also like to look at
what the moon positions are.

00:25:58.695 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you
have moon in Cancer,

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and usually we're attracted
to another partner who

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
has an element which is good
with that other element.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.479 align:middle line:84%
So let's say the moon in
Cancer, that's a water sign.

00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
There'll maybe be an
earth sign that person

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.929 align:middle line:84%
has, moon in
Taurus, the partner.

00:26:12.929 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's two--
emotionally, the two

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.762 align:middle line:90%
get along really well that way.

00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:17.386 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
aspects of the chart

00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at
than just the sun signs.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you have two sun
signs in Capricorn together,

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:90%
good luck.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.615 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Besides cheap-- I'm

00:26:28.615 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
sorry, frugal, frugal, frugal,
frugal, frugal, frugal.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So Capricorns tend to be frugal.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:90%
They really do.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they tend
to love coupons.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But the two-for-one sales,
they love to do that.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
about the future.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about security.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.665 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I think
two Capricorns could

00:26:43.665 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:84%
work really well together,
financially great together.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if they don't
fight it out financially,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.080 align:middle line:84%
they'll work together at
keeping the finances straight.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.288 align:middle line:84%
They'll have all their
retirement stuff straightened.

00:26:53.288 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's all about organization
with them as well.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.555 align:middle line:90%
So I like Capricorns.

00:26:56.555 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They'll get the
job done as well.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.366 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do it in an
orderly and organized fashion.

00:27:00.366 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.531 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So if you can put
up with each other like that,

00:27:03.531 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm with a Virgo, and
two Virgos together, it's

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:90%
difficult.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.513 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's great, but
it's also difficult.

00:27:09.513 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's like
a bulldog and a basset

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:90%
hound coming together.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's
just the energies.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.343 align:middle line:84%
It's the energies
you're dealing with.

00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.499 align:middle line:84%
But again, the more you
know, the more aware

00:27:18.499 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:84%
you are of what the energies
of those signs mean,

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.100 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is for you to
understand and to work together

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.055 align:middle line:90%
to integrate.

00:27:24.055 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
you're welcome.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think now we're going
to do a little meditation.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I know everyone
at home loves meditation.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.432 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll love
the meditation.

00:27:31.432 --> 00:27:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want to do
a meditation today

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.240 align:middle line:84%
to really welcome the
spirit world to come

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.780 align:middle line:84%
into our awareness and to
bring them into the space, OK?

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.427 align:middle line:84%
So just-- if you sit there with
your eyes-- close your eyes.

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.754 align:middle line:84%
So I never know from
meditation to meditation

00:27:50.754 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:90%
really what I'm going to do.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So I just open myself
up to the spirit,

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and I let them really
come through me

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.422 align:middle line:90%
and provide this information.

00:27:57.422 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So people that are
watching this at home,

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:84%
also you'll feel
this information.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming to you and
people here in the audience.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Just gently close your eyes.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never meditated
before, don't worry.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no formal
way of doing this.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:90%
And I just want you to relax.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.990 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it is.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just taking a few
moments to be with yourself

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:90%
and just relaxing.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.395 align:middle line:84%
And as you set that intention
that I'm just going to relax,

00:28:25.395 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
be with myself.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.876 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.876 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to be
mindful of my feet

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:38.030 align:middle line:84%
on the floor, of my body, my
legs, my back in the chair,

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
my shoulders and my
arms, my neck, my head.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to have the awareness

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that you as a spirit, you as
a soul, who have come back

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to this human
level, you have been

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
here many, many,
many times before.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.460 align:middle line:84%
This is not the first
lifetime you've had,

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
you being part of that universe.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:84%
In a way, you're a
microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You're a mini satellite
system within you.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And just in your
mind, I just want

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you to-- in your
imagination, even,

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
create a little solar
system within your being.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.070 align:middle line:90%
And create any planets you like.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And at the heart of
those planets is the sun.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And for our purpose
today, I just

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.090 align:middle line:84%
want you to imagine that
that sun is placed right

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.040 align:middle line:84%
in your heart, and that
sun, that heart space,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
illuminates all
the other planets,

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.792 align:middle line:84%
illuminates all the
aspects of your being.

00:29:43.792 --> 00:29:47.026 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.026 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And let go of any old energy,
any old, stagnant energy,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:90%
let it go.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Let if go.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:29:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And envision that those planets
in your little solar system

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:84%
within you, each
one has a meaning.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps one is about love.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:90%
One is about giving.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one is about
understanding.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.045 align:middle line:90%
Maybe one is about forgiveness.

00:30:22.045 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe one is about
determination.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:84%
However you want to create
that inner solar system that

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.510 align:middle line:84%
moves around your
heart, your sun.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps these little planets
in your own solar system

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
are lessons, energetic
lessons you've come back

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:90%
to experience in this lifetime.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And as these planet slowly
move around the sun, the heart

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:84%
space, become aware, as
each one is illuminated

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:03.560 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, what
lessons are lit up?

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.540 align:middle line:90%
What energies are lit up?

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.720 align:middle line:84%
What do you need to
pay more attention to

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:84%
in your own sphere, in
your own solar system?

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Just being mindful
of what planets,

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.770 align:middle line:84%
what lessons in your
own solar system

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.565 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be more
aware of, more mindful of.

00:31:27.565 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And for just a second, being
aware of that beauty sun-heart

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:84%
energy, become part of
that beautiful sunlight

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:90%
in your heart.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And let that engulf
your entire being,

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and just feel love, the beauty
of love, the element of love.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And let that love infuse
into your whole being,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.950 align:middle line:84%
your whole solar system, feeling
those rays of light in who you

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you begin
to feel the connectedness

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to the one light,
to the God light,

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:17.040 align:middle line:90%
to the spark of the universe.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected
to that spark.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Whether that's right
above you, that's fine.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Just plug in and connect to
the oneness, to the purity,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.275 align:middle line:90%
to the light.

00:32:28.275 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you limited
your thoughts.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps you limited your way.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've become
distracted and forgot your path.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time for you
to remember your source.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:84%
You're plugged into that
source, and that source

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:90%
lets your universe move.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:58.198 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.198 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would just like you to
repeat verbally these words.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.964 align:middle line:90%
I am love.

00:33:05.964 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am love.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.145 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I am love.

00:33:10.145 --> 00:33:11.055 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.420 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I am love.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I am love.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.307 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And so it is.

00:33:18.307 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And so it is.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.066 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And as you sit
in that space, all around you

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
are the stars, coming into
light, coming into awareness.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It's in the darkness that we
look up and we see the stars.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the stars are
all of our loved ones

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.380 align:middle line:84%
who have passed over to
the world of the spirit.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And they come so
close to guide us.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Our loved ones are
our guiding stars.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:90%
And you are a part of them.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And they are part of
your whole solar system.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes, and be as one.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:56.982 align:middle line:90%


00:33:56.982 --> 00:33:57.984 align:middle line:90%
Did you enjoy that?

00:33:57.984 --> 00:33:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:33:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I really like doing that
today, particularly because

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.640 align:middle line:90%
of our set.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.370 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And it's a
meditation, really.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It's really a wonderful,
wonderful-- time and space,

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.600 align:middle line:90%
I guess would be right.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.199 align:middle line:84%
So I want to tune into
the spirit world around us

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:18.860 align:middle line:90%
and through us.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
And I know that all of us
wonder if they're around us.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:90%
They're always around us.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.544 align:middle line:84%
They're always behind
you, next to you.

00:34:23.544 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:90%
They're always influencing us.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:26.695 align:middle line:84%
I want to start with
this lady over here,

00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:28.320 align:middle line:84%
because I know I have
your mother here.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
your grandmother.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I know before I started the
show, I felt your mother here.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to continue
with her, because she would not

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.710 align:middle line:84%
let me continue to
show if I didn't

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:90%
continue with her message.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.840 align:middle line:90%
So I need to do that, OK?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.205 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing, please?

00:34:40.205 --> 00:34:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:41.739 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and
what is your name?

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Marie.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Marie, and you are?

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:43.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Jeanne.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.489 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you're
definitely mother and daughter?

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right, OK.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.178 align:middle line:84%
So I have your mother
and father here, OK?

00:34:48.178 --> 00:34:49.719 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell
you that, all right?

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:51.802 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to tell
you about-- your mother

00:34:51.802 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
is very much aware of you
taking care of the house,

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.480 align:middle line:84%
changing things in that house,
moving things in the house,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.784 align:middle line:90%
and throwing away stuff.

00:34:58.784 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
she is telling me

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.219 align:middle line:84%
that you've been trying to throw
away stuff for a long time.

00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.198 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you would also have

00:35:06.198 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:90%
certain books or piles of books.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know the books
are in the boxes.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand about that?

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.346 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wouldn't you
also have some of her books

00:35:13.346 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:90%
that she had as well?

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
we love magazines.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.775 align:middle line:84%
So I know you have
these old magazines.

00:35:18.775 --> 00:35:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now your
dad is here as well.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:84%
When your father
comes through to me,

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.740 align:middle line:84%
and he's coming through--
now, we wouldn't necessarily

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:84%
believe in this sort of thing,
but I've got to tell you,

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
he's standing right here.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, great.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and you were
very close to your grandfather.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.266 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So he's
coming over here to you,

00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and he's giving you
the light in his eye,

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.299 align:middle line:90%
just expressing that to you.

00:35:34.299 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:35.798 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:35:35.798 --> 00:35:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And all the kids.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.027 align:middle line:84%
He said, all the kids, not
just you, but all the kids, OK?

00:35:39.027 --> 00:35:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also want to talk
about-- they're giving me

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.590 align:middle line:84%
an impression of painting
the side of the house,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.402 align:middle line:90%
painting the house.

00:35:44.402 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Did your father used
to paint the houses?

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Or was somebody was painting
the side of the house?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Understand that.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.365 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what he's
showing me right here.

00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:51.487 align:middle line:90%
And I'm on the ladder.

00:35:51.487 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm changing the color, and
I'm very specific and detailed

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:90%
about how I have to do this.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing siding on
a part the house as well.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:57.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.195 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know there would

00:35:59.195 --> 00:36:00.750 align:middle line:84%
be a connection
toward the Midwest

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.177 align:middle line:84%
or would have that
connection of growing up.

00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:04.010 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely, right?

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
him and the mother

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
come in very, very
strong together.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And their union, they're
bonded, they're very connected.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:11.615 align:middle line:90%
I've got to say that.

00:36:11.615 --> 00:36:13.406 align:middle line:84%
So I know if one passes
over, the other one

00:36:13.406 --> 00:36:15.080 align:middle line:84%
has to pass over
close by, because I

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.632 align:middle line:90%
feel like they're like one.

00:36:16.632 --> 00:36:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.757 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

00:36:18.757 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They're one.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.210 align:middle line:84%
They're one unit, and I'm very
emotional with these people.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
many people could

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:90%
learn from their relationship.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Because whether hard
times or good times,

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:90%
they stuck together.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very much.

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that your father at times

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.000 align:middle line:84%
could not work, he's
telling me here,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that at times he couldn't find
work or there wasn't work.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.875 align:middle line:84%
And he had to always make
the best that he could.

00:36:38.875 --> 00:36:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.568 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
also know he's very

00:36:41.568 --> 00:36:43.050 align:middle line:84%
much of a handyman
in his own way.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I know very much he would like
to work with wood and tools

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and making things if he could.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that there could have
been a time where he was trying

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.970 align:middle line:84%
to fix something, he's talking
about, and he hurt himself.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, one of his fingers
got hurt, but he hurt himself.

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you remembered that?

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That is what
he's trying to tell me.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:90%
He cut his fingers off.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
you understand that?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He cut a finger off.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's it.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:84%
He's also mentioning
to me that-- how funny.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:84%
He said he tried to be
better than he really was.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.250 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't that
great a repairman,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.114 align:middle line:10%
but he tried to let
everyone think he was.

00:37:10.114 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:10%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:10%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And I know there was a--

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.894 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my gosh.

00:37:13.894 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember that?

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I also-- I'm
very aware of going,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.600 align:middle line:84%
mom wants me to talk to
you about the church.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking
about church here.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.312 align:middle line:84%
So church is a big
deal for your mother.

00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.301 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Definitely.

00:37:26.301 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I know with this
lady that church is her life.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:31.806 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I like putting
the flowers on the altar.

00:37:31.806 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Loved it.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loved it.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.233 align:middle line:84%
She's telling me that's
what she used to do.

00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:90%
We're together.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Her and your dad are together.

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.534 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to help
you clean things up.

00:37:39.534 --> 00:37:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You're so funny,
because-- and would you

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:84%
please help your mother
out a little bit?

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Because she needs a
little bit of help.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And she gets very independent,
I'll do it myself!

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
yet, you know, she's

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.950 align:middle line:90%
trying to help you, so please.

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.304 align:middle line:90%
Listen to him.

00:37:52.304 --> 00:37:53.097 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:53.097 --> 00:37:54.096 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's them.

00:37:54.096 --> 00:37:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Listen to them.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know the
overalls with your father--

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.050 align:middle line:84%
every once in a while
he'd wear overalls.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:37:59.905 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:37:59.905 --> 00:38:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Remember the overalls?

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He'd come
in wearing overalls.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And he'd wear the bib
overalls, and that's

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.306 align:middle line:90%
how he would appear to you.

00:38:05.306 --> 00:38:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was taking
care of things.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I also know mom is here,
your mother is here.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you have dishes,
the dishes that belong to her,

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:12.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.846 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking
about her dishes.

00:38:13.846 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And that recently
came up in your world.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.580 align:middle line:90%
And I know the have-- right.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.456 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a religious
necklace of hers.

00:38:20.456 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's the Virgin
Mary or a cross, but you have--

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A cross.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A cross.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And you have it
of hers, she said.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I love to be in the flowers.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:27.655 align:middle line:90%
Your mother is in the flowers.

00:38:27.655 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
loving tulips.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.495 align:middle line:84%
She said the tulips
are coming up.

00:38:30.495 --> 00:38:31.370 align:middle line:90%
She loves the tulips.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.840 align:middle line:90%
Tulips are a dream.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my gosh.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Not
the rose, the tulips.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Not roses, tulips.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, tulips.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she's
saying that you'll

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:90%
know it's me with the tulips.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:90%
So you have her love.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.091 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:38:39.091 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my gosh.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And your dad, OK?

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.015 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:42.015 --> 00:38:42.515 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:42.515 --> 00:38:45.685 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:45.685 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Would somebody know

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
about a young man that passed
over in a car accident?

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.800 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Would that be a friend of your
son's or a friend of somebody

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in the family, or--

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My cousin was--

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your cousin.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: --killed in a--

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 22 years of age?

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:90%
21 years of age?

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:00.194 align:middle line:84%
May I please come
to you, please?

00:39:00.194 --> 00:39:01.316 align:middle line:90%
Because I have him.

00:39:01.316 --> 00:39:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
mind standing, please?

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me just tell
you what I get here.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I get this gentleman
coming in here.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.307 align:middle line:84%
And I feel when he passes,
it totally is a surprise.

00:39:09.307 --> 00:39:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It's something to do
with a car, a collision

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.235 align:middle line:90%
of some kind, an accident.

00:39:12.235 --> 00:39:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
the front of the car

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.588 align:middle line:90%
would be involved here.

00:39:14.588 --> 00:39:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So I know the
dashboard is something

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that would be also
involved here.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
aware of that?

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And I understand-- do you
have a sister, by the way?

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.420 align:middle line:90%
You have a sister.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.736 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so
this boy is talking to me

00:39:24.736 --> 00:39:26.020 align:middle line:90%
about a sister of yours.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
appeared to your sister

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
or been in her dreams
or something recently

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.222 align:middle line:90%
came up about her.

00:39:31.222 --> 00:39:32.180 align:middle line:90%
And you say, well, why?

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't
really know her.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:34.300 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have a connection.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
connection in some way.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.604 align:middle line:90%
Do you know his mother?

00:39:37.604 --> 00:39:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
please ask the mother

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.900 align:middle line:90%
if she just got a dog?

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.424 align:middle line:90%
And he's telling me she did.

00:39:42.424 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:90%
So I'm telling--

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know that?

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, so
the mother got a dog?

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's him telling me
that his mother got a dog.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.390 align:middle line:90%
That's where it makes sense.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And I know that mom--
go on, go on, go on.

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.670 align:middle line:90%
You keep on coming in.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I understand that, thank you.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:90%
He's a good kid.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:55.580 align:middle line:90%
He's good.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.280 align:middle line:90%
He's quick.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I think he was doing something
with school at the time.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.339 align:middle line:84%
It might be right after
graduation or school.

00:40:01.339 --> 00:40:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Because school was on his mind,
he said, when he was passing.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.182 align:middle line:84%
That was the time when
he died, that there

00:40:05.182 --> 00:40:06.540 align:middle line:84%
was something to
do with school, OK?

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.159 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, I know
that he's coming here today,

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:84%
because I need to please
tell my mother I'm all right.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.179 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:40:13.179 --> 00:40:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, my God.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:84%
This poor boy is working
overtime to help his mother.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.297 align:middle line:84%
Because she still feels very
guilty about this death.

00:40:19.297 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason
she feels that she

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:90%
could have prevented this death.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.204 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't have.

00:40:23.204 --> 00:40:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to tell you that.

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.865 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Go on, go on.

00:40:27.865 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:28.879 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:28.879 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And would you please
find out if she's

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.640 align:middle line:84%
been writing letters
to him just recently?

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.650 align:middle line:84%
If she's still been
writing a letter to him.

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:90%
And does he have a sister?

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:37.576 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:37.576 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:39.110 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:40.320 align:middle line:90%
So I understand now.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm clearing up
the message here.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I would know that
the sister would

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:90%
have received a message from me.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.407 align:middle line:84%
So his sister would
have received a dream,

00:40:48.407 --> 00:40:50.990 align:middle line:84%
would have received a message,
because he's been really trying

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.616 align:middle line:84%
to come through to his sister to
tell the mother he's all right.

00:40:54.616 --> 00:40:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
the information.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.284 align:middle line:84%
So would you please do that
and pass the message on?

00:40:58.284 --> 00:40:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I mean,
he's come all this way.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Please pass it on.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:02.640 align:middle line:90%
You can be the medium.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.993 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
he's thanking me

00:41:03.993 --> 00:41:05.772 align:middle line:84%
and he's thanking
you very, very much.

00:41:05.772 --> 00:41:06.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'll leave you with that.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Great,
thank you so much.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, God bless you.

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:09.108 align:middle line:90%
OK, you're welcome.

00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:13.410 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:90%
So I want to ask somebody here.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a gentleman
that's coming in here.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there would have
been someone in this audience.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.660 align:middle line:84%
He was talking to me
about having a pocket

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:27.230 align:middle line:84%
watch of theirs, only a pocket
watch or given a pocket watch.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you, sir?

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, you may.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what is your name?

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Timothy Gallagher.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Timothy Gallagher.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Timothy Gallagher,
would you mind

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.510 align:middle line:90%
standing, Timothy Gallagher?

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.761 align:middle line:84%
OK, I believe I have
your dad with me here.

00:41:35.761 --> 00:41:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I felt the presence of a
gentleman standing here

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm aware that there might
be a younger person that's also

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.820 align:middle line:84%
passed over, not your father's
age, but younger, a younger

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.364 align:middle line:84%
generation, more like on your
generation, but it would be--

00:41:48.364 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it
would be a relative.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if it
would be your brother.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:90%
But it's someone like--

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother-in-law.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.498 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Brother-in-law.

00:41:54.498 --> 00:41:56.816 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I brought
him here with me today.

00:41:56.816 --> 00:41:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
this is important

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.398 align:middle line:84%
that this brother-in-law
person comes through to you.

00:42:00.398 --> 00:42:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And can I just say
to you, Timothy,

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.075 align:middle line:84%
that I'm very
connected with him.

00:42:04.075 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You were very
connected with him.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Somewhat, yes.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.953 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
feel I want to thank you

00:42:08.953 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:84%
for, whether you hung
out together sometimes

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.650 align:middle line:84%
or did some things
together sometimes,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.436 align:middle line:84%
I just want to thank
you for that, OK?

00:42:14.436 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I also know
there's a Margaret somewhere.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know who
Margaret would be.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Is there a Margaret that you
would recognize in the spirit

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.760 align:middle line:84%
world named Margaret
or down here Margaret.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had
an Aunt Margaret.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
had an Aunt Margaret.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go
back to that stop

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.905 align:middle line:84%
watch or that clock,
the pocket watch, OK?

00:42:26.905 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I don't
know why, but I'm going there.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Now do you remember your dad
ever giving you a pocket watch

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.842 align:middle line:84%
or giving you a
watch of some kind?

00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My father
had a pocket watch,

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and I got it when
he passed away.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you still
own that pocket watch, do you?

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm looking
at it very, very clearly.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And the small hand is on the
3, and there's like another,

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.019 align:middle line:84%
like 10 to 3 or quarter
of 3, the large hand.

00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:48.810 align:middle line:90%
So would you check?

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had with so you
could see it right now.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what he's
impressing me with, OK?

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that, OK?

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:57.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I know it was over
here, but I had bundt cake.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So you understand the bundt
cake, just made a bundt cake.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:42:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing up, please?

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And your name is?

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EMCEE: David.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, David.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:03.025 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:43:03.025 --> 00:43:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm good.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And what
is your birth sign?

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Gemini.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Gemini.

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're all over the
place, like we talked about.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:09.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:11.968 align:middle line:84%
So immediately I want to tell
you there's a man behind you,

00:43:11.968 --> 00:43:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and I feel it's a
grandfather person here.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Your mom's still alive, correct?

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's down here.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.662 align:middle line:84%
So I think this
might be her dad, OK?

00:43:17.662 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it is.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
would know that there

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:22.385 align:middle line:84%
would be a closeness with you
or a connection with this man.

00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And now
when you're a little boy,

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.800 align:middle line:84%
because I'm being shown a young
age, whether it's toddler up

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.790 align:middle line:84%
to 10 years of age, I'm very
connected with this gentleman.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to ask, who
collects the cars or likes

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.260 align:middle line:90%
things about cars?

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Is that you?

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So my dad collected
cars, and then my grandfather--

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
dad's passed over?

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, he's not.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But my grandfather
restored an old T-bird.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There it is.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.708 align:middle line:84%
Because before when
I was looking at you,

00:43:42.708 --> 00:43:43.902 align:middle line:90%
I saw an old classic car.

00:43:43.902 --> 00:43:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.901 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, so the
grandfather that I have here,

00:43:46.901 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and he's talking about the cars,
wouldn't you have known when

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:84%
you were a young boy, looking
with your grandfather with

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.580 align:middle line:90%
the cars, the old cars--

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.413 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah

00:43:54.413 --> 00:43:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
he go open up the hood

00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and show you the engine,
and he used to tell you

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:84%
these things about the
car, isn't that right?

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, uh-huh.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because I like that.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And I like you cleaning
the car with him.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I like him sharing
things with you.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:07.279 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
that your grandfather didn't

00:44:07.279 --> 00:44:09.970 align:middle line:84%
come necessarily
from wealthy means.

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
He didn't grow up
with a lot of money.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.080 align:middle line:84%
He grew up, and he really
made his own self, OK?

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And I know he really worked
hard to make himself,

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.690 align:middle line:90%
and he's very proud of that.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:19.689 align:middle line:90%
He's very proud of that.

00:44:19.689 --> 00:44:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I know there's five
children somewhere.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.610 align:middle line:90%
There's five in a family.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad's-- sorry,
my other grandfather had

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:84%
a previous family that
had five children.

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Five children.

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And so he's on the
other side as well.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:32.700 align:middle line:90%
And he's talking about the five.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.866 align:middle line:90%
So I have both of them here.

00:44:33.866 --> 00:44:35.120 align:middle line:90%
And I have two ladies here.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I have
the whole choir

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.630 align:middle line:90%
here of people who come in.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:40.130 align:middle line:90%
And they help you.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said your biggest
situation is to really make up

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.699 align:middle line:84%
your mind in what you
really want to stay and do.

00:44:46.699 --> 00:44:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you could have
been a teacher at one point.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:84%
You could have liked
to have taught.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I teach now, yeah.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that they
talk about helping you.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:84%
All of these spirit
people influence you

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.090 align:middle line:84%
and help you to
work the teaching.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you must
understand as a teacher,

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that when you're
giving out that energy,

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.570 align:middle line:84%
you're not doing it
yourself, that they're

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:05.520 align:middle line:90%
helping to influence.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.990 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to bring out
stuff, abilities and gifts

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.474 align:middle line:84%
within your spirit that you
bring forth to everybody you

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.890 align:middle line:84%
touch, everybody that you work
with, everybody that you're

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:13.980 align:middle line:90%
speaking in front of.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not only you, it's a
collaborative effort, OK?

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And I need to say
thank you to you.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:20.981 align:middle line:84%
Because this gentleman,
your grandfather-- there's

00:45:20.981 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:84%
also a grandmother
over there, by the way.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell
you, you've helped them

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:84%
by how you live on
this Earth and how

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.669 align:middle line:84%
you've tried really hard to help
people that are not well off.

00:45:29.669 --> 00:45:32.085 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if you worked
with some kind of a mission

00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:34.510 align:middle line:84%
also or food giveaway
at one point,

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.140 align:middle line:90%
but there's this sort of thing.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In high
school I did some stuff.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In high school.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that that was very meaningful,

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.380 align:middle line:84%
not only for you here,
but those who received it.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And we never know how each
action, which we create,

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:48.250 align:middle line:90%
will influence somebody else.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're thanking
you for that.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.040 align:middle line:90%
One more thing here.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's some old
library books that you have

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and that you have them and that
you've never returned them.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm-- your grandfather's
laughing about this.

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
I know if I go to where you
are, where you find yourself

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.307 align:middle line:84%
at a home or an apartment
or living situation,

00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:09.640 align:middle line:84%
there would be an office there
with a computer, correct?

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: At my house?

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.252 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wouldn't
there be shelves next to you

00:46:13.252 --> 00:46:13.932 align:middle line:90%
where books are?

00:46:13.932 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.280 align:middle line:90%
There are some.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.196 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So if I
go there, wouldn't there

00:46:17.196 --> 00:46:19.250 align:middle line:90%
be three shelves of books?

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:20.891 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
actually there are.

00:46:20.891 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because they're
showing this in my mind's eye.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing that if you
go to that second shelf,

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and next to books that are
about home repair stuff,

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll find there
are two books that

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.645 align:middle line:84%
are from a library
from years ago--

00:46:31.645 --> 00:46:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --that
you still have.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's not judging you.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just acknowledging it
and validating for you, OK?

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.215 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:38.215 --> 00:46:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
there'd be a home repair

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.440 align:middle line:84%
section or something, and it
would be right near there.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I have cookbooks, actually.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.146 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cookbooks, OK.

00:46:45.146 --> 00:46:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so-- oh, yeah, you
just said the bundt cake.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
the bundt cake.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.275 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And don't you
love to do casseroles as well?

00:46:50.275 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I like to cook.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.670 align:middle line:90%
I really like to cook, yeah.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
like that feeling.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I like more of that
happening for you.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.396 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And just
realize you don't do it alone.

00:46:56.396 --> 00:46:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
comes out pretty good, so.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Comes
out pretty good.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you're being inspired.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Inspired chef.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:04.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.988 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:47:05.988 --> 00:47:09.876 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:09.876 --> 00:47:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so it's
important now today-- hopefully

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.190 align:middle line:84%
you've learn this, and
we've talked about it,

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that you understand sun signs,
the star signs, whatever

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.720 align:middle line:90%
you call it.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.630 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And you've come back
with a certain sun sign

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to be who you are and
learn everything you can

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:84%
about those energies,
positive or the negative.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And the more you are aware
of those various energies

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.546 align:middle line:84%
of the star signs, of
horoscopes, if you will,

00:47:31.546 --> 00:47:33.920 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll be able to
understand another human being

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.632 align:middle line:84%
and what their motivation
is and how they choose life.

00:47:36.632 --> 00:47:38.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a better
understanding,

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and in turn, more
compassion for that person.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's all why we're here.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all very
much for coming today.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sir.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, ma'am.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for bringing him.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:48.703 align:middle line:90%
I know it was tough.

00:47:48.703 --> 00:47:49.610 align:middle line:90%
But you made it.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:50.322 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.322 --> 00:47:51.410 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And your mother wants to thank
you for the sewing machine.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.610 align:middle line:84%
You must have the
sewing machine,

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.070 align:middle line:84%
because she's talking about
you have her sewing machine

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that she wanted to
say that to you.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.870 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to say that to you.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:58.791 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:47:58.791 --> 00:47:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:47:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.746 align:middle line:84%
He's freaking out, so
with that, we'll close.

00:48:01.746 --> 00:48:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everybody.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:03.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.170 align:middle line:90%
