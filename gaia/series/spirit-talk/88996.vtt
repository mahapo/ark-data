>>ANNOUNCER: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.162 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi everyone.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Hi everyone.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.235 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And thank you at home
also for watching,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
where I take you one
step closer to heaven.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully today we'll
see what happens

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
as we connect to
the spirit world.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to talk
about something which I just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:90%
wrote a book about.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:90%
And my book is right here.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Adventures
of the Soul."

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote this
book because I found

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine named Debbie
Ford, who is a life coach,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and talked about
spiritual matters.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:90%
She passed away two years ago.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And I helped her pass.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember very distinctly
that Debbie didn't really

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
know how to pass.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
She was kind of stuck
in between the material

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
world with her thoughts, and
she couldn't release her soul.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me to come
to her in meditation.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
I helped her in a meditation.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, Debbie,
why won't you pass over?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said in my
thoughts and my meditation,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I had a kid, James.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.558 align:middle line:90%
I have an eight-year-old kid.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do?

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.857 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Debbie, it's OK.

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Your mother is here.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
You have family members
to take care of the child.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:90%
It'll be OK.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.516 align:middle line:90%
Just ease into it.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
There are those
on the other side

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of the light-- in
the veil, if you

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.054 align:middle line:90%
will-- reaching to get to you.

00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to tell
her who the people were

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
the veil waiting for her

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and waiting to receive her--
because every single one of us

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:90%
is met by somebody.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:90%
No one ever dies alone, ever.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So I went through this
thing with Debbie.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, gee, James, it's
as if I've been given keys

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.735 align:middle line:84%
to a car and I don't
know how to drive.

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, that's
really, really interesting

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:90%
she would say that.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And then she went on to
say, I spent my whole life

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.252 align:middle line:90%
learning how to live.

00:02:10.252 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And now I have to
learn how to die.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.615 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So don't you think that's
really interesting?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
That someone who worked in
this field for so, so long

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
would have that
awareness-- or not

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
awareness-- I should say that
perspective that she was just

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.087 align:middle line:84%
connected with
that physical body.

00:02:26.087 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I assisted Debbie in telling
her listen, you are a soul.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And a soul has been
here many, many times.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
A soul has been here through
eons and eons of lifetimes.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:90%
And we come in and we go.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And I really do believe that
our souls come upon this earth

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to learn many lessons.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:84%
This is our
schoolroom down here.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
This is where a soul comes
back to learn spiritual lessons

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
in order for it to expand and
to grow and to really evolve,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.499 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Evolve in your soul being-ness.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt I had to write
that book because, if Debbie

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:84%
was somebody who
worked in the field--

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.425 align:middle line:84%
she was a light worker-- and she
didn't really know how to pass

00:03:04.425 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
on and what it was all
about, what death was about,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, what about
the average person who didn't

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
really know about the
soul, how to pass,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
how to die correctly,
and so forth?

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.422 align:middle line:84%
The right ways of going about
things, what to expect next.

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote that book,
"Adventures of the Soul."

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So today I'd like to share
with you bits of that book

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and really talk about
the soul and the lessons

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that the soul comes
back to learn, OK?

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
As souls, before we come
back onto this earth school,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:84%
we tend to meet with our
counselors, our guides,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
our angels, our
teachers, whatever

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
label you'd like to put that in.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And the in-between worlds
between the heaven world,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
if you want to talk to
that, or the earth world,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
the in-between
world is where you

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
will meet these
teachers and guides.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
active vibration.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a very active world.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
You go to school
there to learn things,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to expand your
knowledge of things,

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for your next
incarnation, if you will.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
You also will meet
your loved ones.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.377 align:middle line:84%
And you will connect
with them, and finish

00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
certain relationships
that you had with them

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that you might have
started down here.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that we should
look at things very differently.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
When we talk to our
guides our and teachers,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
we prepare for our
next incarnation.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.006 align:middle line:84%
So as we study with
our loved ones,

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
we study with our teachers
and our guides and our angels,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
we do set up a
blueprint for our soul.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.989 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to set
up a blueprint,

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
but not only for our soul, but
for our soul group or our soul

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:90%
family.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
You've all heard of
soul mates, right?

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:90%
A sould mate.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
People think you
have one soul mate.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:90%
James, who is my soul mate?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And I try to tell the person
it's not one soul mate;

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:90%
it's soul mates.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
It's those souls who you have
experienced many lifetimes

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
with, many experiences
with, that you

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.070 align:middle line:90%
have a kind of affinity toward.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
You could think of it this way--
that a soul mate is somebody

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
who you've been to
through many classes with.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
You studied many of
the same subjects.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.266 align:middle line:84%
You've been around
the same times,

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:90%
you know the same people.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You've had a lot of
the same experiences.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.155 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when
you meet somebody,

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:59.106 align:middle line:84%
and you have a certain
affinity with them--

00:04:59.106 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So, it's somebody you have
that affinity with that you've

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.274 align:middle line:90%
learned with.

00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you this also.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
That when we come
back as a soul, we do

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
tend to come back not
only with our soul mates,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
but we tend to come
back at the most

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
opportune time for
our soul's growth.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So we also tend to go back in
soul families or soul groups.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So in one lifetime, you
could have been the father.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Another time, the mother.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
The child.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:90%
The grandparent.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And you might have passed over
when you were 30 years of age.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:90%
You might have left as a child.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
You might have died of old age.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that, and maybe the
analogy is a pretty good one,

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
where we could look at the
world, this earth, as a stage,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:90%
like Shakespeare said.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:90%
A stage.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And we do take on
different roles.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We take on different roles as a
mother, the father, the child,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the friend in order to
optimize our souls' growth

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and in order to have a
scenario present that we really

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
can grow from each other as
well-- not only ourselves,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
but grow with each other
by sharing that scenario.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And kind of going within to our
natural intuition, the soul's

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.870 align:middle line:84%
The soul's language
is intuition,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:90%
meaning into the soul.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And all different scenarios
and choices you make in life

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
really are easier if you
use your soul's language

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:90%
of intuition.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.219 align:middle line:84%
You'll get through your
lessons so much easier.

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting to know
that we're not just growing

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
by ourselves, our
own soul's growth,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
but you-- we also are
growing with a soul family.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So what affects you also affects
everybody else in your soul

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
family or your soul group.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:90%
And you kind of know that.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.867 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
we're all connected.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I do believe that we're all one.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
That there's a big illusion,
this three-dimensional world,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that we're separate
from one another,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%
when in reality we are one.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:90%
We are one energy.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And we pass out of
this physical school.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
We go graduate.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Our souls graduate to
our real place of origin.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
We begin to have the
awareness right away, wow,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:90%
we're all connected.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.404 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:06:57.404 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I did in
my life affected

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that person, and that
person, and that person,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:90%
and that person.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.595 align:middle line:84%
And since we're all
connected, I really

00:07:04.595 --> 00:07:06.725 align:middle line:84%
am responsible for how
another person felt.

00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Just so you know that.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.166 align:middle line:84%
It's very important you know
that because, immediately, it

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
can set up a sense
of mindfulness.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
A sense of
responsibility with what

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.295 align:middle line:84%
you think about another person,
what you say to another person.

00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:21.134 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense so far?

00:07:21.134 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're quick.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:90%
You got it at home?

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So we tend to come
back in soul groups.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:90%
So lesson, just repeat this.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Soul families.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We will all pick the optimum
time for all of our growth,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.529 align:middle line:84%
not only individual,
but together.

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you can come
back to the third generation

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:90%
of that same family.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
You tend to come back
to the same family

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:90%
line, the same heredity line.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.882 align:middle line:84%
And you evolve
that line as well.

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The quickest way
a soul can grow is

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
through using the
energy of love.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Love is this natural energy.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Love is the soul's
natural energy.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.021 align:middle line:84%
And in order for you to grow
on this earth, this schoolroom,

00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be easy for you
to grow if you have people

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
in your life who were always
so nice to you, and happy,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and sweet, and did
everything you want,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.915 align:middle line:90%
and everything was OK.

00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no growth.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:90%
There'd be no conflict.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So you wouldn't be forced
to look at something very

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.708 align:middle line:90%
differently, would you?

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So the biggest teachers,
the best teachers

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest teachers that we
have in this schoolroom, earth,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who
treat us the worst.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:90%
You're crazy.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's very-- when
you think about it,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and we think of the concept
that we are all one,

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
and there's a connection
of oneness with all of us.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody hurts me,
and I stay in judgment,

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing?

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm not helping them.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.291 align:middle line:84%
If I can't forgive them,
I can't forgive myself.

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
They are teaching me a lesson.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:90%
What lesson?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they're teaching
me a lesson of patience.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm impatient.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I think, oh, go to heck.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.564 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.564 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh, to heck with
you or something.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
What is it that that
person's showing you,

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.974 align:middle line:84%
that they're bringing to
the surface to show you?

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
That's something about
yourself that's not forgiven.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.089 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Something about yourself that
has not been brought back

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
into wholeness-- because
if we're all are all one,

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
there's something being
present to show you that's

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:90%
not being brought into balance.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So really, those people in your
life that are the hardest ones

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
to get along with, the
adversarial ones, they

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
are your greatest teachers.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you can forgive
them, you forgive yourself.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
You forgive yourself,
you forgive them.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected to it.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.977 align:middle line:84%
I always say treat
another person

00:09:28.977 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:90%
as you would want to be treated.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Use the golden rule.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Best way to live.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.109 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.109 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Any questions before
we move on about souls

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.858 align:middle line:90%
or what I talked about?

00:09:35.858 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
stand up, please?

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.138 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:09:39.138 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking
about soul families,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.309 align:middle line:84%
does this-- so you're talking
about hereditary stuff, too.

00:09:46.309 --> 00:09:48.225 align:middle line:84%
Does it go along with
maybe your significant--

00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:90%
your life partner or partners.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Of course.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So would you
congregate with a life partner

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Of course.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So it's not
just a bloodline thing?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's not
just a bloodline thing.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a thing-- who's in
your soul atmosphere, who's

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.080 align:middle line:84%
connected with you
in this lifetime that

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
is significant to you.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So in another
lifetime, and you could

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
have been the mother
to that person.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.257 align:middle line:90%
We play different roles.

00:10:07.257 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Of those people in
our lives right now

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.670 align:middle line:84%
who are the most
intimate with us,

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.702 align:middle line:84%
whether family,
friends, partners,

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
we have shared
different roles with

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and learn different things from.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And we also go into
what's called karma.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You know karma, the law
of cause and effect.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The natural law of
cause and effect.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:90%
What you give out, you get back.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And really we have to understand
that every single person

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
creates with their
thoughts and creates

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
with their mind, what they
say to people, the words.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And you have to live out
what you've sent out.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So in another
lifetime, you might

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:90%
have said something to somebody.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And now in this
lifetime, you have

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
to live what you sent out
in the previous lifetime.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Like
being accountable

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:90%
for your-- everything.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You got to be
accountable for everything.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You have to be accountable
for everything.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.404 align:middle line:84%
And just that alone can
help you to live good life--

00:10:49.404 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
because if you
realize that you're

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
responsible for every
thought, word, and deed,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and then when you pass
to the side of life,

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.644 align:middle line:84%
you got to look
back at your life

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and see all the good, the
bad, and the indifferent,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to force you
to say, wait a minute.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.975 align:middle line:84%
From now on, as James
Van Praagh told me this,

00:11:02.975 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start being mindful
about my words and my thoughts

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.321 align:middle line:90%
because they'll come back to me.

00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thanks

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
I thought we would do

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
is a little-- a quick little
mind journey with you.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.424 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:90%
A quick little mind journey.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
do is there is a way

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to find out what soul lessons
that are the most prevalent

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.270 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.715 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
help you with that.

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:24.294 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:11:24.294 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yay.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.569 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you
to do is I'm just

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
going to have you
just close your eyes.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
If you never meditated
before, that's fine.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to
listen to my voice.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And we might have some
music behind my voice.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Now look at that.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.256 align:middle line:90%
Magic.

00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:41.505 align:middle line:84%
And those people at home,
just relax, close your eyes.

00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:44.895 align:middle line:84%
And you, too, can just listen
to my voice and the music.

00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:46.073 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:48.156 align:middle line:84%
And just bring your mind
to a place of neutrality.

00:11:48.156 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.656 align:middle line:84%
Bring your mind to a
place of just being.

00:11:52.656 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:90%
Just being.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We all have thoughts, but
we just see them as thoughts

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and not give them any
more emotion or judgment.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful that things
might pop into your head

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:84%
while you're sitting
here, and that's fine.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Just don't give any power.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:90%
We're just going to observe.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.754 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Just going to observe.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So now, as we hear
the sound of my voice,

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to
be mindful of how

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.595 align:middle line:84%
your body feels
sitting in the chairs.

00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of your
feet on the floor.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of your legs and
your backs, your shoulders,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
your arms, your
hands, your head.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful, please, and bring
your attention to your heart.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.050 align:middle line:84%
The heart, the center
of your being-ness.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.645 align:middle line:84%
The heart is where
the soul resides.

00:12:43.645 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.016 align:middle line:84%
And that beautiful
soul, you can imagine

00:12:49.016 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:84%
it is sparkling
green, sparkling gold.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.042 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
It is like a
kaleidoscope of color

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that brings every aspect
of the core of your being,

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
every essence of who
you've always been

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
and who you will be,
all your belief systems,

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
all your sense of selves,
all your connection to others

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.925 align:middle line:90%
sits in the soul.

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
All the experiences that
you've had in past lives

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:90%
and in current lives.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
All the lessons you've
learned and have not learned.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
All those lessons that
you come back to repeat,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to understand, to expand
your awareness of,

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:31.192 align:middle line:84%
and to live accordingly
are tucked into the soul.

00:13:31.192 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you
right now to imagine

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
as you inhale a beautiful
breath into the nose,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to open up that
heart center of the soul

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:90%
and make it very, very bright.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale
out of your mouth,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
you're going to release any
old, stagnant energy that

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
no longer serves
your highest good.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So together let's open up
that beautiful soul center.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So bring in that
beautiful golden light.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.955 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.955 --> 00:14:10.552 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:14:10.552 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.817 align:middle line:84%
All the old stuff,
just let it go,

00:14:15.817 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
bringing yourself back to
the center of your soul.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.705 align:middle line:84%
And again, and inhale
a beautiful sense

00:14:23.705 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of divine light enriching you,
illuminating you, expanding

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Holding it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.045 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:90%
Out of your mouth.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.248 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear you.

00:14:39.248 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:90%
And just one more time.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.890 align:middle line:90%
And feel that.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Be with that space, holding
it, two, three, four,

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:90%
and exhale all the old.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Blow it out.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%
All that old, stagnant
energy falls from you,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.566 align:middle line:84%
goes down to Mother Earth so
she can recycle it to love.

00:15:04.566 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit in
this beautiful space

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
with your soul connection
to Mother Earth

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and also to the divine
light, become mindful

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.370 align:middle line:90%
of that heart space.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you hear
my voice, I would

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
like you to go back
in time in your mind.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.575 align:middle line:84%
Go back to your childhood
to a very happy memory.

00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
We all might have had
some negative experiences.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:90%
We are aware of that.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But we just want to go right
now to a happy time as a child,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
Christmas day, holidays,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:90%
a birthday, riding your bikes.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Something that made you
feel real, real good;

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
real, real, happy.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.845 align:middle line:90%
And as you do that, be mindful.

00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of who's in
the picture with you,

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:84%
what scenario is happening, and
how do you feel emotionally.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:90%
What's going on.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.756 align:middle line:90%
See it.

00:16:07.756 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of it.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Be there.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And now bring yourself and your
mind five years to the future,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
from that experience to
another moment in your life.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And I just want you to observe.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
emotionally get involved

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
in it, just like you're
observing a movie,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:90%
a television show.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Just see your life and
see, most importantly,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
how you respond to people
that are close to you.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
How do you respond to
family members, to friends.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And just in your mind, bring
yourself to a situation

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
where you have to interact
with these friends and family

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.060 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:90%
See what that's like.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:90%
How do you react?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.380 align:middle line:90%
How do they make you feel?

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Just observing.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Not being caught up emotionally.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Just observing.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Just like doing a study.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And now bring your soul five
years more in advancement,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:14.537 align:middle line:84%
five years ahead to another
important moment in your life

00:17:14.537 --> 00:17:15.620 align:middle line:90%
where you had to interact.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you had to make
a decision or choice that

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
changed your life,
and that's fine.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
Once again, how did
your soul react?

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
What lessons do you think
your soul was learning?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:90%
What presented itself to you?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:90%
How did you receive it?

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Observing it.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.320 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Now bring yourself up five
years more in the future,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
five years more to an
important moment in your life.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was a
choice you made,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
a career move, a
relationship, whatever

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
it is for you where your
soul was expressing itself.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Just become aware of
how you responded,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
what situations you were in,
what was drawn to your soul.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
What scenarios, what
experiences did your soul

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
draw to it in order
to understand,

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.315 align:middle line:84%
to see things a little
bit differently.

00:18:24.315 --> 00:18:26.237 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.237 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps change your perspective.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And now take a deep breath
with that one, and exhale.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And bring yourself
to present day.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself to present day,
to your life in present day.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.795 align:middle line:84%
And just see, observing, not
emotionally getting involved.

00:18:45.795 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Just look around your
life and see the people

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
that are involved, see the
scenarios that are happening.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you look around, be
mindful of how you respond

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.626 align:middle line:84%
to other people's thoughts,
to other people's actions.

00:19:02.626 --> 00:19:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:90%
How do you respond?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.635 align:middle line:90%
How does your soul respond?

00:19:06.635 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.581 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.170 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at that,
I would like for you

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
in your mind to go from the
childhood to present day.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful of
the reoccurring lessons

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:90%
that play over and over again.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:84%
There may be a pattern that
you notice, which is just fine.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Just be mindful of the
pattern of your soul,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the various same lessons
of the soul you're still

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:90%
trying to learn.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The ones that step
forward, that seem

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.172 align:middle line:84%
to dominate your life
experience so far.

00:19:50.172 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:58.742 align:middle line:84%
And as you see them, also
become aware what could you

00:19:58.742 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:84%
do to learn the fullness of
that life experience now.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:84%
What can you do to learn
the fullness of that life

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:90%
experience now?

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.157 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.157 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you demonstrate forgiveness?

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.351 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps patience?

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love?

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude?

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.242 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.242 --> 00:20:22.825 align:middle line:90%
Understanding?

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.635 align:middle line:90%
What can you give?

00:20:26.635 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:90%
More observant?

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it might
be, just see it.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of what you can apply
to that scenario in your life

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to assist you in learning
the fullness of that lesson.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep
breath, and exhale.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.537 align:middle line:84%
And slowly come
back to your body.

00:20:48.537 --> 00:20:49.495 align:middle line:90%
Your feet on the floor.

00:20:49.495 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.856 align:middle line:84%
Your legs, your bodies,
your backs in the chair,

00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
your shoulders, your legs,
your head, your eyes.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Slowly open up your eyes.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Raise up your arms and
wiggle your fingers.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Back in the body, very good.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Open your eyes.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Look at the smiles.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Great, much brighter.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Yours are much brighter.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to just share maybe
a little bit of some insights

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
that you had that you
didn't expect to have.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyone want to
share what lessons

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
they found that
they came to learn

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.700 align:middle line:84%
or they're presently learning
that repeated themselves.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
during that meditation,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.210 align:middle line:84%
I was reliving a
lot of frustration.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
People that were very
controlling in my life.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion
that I had dealing

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:90%
with that for most of my life.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And the word that came to mind
at the end was understanding.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.704 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.704 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.955 align:middle line:84%
So you repeated controlling
people in your life.

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:01.622 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:01.622 --> 00:22:03.163 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
could it be perhaps

00:22:03.163 --> 00:22:05.620 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted them to
understand who you really were

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.436 align:middle line:84%
or to listen to your words,
that your words had value?

00:22:08.436 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that
what it might be?

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: To stand
up for yourself perhaps?

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, definitely.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Definitely that.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
your soul's lessons

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.136 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I was a doormat.

00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I was a doormat.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A lot
of us are, yeah.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's an important one.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.839 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: So I understood--

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What do you have
to do to make that better now?

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.482 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I
have made it better.

00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You said
understand, so you have.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.106 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So I understand
why they treated me

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
the way that they did because of
the way that I treated myself.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Love that.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.542 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they have no
other way to look at you.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
If you don't treat
yourself-- You're

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:90%
telling them how to treat you.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So I-- The understanding I think
is coming-- my understanding

00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of why they were the way they
were, why I was the way I was.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.887 align:middle line:90%
And it's very freeing.

00:23:02.887 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's very freeing.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.177 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:23:06.177 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:90%
You've got it.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.515 align:middle line:90%
It's just a matter of observing.

00:23:08.515 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
me to do this.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.806 align:middle line:84%
You can do this on your
own now in meditation,

00:23:11.806 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's important to
see the observation.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:84%
The first step in
healing is to be aware.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.706 align:middle line:90%
So you're aware of it.

00:23:17.706 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very good.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.982 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:23:19.982 --> 00:23:21.065 align:middle line:90%
Someone over here perhaps?

00:23:21.065 --> 00:23:22.402 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.402 --> 00:23:24.110 align:middle line:84%
You look like you had
something going on.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.025 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.025 --> 00:23:26.400 align:middle line:84%
First time you've
done this, yes?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: First time, yes.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: First time
you kind of meditated.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a rough-- yeah.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Tell.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Tells us because I
do this all the time.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's never
done it, I love that.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.046 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Mine was just
my journey growing up.

00:23:38.046 --> 00:23:39.946 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What
was a happy memory?

00:23:39.946 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, my first
happy memory I was thinking of

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.051 align:middle line:84%
was mom, or my dad and
my brother and I and all

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:84%
of our hunting experiences,
and how it was just

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
such wonderful times
filled with love.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And following that was-- my next
thought was choosing a college

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.630 align:middle line:90%
and going off to college.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And then going back to college
later for another career.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And just the path of
decision-making, growing up,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.582 align:middle line:90%
learning along the way.

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I bet you're
the only person in your family

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
that-- well, I shouldn't say it.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.404 align:middle line:84%
But I bet you are the
leader in your family.

00:24:15.404 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I bet you are.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I just feel that you are.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: May I bring
through your father, who's

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.422 align:middle line:90%
standing right behind you.

00:24:20.422 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:21.838 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:24:21.838 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK to cry.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I say
that-- because I'll be crying--

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and because it cleans,
it clears the soul.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It really, in a
way, honors them.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.682 align:middle line:90%
And we keep that in.

00:24:32.682 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not healthy.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.560 align:middle line:90%
We got to let things out.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.454 align:middle line:84%
So I know there must've been
another John in the family.

00:24:37.454 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So It'd be another John
with the name in the family.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.863 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would that
have been his or somebody

00:24:41.863 --> 00:24:43.760 align:middle line:90%
with that family name?

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:90%
His father?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.594 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It would've
been his father-in-law.

00:24:47.594 --> 00:24:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Father-in-law.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So I get him very,
very strongly here.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And I get a mother as well.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.855 align:middle line:84%
So I'd say your mother's
on this side of you,

00:24:53.855 --> 00:24:55.271 align:middle line:84%
your father's on
this side of you.

00:24:55.271 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And I need to tell
you your father--

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
have tools of his.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But I know that he says to me
if you would mention to my son

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that he owns my toolbox,
he has my tools,

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.500 align:middle line:84%
he even has my
saw, that he would

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:90%
know it's me speaking to him.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that please?

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I totally do.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.226 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that if I say that to you

00:25:12.226 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:84%
from this gentleman, that
he would say he got it.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:90%
He got it.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.260 align:middle line:90%
He understands it.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.300 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.112 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:25:18.112 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And you're his wife, are you?

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:90%
His wife?

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He loves
you, loves you, loves you.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind standing as
well please, sweetheart?

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that you brought him here,

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.090 align:middle line:84%
because his father and
mother is acknowledging

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that you brought
your husband here.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're thanking
you immensely

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
because he needed to
know that they're alive.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:84%
He needed to know life
after death exists.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:90%
And we need to know that.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you also have a son?

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.965 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:25:39.965 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Where is he right now?

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Fort Collins.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm very
aware there's an aunt also

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
that passed over on
your side of the family.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a lady
comes through that

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:50.187 align:middle line:90%
says she's an aunt of yours.

00:25:50.187 --> 00:25:51.020 align:middle line:90%
So be aware of that.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:51.982 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.982 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Is your mother still
living on the earth?

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Your mom?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Or has your mom passed over?

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Two weeks ago.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two weeks ago.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Can I bring her for you?

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I would love it.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you,
because I have here.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lady
who's tied to her.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And I would say it's
either her sister

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
or I'd say it's the
sister-in-law, because there's

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:90%
something like an aunt feeling.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Would you understand
that for me please?

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.018 align:middle line:90%
I know who I'm getting.

00:26:11.018 --> 00:26:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.647 align:middle line:90%
All of your family's coming.

00:26:13.647 --> 00:26:15.105 align:middle line:84%
Now we opened up
the whole curtain,

00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:16.092 align:middle line:90%
they're all popping in.

00:26:16.092 --> 00:26:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Popping in.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.636 align:middle line:90%
Now that we can do it.

00:26:17.636 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:90%
They can do it.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.472 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
April is very significant.

00:26:20.472 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what April
is significant for.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.623 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's a
birthday or an anniversary.

00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:84%
April is significant
between one of you.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.291 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure who
passed in April or--

00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A best friend
whose birthday was April 21.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he
passed over, correct?

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he did.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And they
want to say hello to you.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.561 align:middle line:84%
You did everything
you could for him.

00:26:34.561 --> 00:26:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who used
to build carpeting or do

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:90%
some woodwork together?

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My dad.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:90%
My dad.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your dad.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.185 align:middle line:84%
And didn't he show you how
to do some woodworking.

00:26:41.185 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
a lot of things.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.591 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
didn't he bring you

00:26:43.591 --> 00:26:46.183 align:middle line:84%
into either the garage or the
workbench and built something

00:26:46.183 --> 00:26:46.683 align:middle line:90%
with him?

00:26:46.683 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he did.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When
you're a little boy.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.268 align:middle line:84%
But as I got older,
he's helping me

00:26:50.268 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
with projects outside the house.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.356 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:26:53.356 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you must
still have my measuring stick.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:90%
My measurer.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand
that, the measuring stick?

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that how you call it?

00:26:59.130 --> 00:26:59.557 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Several.

00:26:59.557 --> 00:27:01.806 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm obviously
not a construction person.

00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:03.799 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
But you know what
he's talking about.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.715 align:middle line:84%
I know that he would like to
have his initials on certain

00:27:07.715 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of his tools, because he had
certain initials on there.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:10.993 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:27:10.993 --> 00:27:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've got a ruler
sitting on top of my box

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:84%
that has all my
tools with his ruler

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.985 align:middle line:84%
facing this way with
his initials on it.

00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.020 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I love being in your garage.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.077 align:middle line:90%
I love being at a workbench.

00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I love that you go
there all the time.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.084 align:middle line:84%
I love, let's say,
it's the board.

00:27:29.084 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:84%
That board thing with
those little pegs on it.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.550 align:middle line:90%
A peg board.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:32.672 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand the peg board

00:27:32.672 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing right there?

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's it.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know you have hooks

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
on the peg board,
different things.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.606 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware there's
also an extension

00:27:38.606 --> 00:27:40.020 align:middle line:90%
cord, which is up there.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like an extension cord,
like a long orange one.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Extension cord.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
to you, please?

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it does.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.356 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:27:46.356 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So I know that the family
visits you there all the time.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware
also there would've

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:84%
been a pickup truck or
someone has a pickup truck.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Do you have pickup
truck, please?

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In that garage,
sometimes you park it.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And you park there or in
the driveway, correct?

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Your dad's telling
me about that, OK?

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.898 align:middle line:84%
Because your dad said I got to
tell him about manly things.

00:28:02.898 --> 00:28:04.855 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.855 --> 00:28:05.855 align:middle line:90%
Because he's very manly.

00:28:05.855 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And I know that your-- god.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I know that your
mother goes back--

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:84%
did she pass before
your father, your mom?

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, my
dad passed first.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But very close?

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.518 align:middle line:84%
Was it timed two years
within each other?

00:28:18.518 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It feels
very, very close.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I almost got to tell
you, mother said to me

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:90%
she almost went before him.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So I got to tell you
that I think she gives me

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
this-- either she was ill, she
was in a hospital before him,

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and there was almost--
she almost went.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.080 align:middle line:90%
So if you remember that.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.485 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: When
I was born, they

00:28:37.485 --> 00:28:39.315 align:middle line:84%
said she would
pass from pneumonia

00:28:39.315 --> 00:28:39.890 align:middle line:90%
and that I would survive.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
not sure that's it.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I
know that she gives me

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that feeling I
thought in my mind.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:90%
I know-- OK, stop.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.625 align:middle line:84%
Your father's getting
too enthusiastic now.

00:28:48.625 --> 00:28:50.038 align:middle line:90%
Trying to find a suit for him.

00:28:50.038 --> 00:28:51.460 align:middle line:84%
They had to try to
find a suit for him.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.540 align:middle line:84%
They had to try to find a
suit for him for his coffin.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You had try to find some kind
of a suit for him to wear.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:56.234 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you didn't have one.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.294 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard to
find one to put on.

00:28:59.294 --> 00:28:59.918 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:28:59.918 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He wasn't
much of wearing suits.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, where are
we going to find this?

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.344 align:middle line:90%
Because he's not used to this.

00:29:04.344 --> 00:29:04.786 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:29:04.786 --> 00:29:07.161 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He was like, oh
my god, this sort of thing.

00:29:07.161 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.635 align:middle line:84%
It was all very nice, but
your father could care less.

00:29:10.635 --> 00:29:11.584 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Your father could care less.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.098 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I got
to tell you, is there

00:29:15.098 --> 00:29:16.790 align:middle line:84%
an Anne somewhere
in your family?

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Anne.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.915 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's a middle
name of most of my sisters.

00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your sisters.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.735 align:middle line:84%
Are there two sisters
that you have or three?

00:29:23.735 --> 00:29:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Three.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to give
love to them from your mother,

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about your
mother in the hospital

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:90%
before she passes over.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:84%
You understand she was in a
hospital before she passes?

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.259 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.664 align:middle line:90%
And did she pass away at home?

00:29:37.664 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.705 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
didn't she make

00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:41.284 align:middle line:84%
sure that she came
back home to pass?

00:29:41.284 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that your mother when

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.420 align:middle line:84%
she comes close
to me, she either

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
has trouble walking or just
trouble getting around.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:90%
She can't get around very well.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I know your mother has a lot
of dignity when she comes in,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:90%
when she's here.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.138 align:middle line:90%
She comes with dignity.

00:29:53.138 --> 00:29:54.469 align:middle line:90%
She wears a beautiful dress.

00:29:54.469 --> 00:29:55.885 align:middle line:84%
She's all dressed
up to the nines.

00:29:55.885 --> 00:29:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Please don't take
this the wrong way,

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
but she's better
dressed than you are.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.018 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:02.018 --> 00:30:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because she's a doll.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.890 align:middle line:84%
She's a real doll,
how she dresses up.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She would
point that out, too.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She would.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.764 align:middle line:84%
And she still is from
beyond the grave.

00:30:11.764 --> 00:30:13.035 align:middle line:90%
Some things never change.

00:30:13.035 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.514 align:middle line:84%
But I know that you
have jewelry of mine,

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
or the girls split
up my jewelery.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.381 align:middle line:84%
My daughters split
up my jewelery.

00:30:19.381 --> 00:30:20.380 align:middle line:90%
They split up the rings.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.022 align:middle line:90%
I know everyone has a ring.

00:30:22.022 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:90%
You have a ring on you, good.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:90%
I know that each one has a ring.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.897 align:middle line:84%
I know that her and your
dad are meeting at a dance.

00:30:26.897 --> 00:30:27.854 align:middle line:90%
They're going to dance.

00:30:27.854 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:90%
They met at a dance.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's
what they're talking about.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.436 align:middle line:90%
They've got each-- a dance.

00:30:32.436 --> 00:30:33.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know you
did everything you could.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Your mother was ready to go.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.757 align:middle line:90%
She was ready to pass away.

00:30:39.757 --> 00:30:41.715 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone was not able
to get there in time.

00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Who was that?

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My sister.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
please let her know it's OK?

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.212 align:middle line:84%
That she has to let
that one go, release it.

00:30:49.212 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Please release it, all right?

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.925 align:middle line:84%
I know that your dad, you
still-- I always get caps.

00:30:57.925 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:90%
For some reason get caps.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.462 align:middle line:84%
So I know you have
your father's cap.

00:31:01.462 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.937 align:middle line:84%
I know you have
that cap from him.

00:31:03.937 --> 00:31:04.978 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a hunting cap.

00:31:04.978 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's this sort of thing.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.560 align:middle line:90%
And I know I went to a lodge.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:90%
We like a lodge.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of a lodge.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that one
more thing-- I want, again,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:84%
repeat-- I want to thank
you for bringing him here.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to know
your mother's fine.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.320 align:middle line:84%
You helped her with
a great send off.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.284 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you she--
she was buried, wasn't she?

00:31:21.284 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her ashes.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Her
ashes were buried.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.809 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But I like the place
that you picked.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:90%
I've got to say that to you.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
That's very important,
because of the disagreeing.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave with that.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: God bless you.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm being drawn over
here to a woman.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.530 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a
mother figure to me,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to go over here.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.725 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if my
70s when I pass over.

00:31:37.725 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.755 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm going
to go to you, OK?

00:31:40.755 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:90%
So would you mind standing?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.239 align:middle line:90%
Your name, please?

00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Leanne.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leanne.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Leanne.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, would this be
mother, mother-in-law?

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mother-in-law.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:49.716 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mother-in-law.

00:31:49.716 --> 00:31:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Would you-- You're still
married to the husband, correct?

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, her son.

your father-in-law,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:03.633 align:middle line:84%

over there with her.

00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Would you know about that?

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.466 align:middle line:90%

moving a house around.

>>VAN PRAAGH: And you.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm getting
this gentleman here.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.496 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that he wasn't
associated with that lady,

00:32:44.496 --> 00:32:46.150 align:middle line:84%
but I'm still
around that family.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And when he lived

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.465 align:middle line:90%

and she's fine.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:84%

your mother being at a home,

00:32:58.330 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:90%
being at home.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.110 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've been
taking good care of her,

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and you've had to take care of
her more lately than last year.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
It feels as if she's needing
more attention, correct?

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
she's been sick.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.536 align:middle line:84%

know about going to a doctor's

00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:14.416 align:middle line:84%

00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
she's been going

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:90%

>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:17.468 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And I need to get
her heart checked.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.394 align:middle line:90%
So I need to do that.

00:33:20.394 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So the gentleman here is talking
about let her heart be checked.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
with what I'm hearing.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a doctor, but I got
to go with what I'm hearing.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Heart checked.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk
about steps in the house.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Steps in the house.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is there a second
floor going steps up there?

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She was in a
house with lots of stairs,

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and she can't use
them very well.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hate the stairs.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.232 align:middle line:90%
He said do not like the stairs.

00:33:39.232 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Do not like the stairs.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't like them at all.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And I need to get her out
of that place with stairs.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Don't want her falling
down on the stairs.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.620 align:middle line:90%
You heard it here first.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.990 align:middle line:90%
He's very concerned about her.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.284 align:middle line:84%
I think that he and your mom
had a very strong relationship.

00:33:51.284 --> 00:33:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
they were just connected.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.865 align:middle line:90%
The apple in his eye.

00:33:54.865 --> 00:33:56.260 align:middle line:90%
And I got to tell you that.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I think when I'm getting a
memory from this man playing

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:00.159 align:middle line:90%
the piano when he's younger.

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Whethere it was a
piano being played.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's an upright piano
and I'm playing that.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would ask you to please
to ask your mom about memories

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.030 align:middle line:84%
of a piano and if
they'd sit together

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:11.296 align:middle line:84%
on Saturday nights having
piano time, playing music.

00:34:11.296 --> 00:34:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
worry about things.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Don't want you to
worry about things.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.818 align:middle line:84%
And the message really
for your mother to go

00:34:16.818 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:90%
take care of her health, please.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that.

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:19.392 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:34:19.392 --> 00:34:20.306 align:middle line:90%

00:34:22.795 --> 00:34:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to
talk about a gentleman that

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.795 align:middle line:90%
comes to see me here.

00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:28.336 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling this man is a father
figure, it feels like to me.

00:34:28.336 --> 00:34:30.909 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you that I feel
like this man would have known

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:84%
either of a coin collection
of some kind or a stamp

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.049 align:middle line:90%
collection?

00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:36.715 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:36.715 --> 00:34:38.199 align:middle line:90%

Your grandfather?

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And do you currently
have that collection?

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:90%

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.995 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of people
coming in here left and right.

00:34:46.995 --> 00:34:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And would this have been your
mother's side of the family,

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:90%

Driving in a car.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So you would have known
him in the lifetime.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.320 align:middle line:84%

connection toward the Florida

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.140 align:middle line:90%

>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:10.848 --> 00:35:11.401 align:middle line:90%

Yeah.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Vacationed a lot down there.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:13.225 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:35:13.225 --> 00:35:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And would you have known about
going on a little vacation

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.278 align:middle line:84%
or going to Florida
with your grandfather

00:35:17.278 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:84%

>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:90%

and he said most--
what did you say?

00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
The lessons that we all
learned, and he said it's

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.732 align:middle line:90%
a family lesson.

00:35:26.732 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And he said, some
turned out great.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.790 align:middle line:90%

They're some are over

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.093 align:middle line:90%
some are over there.

00:35:40.093 --> 00:35:41.527 align:middle line:84%
And he's really
sorry about that.

00:35:41.527 --> 00:35:42.985 align:middle line:84%
He tried to doing
the best he could

00:35:42.985 --> 00:35:45.100 align:middle line:84%
with keeping everybody
together, OK?

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I also get a
grandmother with him.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So his wife must
be there because I

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.760 align:middle line:84%
feel like I want to come in
here with a serving cup of tea,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.334 align:middle line:84%
and dinners, a dinnerware,
and a beautiful lace apron,

00:35:56.334 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:90%
and all of her dinner stuff.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
important to this lady.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that
what you appear to be,

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.770 align:middle line:90%
what your image is.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
she's from, about.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your grandfather
keeps on brushing her hair,

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.922 align:middle line:90%
brushing her hair.

00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you,
before he passes away,

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:12.550 align:middle line:90%
my mind isn't mine.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.326 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I don't know if I

00:36:14.326 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
lost my mind, like
I was in a coma.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I lost my mind.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm not myself.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.885 align:middle line:84%
And I know that things had to
be done for me, like papers

00:36:21.885 --> 00:36:26.145 align:middle line:84%
had to be signed in his
honor, like documents,

00:36:26.145 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.824 align:middle line:84%
Making up his mind for
him, this sort of a thing.

00:36:29.824 --> 00:36:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your mother
has her mother's dishes.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:90%
She has all her things.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She does.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:35.850 align:middle line:90%
She does.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
has a candle set.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Candle set.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Everything.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The holidays
are very important to her.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.468 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
really important

00:36:41.468 --> 00:36:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that someone has her sweater.

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I know that she either
played cards every week,

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:84%
or she meets her
friends once a week.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They loved
to play cards, yeah.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I'm being
shown that, playing cards.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Playing
cards once a week.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We all played
cards together, yeah.

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love that.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And they all love
that as well, OK?

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:90%
They all love that as well.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that in the family,
if I go back in time,

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that there
was a woman or women who,

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.922 align:middle line:90%
one day, they now play cards.

00:37:02.922 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But in those days, they
might have got together

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.520 align:middle line:90%
sewing things.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.746 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It was
like a sewing club.

00:37:07.746 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, sewing dresses
and sewing things, OK?

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I know there's a Jack.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So I know the name
Jack is significant.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yup, yup.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
you understand that.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very
aware there's a man

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:84%
who'd be in the spirit
world who would've

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
smoked a pipe when
he was living here.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.791 align:middle line:84%
So very, very aware of
that, that that pipe would

00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:84%
be significant to you and
that you'd remember that.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.406 align:middle line:84%
I'm also very, very
impressed with bowling.

00:37:25.406 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
my grandparents

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.055 align:middle line:90%
bowled all the time.

00:37:28.055 --> 00:37:29.138 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm bowling.

00:37:29.138 --> 00:37:29.734 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.734 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Stuff like that.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
were amazing bowlers.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.858 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If I look
at my form, by the way,

00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:90%
my form isn't bad here.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.950 align:middle line:84%
As they giving me, I'm going,
like, right down the aisle.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.472 align:middle line:84%
So I know there
would be trophies.

00:37:39.472 --> 00:37:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I know there would be
acknowledgements of that.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.625 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
they're very proud of that

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and that you remember this.

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:90%
This was very, very significant.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said really what
your soul lesson is, all of us

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:84%
share the same one, which
is unconditional love.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, interesting.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And loving people for
who they are differently.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So the diversification of
your family, they said.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And even the ones that are
not together right now,

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:05.810 align:middle line:84%
who are separated, you have
to find the love for them.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
you to stay-- They

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.619 align:middle line:90%
don't want you to stay mad.

00:38:09.619 --> 00:38:11.910 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you to say,
they should have done that.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:90%
They should have done that.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.740 align:middle line:90%
They could've done that.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.484 align:middle line:90%
Why did they treat mom this way?

00:38:15.484 --> 00:38:16.400 align:middle line:90%
You're having trouble.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
don't want to do that.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you want to do that?

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know
what their backgrounds are.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:26.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't know if they don't
love themselves enough so they

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.000 align:middle line:90%
could have done something else.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.794 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
how much they feel

00:38:29.794 --> 00:38:31.710 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get enough
love from their family,

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't
act a certain way.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
people's backstories.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a backstory.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's up to you.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming
back to remind you

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.944 align:middle line:84%
of your family-- soul
family group lesson.

00:38:43.944 --> 00:38:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, there's
generational anger--

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's
generational anger.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: that's
getting pushed on.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So it's
not being held.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let's resolve it.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not being held.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So it's up to you
to heal it if you could, right?

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.122 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't repeat itself time
after time after time again.

00:38:56.122 --> 00:38:57.371 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm working on it.

00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:58.180 align:middle line:90%
I really am.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.054 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:38:59.054 --> 00:39:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it's
repetitive from the old.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So you want to bring it into
the new, into the light.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You wan to bring it to-- I
would say take the high road.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.346 align:middle line:90%
Less traffic.

00:39:07.346 --> 00:39:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:08.845 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Listen.

00:39:08.845 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You can never
control other people.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.660 align:middle line:84%
You can never
control situations. .

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:84%
You can control how
you respond to things.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.062 align:middle line:84%
So if you can respond to
things in a loving way,

00:39:18.062 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:84%
then you're living in
alignment and integration

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.250 align:middle line:90%
with soul's lesson.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.751 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most important
thing from your family today.

00:39:23.751 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.426 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:26.426 --> 00:39:29.412 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.412 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, I want to
thank you all very, very much

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.180 align:middle line:90%
for being here today.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I hope you got a lot out of this
and realize that you are just

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.640 align:middle line:84%
a soul having a human
experience, not the other way

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that really, it's
up to you to make

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:84%
a difference every
moment of your path.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.170 align:middle line:84%
You never know who's going
to walk upon your path

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.187 align:middle line:84%
and what difference
you're going to make.

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I got to tell you,
there are no accidents.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.353 align:middle line:90%
There are no coincidences.

00:39:53.353 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.217 align:middle line:84%
Coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous.

00:39:56.217 --> 00:39:57.675 align:middle line:84%
And to be true to
your soul's self,

00:39:57.675 --> 00:40:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and to really learn those
lessons, love is the only way.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So be an influence--
a positive influence

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.220 align:middle line:84%
with love to every
single person you meet.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.865 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:05.865 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And with that, I send you
my love and my appreciation.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for being here.
