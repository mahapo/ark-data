00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, world-renowned
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.096 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:33.524 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:34.476 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:35.404 align:middle line:90%
I love the enthusiasm.

00:00:35.404 --> 00:00:35.904 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:36.404 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also
very much at home

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
for watching for another
episode of "Spirit Talk," where

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I take you one step
closer to Heaven.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And today, I thought it
would be a very good idea

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.320 align:middle line:84%
to talk about something which
many, many people ask me about.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is
protection-- protection.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And they say, you
know I do psychic work

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
or I walk around
the world every day,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and do I need to protect
myself from energies

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:90%
that are out there?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say yes and no, in that
we do walk in a sea of thought.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember that
everything is thought.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.321 align:middle line:84%
Everything is created
with our thoughts.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
The world around us is
created with the thoughts

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
that we send out.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's something that I
want to share with you guys.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Here it comes.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are things.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are real,
tangible things.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Now in this three-dimensional
world, we don't see thought.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:90%
We see each other physically.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
We see the physical world we
live in, the houses, the trees.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
We see the physical things.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.450 align:middle line:84%
But there are a
multitude of dimensions.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And in another dimension,
it is a world of thought.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:90%
So thoughts are seen.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So from the world of the
spirit, from their perspective,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
they see all the thoughts
that are around you.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
They see thoughts that
people send to you.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very real,
real world of thought.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And they live also in
a world of thought.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is so interesting.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
How many people in this audience
today, before you got here,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:90%
took a shower or a bath?

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.043 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are not
raising your hand.

00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I won't point you out because
your neighbor probably knows.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We're very concerned, a lot of
us, about our physical well,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
our physical health, our
physical cleanliness.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And we wake up every day.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
We clean ourselves-- the
hygiene, physical hygiene.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
What about your spirit hygiene?

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.616 align:middle line:84%
What about cleansing
your spirit body?

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
What about the
auric field that's

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:90%
around every living person?

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So today, I'm going
to share with you just

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
a different insight, a different
perspective, just something

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
to think about-- that we live
in this world of thought.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:84%
When someone thinks of you, when
they have a thought about you,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%
where does that thought go?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Directly to you. [SHOO]
Thoughts are like bullets,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and it goes to the
intended target.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:90%
[SHOO] It goes right there.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So many times when I
look at people-- and not

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
for you particularly
here today-- yet,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
yet-- but many times I'll see
people, and all around them,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
the auric field, I'll see
thoughts from other people.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
I call them foreign thoughts--
other people's energy.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.161 align:middle line:84%
Have you all heard
about psychic vampires?

00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.826 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you know a few
psychic vampires, right?

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We all know some psychic
vampires-- people

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
that you go to and you
feel drained afterwards.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my gosh, I don't
want to be around these people

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:90%
I feel drained.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.356 align:middle line:90%
I'm exhausted.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
your husband when

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.855 align:middle line:90%
you wake up in the morning.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:38.254 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:90%
But we all know them, right?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:90%
You all know these people.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I just got to
get away from these people.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
something about them.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:90%
They just drain.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:90%
They pull the energy, right?

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's really-- and it
happens to a lot of us.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Now the more aware we
are that this exists,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.880 align:middle line:84%
the better we can live in
an everyday environment.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So just a little story
I'm going to tell you.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
interesting story, and one

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
which stays with me throughout
my whole career of mediumship.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Many, many years ago when I
was doing private readings,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember I had an
afternoon reading.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:90%
And I prepared the space for it.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I was all set.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I had the incense going.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
I had the music going.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I put myself in
a nice meditative

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:90%
space, a nice receptive space.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.255 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:90%
It was all good.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:90%
And the doorbell rings.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And I answer the door.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lady
standing there.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at this lady.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, my gosh.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:90%
This lady's aura was in tatters.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Did you all see-- you've
seen Charles Schulz.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Remember Pig Pen,
Charles Schulz?

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Around this lady, her
aura, which is really

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
like an egg-- usually
an egg shape of light.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And it's a membrane
egg shape that's

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:90%
protecting us energetically.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
This lady's aura had tears in
it, spots in it, torn all over.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:90%
It was gray and brown.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.167 align:middle line:84%
And just, it was a
wreck-- tattered.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Tattered is the only word.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so sorry
for this lady.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And of course I said, please
come on into my house.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Make yourself at home.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:90%
She sat down.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.115 align:middle line:84%
And the moment she sat
down, she started crying.

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:09.465 align:middle line:90%
She started crying her eyes out.

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said, James,
what's wrong with me?

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I feel so depressed
all the time.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%
And I can't sleep at night.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just worried
about everything.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired all the time.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:90%
And she was crying her eyes out.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at her.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.796 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the
auric field-- what

00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:90%
was left of that auric field.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I looked at everyone's
energy on her.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said to this lady, it's
not what's wrong with you.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:90%
It's who's wrong with you.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Whose energy are you
carrying with you?

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Whose energy are you carry
with you and making your own?

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's very much
like if you drive

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
on a highway or a freeway,
70, 80 miles per hour.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:49.797 align:middle line:90%
And you keep on going.

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you're going
to have to stop and clean

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
the headlights off,
because bugs get attracted,

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and dirt gets attracted
there to that light.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with your light.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Many times, other
people's energy

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
will sit in your field--
in your auric field.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
protect yourself or have

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
an awareness or a mindfulness
about cleansing that and being

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.145 align:middle line:84%
responsible for your
spirit well being,

00:06:13.145 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
you can walk around life with
other people's energy on you,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
sucking away your own prana,
your own energy of life.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
As you are all sitting
here going, oh no.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I did with this lady was
I didn't say anything to her.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I was working with her.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.952 align:middle line:84%
And I was removing
energy from her field

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:90%
without her knowing it.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to her, and I'm
just taking the energy off.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking it off
psychicly or energetically,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm pulling it off her.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And there's ways of doing that.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was pulling off the
energy and not telling her.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.799 align:middle line:90%
I'm just talking to her.

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Probably about 10
minutes, within 10 minute,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
she said to me, are you
doing something to me?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm feeling
like my old self again.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I feel young again.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I feel young again.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And a smile returned
to her face.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.545 align:middle line:90%
And it was amazing.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, well, the
energy that you've been feeling

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and whose energy you've
been riding with,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
has been your son's, your
daughter's, your neighbor's,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
your employer's.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:90%
She goes, oh, yes, yes.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And she remembered an argument
she'd got in with them.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.028 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't getting along
with certain family members.

00:07:20.028 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was all sitting there.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Because thoughts are things.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:90%
This is energy.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's got to be
ways-- and today, I

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
want to really share with you
different techniques which

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
you can use in order to-- I
don't like to use the word

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
"protect," but just
to be responsible

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
with your energetic field.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Because when we say the word
"protect," it means, oh my,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
there's something
negative or fearful.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.539 align:middle line:84%
We go down to that
fearful level.

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
say it's fearful.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It's being responsible.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's being responsible
for your well

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.710 align:middle line:84%
being on your spiritual, mental,
physical, and emotional levels.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.106 align:middle line:84%
So today, I'd like to
share with you first,

00:07:58.106 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
the first technique is through
meditation-- guided meditation

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to help you with
and share with you to start

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to recognize certain
energies that's in your field

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:90%
and release them.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Cool?

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's get started.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.879 align:middle line:84%
And everybody at home, you
can also do this of course.

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to close your
eyes, that'd be the best thing.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I find that when
your eyes are opened,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
your senses are not fully
there, not fully aware

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of the inside which we're
going to be working with

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and the auric field.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So just sit comfortably
with your eyes closed.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can listen to the
music behind my voice.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:90%
We're going to play that.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And just give
yourself this moment

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
to just be with yourself
and your own energy.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to listen
to the sound of my voice

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.044 align:middle line:90%
and the music behind my voice.

00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful of
your feet on the floor.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of your
legs, your backs

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
in the chairs, your shoulders
and your arms, your chest,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
your stomach, your neck,
your head, and just relax.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Try to relax.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Try to send out a
thought from yourself,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:84%
generating a thought of
relaxation, of peace,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of calmness.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
That's all you have to
do-- with the realization,

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.310 align:middle line:84%
the remembrance that
you indeed are a soul,

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
a spirit having a human
condition-- not the other way

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And that you are a
beautiful bright star

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
of light-- a beautiful
golden light.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
As you sit in this
seat, your energy

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
is so much more than
just this physical body.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.500 align:middle line:90%
You shine.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
You shimmer through realms and
realms of life and existences.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:90%
You are god.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:90%
You are the creative spark.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:90%
You are that beauty.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So as we sit together and you
hear the sound of my voice,

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
just remember this realization
that you are indeed

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:84%
this god spark,
this light being.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
To bring that further
into your awareness,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:90%
we're going to use the breath.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale, I
will guide you to inhale.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Inhale through your nose and
imagine a beautiful fountain

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of gold light coming
into the top of the head,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
swimming through every
part of the body,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.300 align:middle line:84%
illuminating every cell,
every muscle, and every organ

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:84%
with that beautiful
golden light--

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
the god spirit, the light
spirit, the oneness spirit,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:90%
the loving spirit.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale
out of your mouth,

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to envision
a gray mist which

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
represents any
old energies which

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
are a part of you,
any old belief

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
systems, any
limitations, any fears.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.652 align:middle line:84%
You're going to release,
relax, and let them go.

00:10:58.652 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So together let's bring in
that beautiful golden light.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Bring it into the body
and all around you.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.768 align:middle line:90%
Holding it two, three, four.

00:11:10.768 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And let it go-- all that
gray mist goes down,

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:84%
falls down upon to Mother Earth,
where she recycles it to love.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:90%
Energy is always being used.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Earth is a
wonderful, wonderful element.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
She always wants to assist
us and sustain our lives.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Think of Mother
Earth as a magnet.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.550 align:middle line:84%
She pulls the denser,
heavier energies--

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.200 align:middle line:84%
the energies that
are not yours--

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
pulls them away from
you to recycle to love.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So together again, let's imagine
this beautiful golden light

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
as we inhale, coming
through the body.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Then hold it two, three, four.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You feel that good.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And just one more time.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And inhale that
beautiful golden light.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And hold it two, three, four.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.395 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:12:18.395 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the old.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Feel renewed and refreshed,
bright and light-- bright

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And now with your
eyes closed, I would

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
like for you to imagine that
you are going to step out

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
of your body-- stepping
out of the body,

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and turning, and looking
at the physical body--

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
just looking down at
your physical bodies.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You're standing in
front of yourself.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that,
I just want you

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of scanning
the top of the head,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of
scanning the shoulders.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And just feel anyone else's
energy in your space.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Whether they're in the spirit
world, in the physical world,

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
whose thoughts are
upon your shoulders?

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Whose thoughts are
upon your head?

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:84%
What thoughts are all
around that physicalness

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:90%
of you and your auric field?

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Just become aware as you
step out of that body

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking
down, kind of scanning

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
the body from the
top of the head,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.930 align:middle line:90%
now going down to the throat.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you find any
foreign energies,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
anyone else's energy
stuck around you?

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
If they are, just use your
hand like a scoop, [SHOO],

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
imagine, like a scoop,
and pulling that energy,

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
sending it back to Mother
Earth, sending it down.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Let her recycle to love.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Many times around the throat,
people's energy's there.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.779 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
And then the heart also.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the emotions
that you hold on

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
from other people,
old relationships that

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:84%
mightn't have been fulfilled,
grieving situations

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:90%
that you're holding onto.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine pulling them
away from that heart space,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and also in your solar
plexus-- very strong

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
psychic center, the
seed of knowingness.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Any foreign energies
that are not

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
in atunement to your vibration,
let them be released.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Release old energies.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Release old emotions.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Release old expectations.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Release expectations of others.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Release fears that other
people have placed upon you,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and that you have made
your own-- whether it's

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
your parents, whether it's your
family, whether it's employees,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.970 align:middle line:90%
employers, whether it's society.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Release those peoples' energy.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Let Mother Earth
recycle to love.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice, you'll
feel them peeled away,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:90%
almost like an onion skin.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:90%
You feel that?

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And you'll begin to feel your
own self emerging, getting

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
brighter, and
brighter, and brighter.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And now what I'd like you
to do as you sit there,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.190 align:middle line:84%
is I want you to remember
today anyone you spoke

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to-- anyone you spoke to
in the hallway waiting

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to come into the show.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.198 align:middle line:84%
And people at home, anyone you
spoke to today, whether it's

00:15:21.198 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
on a telephone,
whether it's in person.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Just realize that
everybody you speak with,

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
you interact with face to
face, on the telephone--

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:90%
you're taking on their energy.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I want you
to send back their energy.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Send back their
energy, back to them.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
However you want to do
that, just acknowledging

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:84%
them and sending it back
with love-- sending it back

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.380 align:middle line:90%
with love.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Send back the energy
they left there

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
with you, the
conversations that you had.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.574 align:middle line:90%
Just send it back with love.

00:15:53.574 --> 00:15:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Just do that for a
couple of moments.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:90%
You'll notice peeling away.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.010 align:middle line:90%
This is a good one.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And get to the point where
you are right now in this room

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
and back to your own self.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like you to envision
those same people that you

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
had an interaction with, I want
you to get your energy back

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.845 align:middle line:90%
from them.

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start to feel it
come back to you, like stardust

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
coming into the
top of your head.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And fill yourself back
up with the energy

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that you depleted by
giving it to somebody

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.546 align:middle line:84%
else in your conversations
and in your interactions.

00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
With all the
interactions, you'll

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:49.369 align:middle line:84%
begin to feel like this
beautiful starlight come in.

00:16:49.369 --> 00:16:51.928 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel that?

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And send love to every
one you interacted

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:90%
with today or this week.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.116 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:02.116 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want you just to
concentrate on your heart--

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful space of
love, this lovely center

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional
love and healing.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a beautiful green
light emerging in front of you

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.940 align:middle line:84%
from your heart
center and spinning

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your head
to the bottom of your feet.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Spin that green light around.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And any excess
energy in your space

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that does not belong to you
goes right down to Mother Earth,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
once again to be
recycled to love.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And feel the love who you are.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:40.197 align:middle line:84%
Fill that glimmer, that glimpse,
that light which is you.

00:17:40.197 --> 00:17:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at the smiles.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Love, by its very nature, is
not to keep, but to share.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So please send that beautiful
green light of energy

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:84%
to the person on
your right side.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And soon the entire room is
filled with this loving energy.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And we ask, divine
heavily parent,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
we ask your blessing
on this meeting today.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
draw near to us.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Spirit friends, be clear to us.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Spirit friends, slow
down your voices.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.100 align:middle line:84%
When we hear, the
heart rejoices.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Give us glimpses of eternity.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Let us know that you are free.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Give us names, and
facts, and places.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Help us to understand
Heaven's graces.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Send your thoughts upon me
with emotion and simplicity,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
as we sit together in
peace, love, and harmony.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And slowly open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you look so much
brighter and lighter.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And you at home, whoa.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's so interesting
because-- how do you feel?

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Different.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Lighter, right?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:90%
You feel lighter?

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.689 align:middle line:84%
So I love it, because
it's just an energy

00:18:59.689 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I like to work with when you
don't carry other people's

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
stuff around with you.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:84%
It's so hard living in
this human world as it is.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But then, when you carry
someone else's stuff with

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
you-- and you don't have
to carry your kid's stuff.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.345 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to carry
your partner's stuff.

00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You can love them without having
affect you in a negative way--

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that you can shine
your own energy.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.910 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:90%
You understand this one?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:90%
You're all about mom.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.556 align:middle line:84%
You're all about being a
mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.

00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.262 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:30.262 --> 00:19:31.845 align:middle line:84%
Before we continue
on, I'm going to do

00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:84%
a-- I'll bring a person up
here for another exercise.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But a couple of questions that
you might have, if any of you

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.775 align:middle line:84%
have questions you'd like to
ask about the exercise or about

00:19:39.775 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the psychic work as far
as the protection work,

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, or owning
your own space.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Any questions you might have?

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, my love.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What's your name?

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.455 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Amber.

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Amber.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.224 align:middle line:90%
What's your question honey?

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So when you
discussed about people

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.255 align:middle line:84%
we've talked to in
this reality level.

00:19:57.255 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, in the
physical world right now.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.796 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In the
physical world,

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
does it also with
the spirit world,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
do they attach to
our auras as well?

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, a great,
great, great, great question.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you something,
which this is the way it is.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural law.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And the natural law
is like attracts like.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.031 align:middle line:84%
And I find that if
you're owning your space,

00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and you really are
coming from this loving

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.837 align:middle line:84%
vibration, this
loving energy, and I

00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
don't like to use
the word protection,

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to be
responsible for that space

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and being loving
and light energy.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.180 align:middle line:84%
You will attract only that
which is on that vibration.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And if people love
you, they're not

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.762 align:middle line:84%
going to attach
themselves like that.

00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own
lives on the other side

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:90%
of life, their own.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Really, we are much,
much bigger and more

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:90%
than just this physical world.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
This is such a small part
of who we are as a spirit.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.322 align:middle line:90%
This is just a teeny part of us.

00:20:49.322 --> 00:20:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like an inverted triangle
and this the very tip,

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:90%
and it just goes [WHOOSH].

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So they have so many
more things to do.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Now saying that, they will come
around you and influence you,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:90%
project thoughts.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
They'll many times
will try to give you

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
inspirations, if you will, and
try to send, like, I love you,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.714 align:middle line:84%
take care of yourself,
or whatever it might be.

00:21:08.714 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
times the thoughts

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.171 align:middle line:84%
that we have every day
are coming from the spirit

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
world, who are coming
close to that auric field

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and sending you those things.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But they're not there to
attack you or hurt you.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to say
something, and people

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
that are watching this
have also asked me this.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Can someone possess you?

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Can someone really attack you?

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I believe that there is no evil.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I think evil is created in
man's mind, in human's mind.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that's such a thing.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that we
are creating our world.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
We create with
everything that we think.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I also will tell you
that as like attracts

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.765 align:middle line:84%
like, if you have negative
thoughts and bad thoughts,

00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
well, that's what you can
create in the atmosphere,

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and like will attract like.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So you might attract negative
people in your life experience,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:84%
in your physical world and
in the spirit world, maybe

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
those unevolved beings.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But everybody in this room
and there watching, not.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you're already
at a realization

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.362 align:middle line:90%
that there's something more.

00:22:07.362 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And I believe there's really
just-- I believe there's love.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in evil.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.644 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:22:11.644 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
It's everything in the mind.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It's what we create
with our minds.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.709 align:middle line:84%
So do we have a clean
mind, a dirty mind?

00:22:16.709 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I want to say,
also, with protection, that you

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
need to make sure that you're
responsible for your work

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and for your bodies
and your spirit.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:24.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you, darling.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Anyone else have a question?

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.595 align:middle line:84%
OK my lovely lady,
you have a question?

00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:29.596 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:30.303 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:22:30.303 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cheryl.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.149 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi Cheryl.

00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:33.106 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:22:33.106 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I noticed when I
was clearing out the energy,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.865 align:middle line:84%
you told us to use our hands
and draw the foreign energy out

00:22:38.865 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:90%
of our space.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right, right.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:40.828 align:middle line:90%
I watched you do it.

00:22:40.828 --> 00:22:42.286 align:middle line:84%
And I said remember
I said step out

00:22:42.286 --> 00:22:44.285 align:middle line:84%
of the body and kind of
imagine you're doing it.

00:22:44.285 --> 00:22:46.687 align:middle line:84%
And you also did it with
your physical, which is fine.

00:22:46.687 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
You went like that, and you
scooped some stuff out there

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
in the chakra of the throat.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:90%
That's good too.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.257 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:22:53.257 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And the
question that I have is,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that sometimes the
energy that I was pulling out

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
was easy to pull out,
and sometimes there

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
was energy that was a little
more resistant and more

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:90%
harder to pull out.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just a little curious
about why that would be,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and if there's any
techniques to work

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.602 align:middle line:90%
with the more resistant energy?

00:23:10.602 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You might find
that when you do the cleansing

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
exercise and when you do
the protection, as you said,

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
there'll be some energies
you can easily remove,

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and others-- especially
in the emotional centers--

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:90%
might be harder to get out of.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:90%
There also can be cords.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We call them cords, where
people have-- they're

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.449 align:middle line:90%
kind of like got right in there.

00:23:30.449 --> 00:23:32.365 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
have lower back problems?

00:23:32.365 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Some people here have
lower back problems?

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So lower back problems
usually is the first chakra,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.050 align:middle line:90%
which is the base of the tail.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And guess what that
is, that center?

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:90%
That's your survival.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And who in your life is looking
to you for their survival?

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So if there are
people in your life

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.710 align:middle line:84%
that are depending upon you for
their survival, their security,

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
many times you'll have
their energy right here.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's called a cord stuck
into your chakra, that energy

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.400 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that my friend,
is sometimes harder,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.512 align:middle line:84%
because it's been there
for years perhaps.

00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
make-- and that's

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
what I said earlier-- you
make their energy your energy.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do that?

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to be consistent
with using the protection,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:84%
using the exercises
to scoop it out.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Or another one I like
to use, I imagine

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful golden scissor.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just cut the
cords-- ch-ch-ch-ch.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.484 align:middle line:84%
And send it back
to Mother Nature.

00:24:28.484 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very good.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.795 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Let me work with you.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:32.890 align:middle line:90%
You want to come up?

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to work with you
a little bit more, too.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you another technique.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.013 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm going to give you
Chery, my lovely Cheryl.

00:24:38.013 --> 00:24:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Cheryl's up here.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And you guys in the audience
can do this, and you at home

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.385 align:middle line:90%
also can do this.

00:24:41.385 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
This is another
technique for protection.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.837 align:middle line:90%
And I love this one.

00:24:46.837 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.917 align:middle line:84%
I do this every single
morning in the shower.

00:24:50.917 --> 00:24:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I find it easy in
the shower because I

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:90%
can remember it that way.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning
when I take a shower,

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:90%
I will cleanse my physical body.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And then I stop.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I let the spray hit
the top of my head.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.209 align:middle line:90%
So imagine that.

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.375 align:middle line:84%
So I am going to have you
close your eyes right now.

00:25:04.375 --> 00:25:05.857 align:middle line:84%
And what I want
you to do, Cheryl,

00:25:05.857 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is I just want you to once
again to get into your space,

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:90%
centering yourself.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And I really want you to just
connect the bottom of your feet

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:90%
to Mother Earth.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:13.351 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine.

00:25:13.351 --> 00:25:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Use your imagination.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And envision like the roots
going down to Mother Earth.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:90%
And everybody here do that, too.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Now, Mother Earth is wonderful.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.890 align:middle line:90%
She's nurturing.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:90%
She's loving.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:90%
She's secure.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:90%
She's like a magnet.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.425 align:middle line:84%
She'll take all that
dense, heavy energy that

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
doesn't belong to us,
and she will recycle it.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:90%
So you got it.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.551 align:middle line:84%
And see the shift of
energy right away.

00:25:33.551 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So now my love, I just
want you to envision

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:84%
right above your head,
coming out from the sky,

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:84%
from the heavens, a
beautiful waterfall.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And the waterfall
can be any colors

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:90%
or a multitude of colors.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It could be reds, and oranges,
and yellows, and greens, blues,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.800 align:middle line:84%
purples, magentas--
whatever you feel

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that you would love that
represents a beautiful heavenly

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.740 align:middle line:90%
light, a cleansing light.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And the water is a
beautiful temperature.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:90%
It's very perfect for you.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And just all of you
can envision now,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:84%
envision that at the
top of your head,

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and running down the side of
the body, and through the body.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And all these
different colors is

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
where it goes to certain
areas of the body

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:84%
where there are
some people's energy

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that are stuck inside
you and around you.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
you to be mindful.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.425 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:26:22.425 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I see it going.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And just directing it.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And it also knows
with its intelligence

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:84%
where to cleanse
out on the inside.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's a waterfall.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.862 align:middle line:84%
And the waterfall
just goes through you.

00:26:33.862 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And it takes out.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It cleanses out from the
inside all the debris

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.710 align:middle line:84%
from other people, pulls away
all the cords, all the debris.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Cleansing it and cleansing it.

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And it goes down the
bottom of your feet,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.980 align:middle line:90%
out your feet to Mother Earth.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And feel all that debris
coming out of your toes,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and your feet, and
also your fingertips.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And just let that cycle--
just this waterfall.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Just keep on going with it
and letting all of that debris

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.930 align:middle line:84%
from other people, your
own negative thoughts,

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.267 align:middle line:84%
your own limitations, own fears,
just going down, going down

00:27:07.267 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:90%
and cleansing.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:10.805 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.805 --> 00:27:12.513 align:middle line:84%
How are you feeling
as you're doing this?

00:27:12.513 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, marvelous.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Share with
us what you're feeling.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.963 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
the first area where

00:27:16.963 --> 00:27:19.594 align:middle line:84%
I noticed a big
release was the back.

00:27:19.594 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
lower back right here.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a little
resistant at first,

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:30.860 align:middle line:84%
but when you prompted
to use different colors,

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.299 align:middle line:84%
that was a creative queue that
really helped shift the energy.

00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And could
wash that out better.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.933 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Keep on
using that meditation.

00:27:39.933 --> 00:27:41.694 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm going to amp it up.

00:27:41.694 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
When I say I'm
going to amp it up,

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.735 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
bring in some energy.

00:27:44.735 --> 00:27:51.329 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.329 --> 00:27:53.745 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to clean
you up a little bit over here.

00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you're feeling.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm feeling
a very soft energy

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
coming down the back of
my head and into the spine

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and emanating out from there.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it's more of
my own, very own soul essence.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It feels also like
grace-- energy of grace.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Energy of grace.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.358 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:19.358 --> 00:28:23.154 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.154 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now right
here and here my love,

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.280 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body,
there's a little bit

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of a little arthritis,
or a little bit

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:90%
right here and right here.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Now I am.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.181 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just want to
clear it out a little bit.

00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:39.509 align:middle line:90%
It's in the joints.

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:40.300 align:middle line:90%
It's in the joints.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And how do I see that?

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.037 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel it intuitively,
and sometimes I'll

00:28:46.037 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:90%
see it as particles.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.597 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not necessarily
someone else's energy

00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:90%
that's in here that I'm feeling.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It might be genetic from
the family line going back.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And we carry that.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.912 align:middle line:84%
The soul brings that
in this life time now.

00:28:56.912 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I also know in the middle
part of the back, right

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.354 align:middle line:84%
around here, there's a little
bit of imbalance going on here.

00:29:03.354 --> 00:29:04.270 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.083 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm just going
to bring some energy there.

00:29:08.083 --> 00:29:10.326 align:middle line:84%
And just keep on imagining
this is sloughing off.

00:29:10.326 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And did you ever want to
do music in your life?

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I see it
right here in your throat

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:84%
chakra, the expressive
chakra, that there's music,

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.810 align:middle line:90%
but you stopped singing.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.320 align:middle line:84%
You stopped the
music at one time.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
say to you, when

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:84%
you stop the creativity
expression, it just [SWISH],

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.170 align:middle line:90%
the color goes right back.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.878 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
expand that little bit.

00:29:32.878 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And you also have listened
to too many people

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:90%
to tell you who you are.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's not who you are.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.901 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:41.901 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There also
might be, sometimes you

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
might find there's a little bit
of arrhythmia with the heart

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.860 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.340 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Because as I see this here, and
I'm just cleansing this out.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.719 align:middle line:84%
And she's doing the work
with the protection.

00:29:53.719 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:90%
She's running her energy.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:90%
She running the energy.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And she's bringing
it, clearing it out.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And you should start
definitely feeling something.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.009 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Each place
that you worked I feel.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.645 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you carry
your mother's energy with you

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.640 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.306 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:11.306 --> 00:30:12.150 align:middle line:90%
She passed over.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.882 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:30:13.882 --> 00:30:18.566 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she's right here, because
you carry your mother's energy.

00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Now this young
lady asked before,

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.990 align:middle line:84%
can you carry the
spirit's energy with you?

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:24.750 align:middle line:84%
No, but there is definitely
a sense sometimes,

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:84%
if we don't feel as if we've
fulfilled our soul's destiny

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
with our mother, or
father, or child,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.000 align:middle line:84%
we hold on sometimes
to some guilt.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We hold on sometimes to
some unfinished business.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And guess where it stays, kids?

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Right in the emotional centers.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the energy
here that I'm cleansing out

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is debris from mom, which I
will speak to her in a second.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:90%
She's pushy.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:90%
She's coming right behind me.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh boy, is she strong.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:90%
She's strong.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:90%
You chose her.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.876 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.876 --> 00:30:58.476 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:30:58.476 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now
one more thing.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, this should
feel pretty clean now.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:90%
You should feel much better.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very clean.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And kind
of back to yourself,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.030 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more balanced.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very balanced.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: One more thing.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.540 align:middle line:90%
I just went to the knees.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit of
a problem with the knees.

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So just, have you had any
trouble physical with knees?

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, tweekiness.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I'm just seeing,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.490 align:middle line:90%
folks, a little bit of debris.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Now again, this
would be something

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.680 align:middle line:90%
which is not from somebody else.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
This is just your own stuff here
that I'm just cleansing out.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:84%
But most of the debris
from other people

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.129 align:middle line:84%
that we got to be
very, very careful

00:31:30.129 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:90%
are the emotional centers.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.931 align:middle line:90%
That's the mainly thing.

00:31:33.931 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
have you stand up, Cheryl.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.595 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go like this,
which drops the energy back

00:31:38.595 --> 00:31:39.261 align:middle line:90%
to Mother Earth.

00:31:39.261 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
And honey, stand right there.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:42.962 align:middle line:90%
OK, my love.

00:31:42.962 --> 00:31:44.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, Cheryl, I'll have
you sit down again.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.341 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going
to bring through your mom

00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:90%
with a message for you.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.671 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Cheryl.

00:31:49.671 --> 00:31:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So since you still
have the microphone on,

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.110 align:middle line:90%
that will be great.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring through your
mom for you, if it's OK.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:90%
All right, sweetheart?

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.480 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let me
tell you, Cheryl, you

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.990 align:middle line:90%
look so much better now.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:90%
You feel better?

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel,
yeah, sparkly.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A little
bit younger and sparkly?

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sparkly,
joyful, younger.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Everybody
else in the audience,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.347 align:middle line:90%
do you feel a little different?

00:32:05.347 --> 00:32:07.799 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:09.465 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
that your mom is here

00:32:09.465 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and she's concerned
about your dad.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.980 align:middle line:90%
So there's a concern about him.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.967 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask if there
was something about him either

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.550 align:middle line:84%
going with-- living
with somebody else

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
or is there a
change in the living

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.998 align:middle line:84%
situation with your
father, please?

00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just a
simple yes or a no.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
tell you that she's,

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.920 align:middle line:84%
your mother is involved
with this transition

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:84%
situation, this
moving situation.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I know he can be very, very
stubborn sometimes about where

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.340 align:middle line:84%
he's staying and who
he's living with.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.416 align:middle line:84%
But your mom is
taking care of that.

00:32:36.416 --> 00:32:37.915 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you, mother's head

00:32:37.915 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
is affected before
she passes over.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.169 align:middle line:90%
She can't make decisions.

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:42.710 align:middle line:84%
She's-- I don't want
to say dementia,

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.960 align:middle line:84%
but I want to say it's a little
bit like her mind is not hers.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Make sense?

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you,
she's still the same.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:52.200 align:middle line:84%
She says, here, she said, I
haven't lost a thing over here.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.634 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I found
myself when I got here.

00:32:54.634 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.425 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She found
herself when she got there.

00:32:57.425 --> 00:33:02.217 align:middle line:84%
Now, would she have had, or does
she have, or had two sisters?

00:33:02.217 --> 00:33:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Three sisters.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Three sisters.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Is one living, two
over the other side,

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:90%
or are they all there?

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.762 align:middle line:90%
Two over there, one here.

00:33:09.762 --> 00:33:10.969 align:middle line:90%
Because she's talking about--

00:33:10.969 --> 00:33:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh yes, one
is, yes one is over there.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: One is over there.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:13.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So she has two sisters
remaining here.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's
talking about two sisters.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.011 align:middle line:90%
That's what I heard in my head.

00:33:18.011 --> 00:33:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So I got to tell you, and I'm
very much connected with them

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:90%
from the other side of life.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.807 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that,
like you said, you

00:33:26.807 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:90%
haven't been in touch with them.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.525 align:middle line:84%
I don't think she was
really in touch with them

00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:90%
when she was living here.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.033 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that
she's more in touch with them

00:33:33.033 --> 00:33:34.822 align:middle line:84%
now than she was
when she was living.

00:33:34.822 --> 00:33:36.405 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
a sewing machine.

00:33:36.405 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand
about that sewing machine?

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.051 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she says as
she comes close to me, she said,

00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.140 align:middle line:84%
she'll understand about
the sewing machine.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.865 align:middle line:84%
And I think she used to love
to use that sewing machine when

00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:90%
she was younger.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she used
to like to make dresses.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:84%
She used to make
clothes for the kids.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And she's telling me about that.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.634 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember a trunk
that was in the house?

00:33:55.634 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
know the trunk?

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that one

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.921 align:middle line:84%
time when you were a
little girl, she said,

00:33:59.921 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:90%
you hid in that trunk.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.905 align:middle line:84%
So when they come back, when
they come back to me, when

00:34:04.905 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:84%
the spirit comes
back, many times

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.440 align:middle line:84%
they come back in memories
that they had in the lifetime.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And she goes back, of course,
to a younger time with you,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.515 align:middle line:84%
when things were
happy and joyful.

00:34:15.515 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, for some reason,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:84%
she was talking about you
were hiding in that trunk.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't find you
when it was hide and seek.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.750 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
she's talking about.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.031 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:25.739 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:25.889 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Good, because it's
important that you

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:29.370 align:middle line:84%
remember it to
validate this, yes?

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you that
I feel with this lady

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:36.889 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily religious per
se, but I do feel spiritual.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.969 align:middle line:90%
I feel upliftment with your mom.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.989 align:middle line:90%
And I just got to tell you that.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking to me about
tithing or giving money.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.721 align:middle line:84%
And tithing was very
important to her.

00:34:46.721 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.907 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
because I feel like she

00:34:49.907 --> 00:34:52.294 align:middle line:84%
has to put money in the
envelope and give it in.

00:34:52.294 --> 00:34:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
that your mother really

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
feels like there's a
missionary spirit to her.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So I would not be surprised
in other lifetimes

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:84%
if she was indeed a
missionary in that way.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.305 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:35:06.305 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And I got to talk to
you about your dad,

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:84%
because she's going on now
again about your father.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.197 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there's been
either trouble with his foot.

00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.198 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:18.702 align:middle line:84%
Because he's got
to watch his foot.

00:35:18.702 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.492 align:middle line:84%
There were tests
taken, or X-rays.

00:35:21.492 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um-hum.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.648 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:23.648 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she's telling
me it's something either about,

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if he
has to use a cane

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.490 align:middle line:84%
or he needed help with
walking right after that.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:33.568 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that he should not be,

00:35:33.568 --> 00:35:36.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're concerned about the
hip, falling down, or something

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and falling down.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, he's
had two hip replacements.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's had
two hip replacements?

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.562 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:41.562 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Because your mom is concerned.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very honest of
what I bring through.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.414 align:middle line:84%
And my agreement with the spirit
world is if they give it to me,

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I have to give it out.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:50.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So I get very, very much
your mom saying to me,

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.739 align:middle line:84%
we've got to be careful about
him falling down, and a hip.

00:35:56.739 --> 00:35:57.905 align:middle line:90%
So she's talking about that.

00:35:57.905 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.748 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I know that I just

00:35:59.748 --> 00:36:02.320 align:middle line:90%
want to go where he's watched.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.450 align:middle line:90%
So he's got to be watched.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:04.219 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:04.219 --> 00:36:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who has
all the encyclopedias

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
or had the
encyclopedias, please?

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, when
we were growing up.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.451 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
weren't you the one

00:36:10.451 --> 00:36:12.426 align:middle line:84%
who really wanted to
get those encyclopedias.

00:36:12.426 --> 00:36:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you,
they were the Britannica

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.914 align:middle line:84%
encyclopedias, and it's the
ones where every month you

00:36:16.914 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:90%
get another one.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you remember that?

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she's
telling me about that.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.081 align:middle line:90%
And that you looked so forward.

00:36:22.081 --> 00:36:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And she said you'd go
out to the post box.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.325 align:middle line:84%
You'd go out to the mail
and make sure about that.

00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember this?

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:27.696 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:27.696 --> 00:36:29.446 align:middle line:84%

I love that that she
brings that through here,

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:90%
because it's very real.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Now she's dropping here a pearl.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.270 align:middle line:90%
And she's giving you a pearl.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's just a single pearl.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure that
it belonged to her

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.970 align:middle line:90%
or she had a-- she did.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you understand.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.410 align:middle line:84%
She said you understand
it-- you understand it.

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And would you know of anyone
named Betty, or Bessie,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
or with this name,
living on this side

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.085 align:middle line:90%
or in the spirit world, please?

00:36:57.085 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A friend of
hers when she was young.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:59.321 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A friend of hers?

00:36:59.321 --> 00:36:59.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that she's

Are you brothers in some way?

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Are you a friend, that you

OK.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Someone called up
a doctor or tried

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.557 align:middle line:84%

help for him.

00:37:33.557 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was
there a specialist

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:90%
he had to go to at one time?

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.704 align:middle line:84%
And didn't you bring him to
a specialist at one time?

00:37:42.704 --> 00:37:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.680 align:middle line:84%

was some kind of a
stroke at one point,

00:37:50.367 --> 00:37:51.450 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of something.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.942 align:middle line:84%
One part of the body I feel
like is not working correctly.

00:37:53.942 --> 00:37:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Who has dad's wallet?

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Who took dad's wallet?

00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Did you take dad's wallet?

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the wallet?

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I know
where it's at, yes.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.540 align:middle line:84%

>>VAN PRAAGH: You

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So it must be his
picture in his wallet.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:84%

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.070 align:middle line:84%

>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.055 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he
comes closer and closer.

00:38:15.055 --> 00:38:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that he keeps on giving
me the feeling that I either

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.200 align:middle line:84%
got to move him from
one room to another,

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.986 align:middle line:84%
or take him from one place
to another in the house.

00:38:23.986 --> 00:38:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's correct.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.460 align:middle line:90%

And I want to go to the back
area of the house as well.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:30.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go toward the
backyard or the back area.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for making

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:90%

says that you moved
that television

00:38:47.168 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:90%
set so I could see it.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking out
the window, and you

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.087 align:middle line:90%

I want to go to the East Coast?

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.664 align:middle line:84%
Was there some origin-- you

00:39:17.664 --> 00:39:20.122 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Why would anybody
want to go to the East Coast?

00:39:20.122 --> 00:39:20.930 align:middle line:84%

>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
want to go to that area.

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.825 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to
the East Coast here.

00:39:25.825 --> 00:39:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I
feel at home there.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's with him.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:28.956 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:28.956 --> 00:39:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I just want to

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.300 align:middle line:84%
He's so excited, but he's not
sure how to communicate this.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.510 align:middle line:90%
But I understand that.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.260 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.360 align:middle line:90%
You got to go there again.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:84%
He has a very funny
sense of humor,

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.670 align:middle line:84%
but he's kind of like,
has a dry sense of humor.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a dry wit.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I can't hear.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.719 align:middle line:84%
So he either had a problem
with hearing toward the end.

00:39:55.719 --> 00:39:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He did.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:90%

And he's met all his
friends over there.

He's met all his
comrades over there.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
He's with people, I think he
must've been a military guy.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And he met a lot of these
guys in the military there.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.028 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a booklet
that you have-- someone has,

00:40:07.028 --> 00:40:08.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the boys,
kids have-- that

shows a booklet of the
military of his corps

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.320 align:middle line:90%

>>VAN PRAAGH:
Whatever that means.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
it's a number on it.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.972 align:middle line:84%
And it's a group
of military people.

00:40:22.972 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.768 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that there

00:40:25.768 --> 00:40:29.394 align:middle line:84%
must be some kind
of, I don't know,

00:40:29.394 --> 00:40:31.060 align:middle line:84%
little medals,
medallions, or something.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.736 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:40:32.736 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Because he comes in
very proud about that.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know the
funeral or memorial

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.264 align:middle line:90%
service that was brought up.

00:40:38.264 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:90%
He said that was brought up.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And someone must have
read a letter-- a letter.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
that make sense to you?

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your dad would
have either had a commendations

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.450 align:middle line:84%
at one point in the military
or some kind of a commendation.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.785 align:middle line:90%
He's very proud of that.

00:40:51.785 --> 00:40:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it does.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about who in
the family either is a lawyer,

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.210 align:middle line:84%
or does legal work,
or doing something

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:84%
with the contracts-- like
right now, doing something

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.080 align:middle line:84%
with a contract--
working in something.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My younger
brother, Terry, is.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that your dad is
trying to help someone

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.030 align:middle line:90%
with a contract out.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that the
contract was made once,

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and they had to redo a contract
because something in the terms

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:84%
were not right or
something was not right.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's either
the period of time,

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.970 align:middle line:84%
or the number
amount, money amount,

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.220 align:middle line:90%
but something was not correct.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I know it is.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.572 align:middle line:90%
I just know it is.

00:41:26.572 --> 00:41:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this contract
will be a four-page contract.

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.340 align:middle line:90%
He shows me.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that I'm
helping him with this contract.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand this?

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great,
great, great, great, great.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.304 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that
someone in the kids

00:41:37.304 --> 00:41:39.595 align:middle line:84%
would have played basketball
when you were a young kid.

00:41:39.595 --> 00:41:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I did.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to talk about
the basketball or the basketball

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:90%
games.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And your dad's talking
to me about that.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.992 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:41:48.992 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Do you like horses,
or riding the horses?

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, I do.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
it's about the horses,

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.320 align:middle line:90%
all about the horses.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.134 align:middle line:84%
And I like to be in
horses-- with horses.

00:41:56.134 --> 00:41:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if you were gonna

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.230 align:middle line:84%
ride as far as I don't
know, for awards,

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:04.410 align:middle line:84%
or showing the horses off,
or something with horses.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.054 align:middle line:84%
But just, do you
love horses then?

00:42:06.054 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.011 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can I just, as
they come here close here,

00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:10.660 align:middle line:90%
I have his mother here as well.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.077 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
say hello to you.

00:42:12.077 --> 00:42:13.659 align:middle line:84%
I also get someone
in the spirit world

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:16.030 align:middle line:84%
with the name of M-A name,
like a Margaret, or Maggie,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.996 align:middle line:90%
or a M-A name.

00:42:16.996 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean Mary, something
like this, over there.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My Aunt Mary.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your Aunt
Mary is right over here.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.385 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you that
the family must be spread out.

00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:26.010 align:middle line:84%
They must be spread
out in the country,

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.676 align:middle line:84%
because it seems like they're in
different place in the country.

00:42:28.676 --> 00:42:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Are there three cities that
they're in, or two different?

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Great, great,
great, great, great.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:35.739 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I tried writing everything
down before I died.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Your dad tried writing
everything down before he died.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:40.905 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:42:40.905 --> 00:42:42.392 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:42.392 --> 00:42:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that it would've

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.184 align:middle line:84%
been on a legal--
yellow legal pad.

00:42:46.184 --> 00:42:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know you'd still

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.836 align:middle line:90%
have those notes somewhere.

00:42:49.836 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know you still have
some of his books somewhere.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I know he loves books.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.720 align:middle line:90%
And I know he loves to read.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.279 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that's
his whole thing-- reading.

00:42:58.279 --> 00:43:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And if I could just take him
and put him in a place, a chair,

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.014 align:middle line:90%
with a book, he's fine.

00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.388 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:43:03.388 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I also go to tell you,
early in his life, early on,

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:84%
this man tells he
used to love history,

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
studying about history, and
also about military wars.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
Napoleon wars and Civil War

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:90%
types of things.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.885 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
there's a book that he even

00:43:17.885 --> 00:43:20.154 align:middle line:84%
has his library collection
about the Civil War.

00:43:20.154 --> 00:43:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
remember-- got you.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, dad.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Now he's coming very clear.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I know that you would have found
books upon-- after his passing,

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:84%
you would have gone into
his library or his area

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:31.810 align:middle line:90%
where there were some books.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense to you?

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.346 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:33.346 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And if you
don't know now, please

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.920 align:middle line:84%
check because I know there
are some thick books there.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know one would
be on the Civil War.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.355 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:41.355 --> 00:43:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And I need to ask, who's
redoing a basement?

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.122 align:middle line:84%
Who's redoing-- do
you understand this?

00:43:46.122 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That would be me.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So it's
really coming for you.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that, yes,
he said you had

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.170 align:middle line:84%
trouble or issues with
lighting-- the lighting,

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:90%
put the lighting up.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:55.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.458 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you had
to either redo the lighting

00:43:57.458 --> 00:43:58.470 align:middle line:90%
or redo the wiring.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Lee helped
me put up the lights.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You helped put
the lighting up with him?

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Actually,
his partner did.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, your partner.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.310 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.714 align:middle line:84%
So his dad is coming
through here to thank you

00:44:07.714 --> 00:44:09.130 align:middle line:84%
about the thing
with the basement,

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:10.575 align:middle line:90%
helping out with the lighting.

00:44:10.575 --> 00:44:12.825 align:middle line:84%
And I think you must have
picked out some lights, too,

00:44:12.825 --> 00:44:13.170 align:middle line:90%
didn't you.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.295 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:44:14.295 --> 00:44:16.064 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.064 --> 00:44:17.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that he was aware of that

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and he's aware of
putting things together.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.020 align:middle line:84%
He said he puts in
his own two cents.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.745 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys get married?

00:44:25.745 --> 00:44:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We're going to.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love it.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.620 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about marriage.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Hold on, because
I'm going to cry.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:90%


00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.070 align:middle line:84%
He knows at one time he
tells me you were going to,

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and you couldn't, or
something stopped,

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:41.940 align:middle line:84%
or something--
weren't sure about it.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.082 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's a matter
of going to happen,

00:44:44.082 --> 00:44:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're just
starting to plan it.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.017 align:middle line:84%
We're just started figuring
things out just recently.

00:44:48.017 --> 00:44:49.350 align:middle line:90%
I would say with the past month.

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:49.635 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:49.635 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you understand
that, within the past month?

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.626 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:52.626 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
he's, I'm going to cry.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:84%
He said that he was
influencing you to do it.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:90%
He was influencing you to do it.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And you have his 100% blessing.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.302 align:middle line:90%
And you need to hear that.

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.080 align:middle line:90%
You need to hear that.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:07.746 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:07.746 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And coming
from him, I love that.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
think necessarily he

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
understood your life,
or the life, you know.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And he knows things
so much better now.

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And he feels like a fool for not
understanding things and seeing

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:23.390 align:middle line:84%
you for who you are and
for who everyone is.

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
he said that people

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:90%
make such a big deal of it.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And there are parts
of dad-- and I'm

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.230 align:middle line:84%
being very
compassionate when I say

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:84%
this-- I don't want
to say he was a bigot,

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.884 align:middle line:84%
but I want to say--
but I want to say

00:45:34.884 --> 00:45:36.175 align:middle line:90%
was a bit judgmental sometimes.

00:45:36.175 --> 00:45:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
just feel with him

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:84%
as if it's a little old
fashioned, his ways of thinking

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.078 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing.

00:45:42.078 --> 00:45:43.740 align:middle line:90%
But he knows so much better now.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
to be proud of.

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And love is love is love.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for taking care of my son.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you for that.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.389 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that the rings are

00:45:55.389 --> 00:45:56.930 align:middle line:84%
very special you're
going to make up.

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:58.471 align:middle line:84%
I know that recently
you were talking

00:45:58.471 --> 00:46:00.720 align:middle line:84%
about special kinds of
rings and the design.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And he's just
telling me that there

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.716 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of a special
design, intricate design,

00:46:03.716 --> 00:46:05.722 align:middle line:84%
that you were
looking at to make.

00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.346 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:07.346 --> 00:46:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that
must've been last week.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.150 align:middle line:90%
It was, wasn't it?

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.499 align:middle line:90%
Last week-- he said last week.

00:46:12.499 --> 00:46:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.929 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: James, their
mom just passed a month ago.

00:46:15.929 --> 00:46:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I wonder if--

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.386 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, mom
just passed a month ago.

00:46:18.386 --> 00:46:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Do we have her here?

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.770 align:middle line:90%
She's next to me.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And she's wearing the new dress.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.930 align:middle line:90%
She's wearing a new dress.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So I got to tell you,
she's wearing a new dress.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Why would that Margaret one be
attached to her, or the Mary?

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:30.118 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mary.

00:46:30.118 --> 00:46:31.312 align:middle line:90%
That was her older sister.

00:46:31.312 --> 00:46:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.349 align:middle line:84%
So she's attached to
her-- she comes with her.

00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Did she die in the night
time, middle of the night,

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.200 align:middle line:90%
like early morning, 5:30?

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mid-morning.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she's with him.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure she can
communicate here yet

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.830 align:middle line:84%
or whether she's
going to, because she

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:90%
has to project and all that.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But can I just say,
she missed him.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:52.999 align:middle line:90%
She missed him really badly.

00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And I feel there was a
connection between the two

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:55.550 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:57.315 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that
they're connected again.

00:46:57.315 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:59.026 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know that you must

00:46:59.026 --> 00:47:03.960 align:middle line:84%
have mother's handkerchiefs
and stuff like this from her

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.115 align:middle line:90%
that the family has still.

00:47:05.115 --> 00:47:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.753 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know still
obviously it's been very new,

00:47:07.753 --> 00:47:09.510 align:middle line:84%
but you're still
sorting through things.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's some--
this is very funny-- old table

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.022 align:middle line:84%
cloths, all these table
cloths she collected.

00:47:15.022 --> 00:47:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand this?

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she
loved her dinnerware.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And she loved the napkins.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.332 align:middle line:90%
And it's all cloth stuff.

00:47:20.332 --> 00:47:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand this?

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:22.298 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:22.298 --> 00:47:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And she definitely
knows you have that.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to
help you out with that.

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:27.670 align:middle line:84%
She's really going to looking
forward to this wedding.

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.544 align:middle line:84%
She's really all about
the wedding, you know.

00:47:29.544 --> 00:47:31.202 align:middle line:90%
She really, really is.

00:47:31.202 --> 00:47:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I understand that.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.326 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you
that your father's helping

00:47:34.326 --> 00:47:35.370 align:middle line:90%
her to communicate.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:37.095 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is really,
really interesting.

00:47:37.095 --> 00:47:38.845 align:middle line:84%
And I have a mother
over here in a second.

00:47:38.845 --> 00:47:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Hold on mom, mother over here.

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a spirit-- you
guys' energy is great.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The spirit sometimes,
two or three spirits

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.920 align:middle line:84%
come together and meld
a thought and send it.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So if your mom for instance, I
don't feel has a lot of energy

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:84%
here, your father will
overcompensate and bring

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.890 align:middle line:90%
in the same, meld the thought.

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:00.640 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you
were thinking of doing

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.000 align:middle line:84%
a remembrance for
those that passed over

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:90%
in your wedding ceremony.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.202 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you for that.

00:48:06.202 --> 00:48:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:07.826 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:07.826 --> 00:48:09.202 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that you

00:48:09.202 --> 00:48:11.660 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have something of
your dad's and your mom's to be

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.010 align:middle line:90%
part of that ceremony.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're going
to have some kind of a candle,

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're showing
me this candle thing.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a unity
candle or something.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you remember this?

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you're
getting help from the spirit

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:84%
side of life to have
this, connect this union.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.075 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I want to go
to Hawaii or I want to go--

00:48:29.075 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But they're talking about
you going to Hawaii.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.551 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We're going
to get married in Hawaii.

00:48:34.551 --> 00:48:36.963 align:middle line:90%


00:48:36.963 --> 00:48:37.713 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yay.

00:48:37.713 --> 00:48:41.710 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So I love that.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Whose glasses do you own?

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:46.164 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a pair
of someone's glasses?

00:48:46.164 --> 00:48:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Your dad's glasses that you
have a pair of, or your mom's?

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Not sure.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Didn't mom have
glasses at the end?

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
someone take them off her

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.285 align:middle line:90%
and put them on the night stand?

00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:54.951 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:54.951 --> 00:48:57.211 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I'm being show that.

00:48:57.211 --> 00:48:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you that
they're right around you.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:01.070 align:middle line:84%
They're easy to
communicate with.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:05.130 align:middle line:84%
As far as their energy,
there's not a lot of stuff.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Before we talked
about protection.

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.340 align:middle line:90%
We talked about debris.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:84%
There's not a lot of
stuff with these people.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And can I say to
you as a medium,

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working with
them, it's so much easier

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to work with people
who don't have stuff.

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.010 align:middle line:90%
They're easy to come through.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.910 align:middle line:90%
So God bless all of you.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There must be some kind
of a pocket watch also.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:23.630 align:middle line:84%
You must have some kind of a
pocket watch of your fathers.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
he wants me to tell

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.652 align:middle line:90%
you thank you for keeping that.

00:49:26.652 --> 00:49:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, all of you,
for honoring those things.

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And the figurines, and these
things, the statuary, you

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:32.010 align:middle line:90%
have that.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:32.405 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:49:32.405 --> 00:49:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I want to thank you

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.224 align:middle line:90%
for honoring that with them.

00:49:35.224 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to leave
you all with that.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And God bless you.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:39.786 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:39.786 --> 00:49:40.777 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.235 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't
it interesting.

00:49:42.235 --> 00:49:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So I had before a horse
that came through.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't recognize
it, but young lady, you did.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.250 align:middle line:90%
You said this was yours.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.969 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing up, please?

00:49:49.969 --> 00:49:51.260 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name, darling?

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Sue.

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Sue.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So was it a brown
and white horse?

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did it
have the white in the front

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.270 align:middle line:90%
right here?

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because and I don't
know about horses, I'm sorry.

00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But I know the
white and the brown.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.144 align:middle line:90%
And didn't you own this horse?

00:50:02.144 --> 00:50:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:04.185 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
didn't you used

00:50:04.185 --> 00:50:05.310 align:middle line:90%
to brush the horse as well?

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:05.976 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:05.976 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
you would have oftentimes might

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.854 align:middle line:90%
have tied up the tail.

00:50:09.854 --> 00:50:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: This is correct.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So again,
I don't know horses,

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:14.460 align:middle line:84%
but I'm being shown
this, and I got

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.810 align:middle line:90%
to give you what I'm shown with.

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:17.560 align:middle line:84%
There's like a ribbon or
something you tied it up with.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:17.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know if
I can say, it's a show horse.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
can I say that there

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.290 align:middle line:84%
are blue ribbons
and red ribbons?

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.989 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The ribbons
that this horse brings here.

00:50:26.989 --> 00:50:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's demonstrated to me
that-- animals are so great,

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:84%
because they come in so
unconditionally with love.

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And this horse is telling
me that the awards it's won,

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:42.620 align:middle line:84%
it's just that you won
the awards with the horse.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:43.842 align:middle line:90%
It was a combined effort.

00:50:43.842 --> 00:50:44.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.466 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:45.466 --> 00:50:48.036 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you
never over-taxed the horse.

00:50:48.036 --> 00:50:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Do not feel that you over-taxed
the horse, because you did not.

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:53.595 align:middle line:84%
I know that you wanted--
you must have tied up the

00:50:53.595 --> 00:50:55.220 align:middle line:84%
what do you call that
hair in the back?

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The mane.

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The mane.

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.100 align:middle line:84%
You must have tied that up,
like braided it or something.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Un-huh.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.056 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
there must be, yes, there's

00:51:01.056 --> 00:51:03.460 align:middle line:84%
a picture of the horse is
projecting in my mind, where

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.620 align:middle line:84%
you're standing right
beside the horse

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:90%
in the front of the horse.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.150 align:middle line:90%
You're like that.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And you have this.

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
that there would

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.190 align:middle line:84%
be pictures right
now you have out.

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.750 align:middle line:84%
That you actually
have photos out--

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --of the horse.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:14.695 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
you know about the blanket,

00:51:14.695 --> 00:51:16.330 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
blanket on the horse?

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: The horse was an
Appaloosa, so part of his color

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:20.130 align:middle line:90%
was considered a blanket.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that what
they called it, a blanket?

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.426 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:22.426 --> 00:51:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you that when the
horse or the end of the life

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.910 align:middle line:84%
of the horse, I know it's very
hard to put the horse down.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:32.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to
you about who's

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.699 align:middle line:84%
Franks, Francis, or
Frank, or Fran, Franc?

00:51:35.699 --> 00:51:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Francy?

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:37.781 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, who's that?

00:51:37.781 --> 00:51:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
my childhood friend.

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:41.055 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you speak
with her recently or were

00:51:41.055 --> 00:51:41.846 align:middle line:90%
you talking to her?

00:51:41.846 --> 00:51:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did something
come up about the horse?

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
the horse is here

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:52.560 align:middle line:90%
and give me something about her.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
not the same horse,

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:56.507 align:middle line:84%
but I had a horse that would
always lay down with her.

00:51:56.507 --> 00:51:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With Francy?

00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Just her.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:59.566 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else.

00:51:59.566 --> 00:52:01.895 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going to cry.

00:52:01.895 --> 00:52:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
one more thing here.

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So can I thank you
from that horse?

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure all
the other horses,

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but that one is the one
I want to thank you.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.454 align:middle line:84%
And I know you still have the
awards up on a wall somewhere.

00:52:14.454 --> 00:52:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.495 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
hold on-- where

00:52:16.495 --> 00:52:20.120 align:middle line:84%
is the one room that you just
by yourself in a TV room,

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.870 align:middle line:90%
or a sitting room, or some?

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
my meditation room.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:25.203 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, it's
your meditation room.

00:52:25.203 --> 00:52:27.060 align:middle line:84%
The horse comes
there all the time.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.830 align:middle line:84%
You must see it in the visions
when you're meditating.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:29.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:29.770 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:30.561 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my love.

00:52:30.561 --> 00:52:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
If I might, I just want to come
right back here to this lady,

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:37.530 align:middle line:84%
because I feel a mother
very, very strong.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing, darling?

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What is your name?

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.939 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Joany.

00:52:40.939 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Joany.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Joany, I have a
mother here for you.

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Joany, now why would
I say four people?

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.257 align:middle line:90%
Were there one of four?

00:52:48.257 --> 00:52:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Are there four kids?

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Four kids.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Because she's talking
about the four kids.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give
love to the four kids.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, mom comes in.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.370 align:middle line:84%
She's very excited
that you're here.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me you
almost didn't make it.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense to you?

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And did you see-- what?

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:06.057 align:middle line:84%
Your mother was with
you in the drive here.

00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Was she?

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She was with
you in the drive here.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And she said that she
was filling up your mind

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.072 align:middle line:90%
with the thought of herself.

00:53:12.072 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And that you sat in the car
and you thought of your mother.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:16.091 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:53:16.091 --> 00:53:17.881 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
what she's telling me.

00:53:17.881 --> 00:53:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So she said, I was
sitting right next to you.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I had to squeeze in, she said.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:23.050 align:middle line:90%
She had to squeeze in.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So there must have more
than just one person,

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.120 align:middle line:90%
or how many people?

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My
friend was with me.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:27.815 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Were
you the driver?

00:53:27.815 --> 00:53:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, I wasn't.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:29.946 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
were the driver,

00:53:29.946 --> 00:53:31.910 align:middle line:84%
because she was
squeezing in between you.

00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:33.590 align:middle line:90%
How funny.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is she telling
me this was unexpected?

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Was her death unexpected or was
there a surprise element to her

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.140 align:middle line:90%
passing over?

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.409 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was unexpected.

00:53:41.409 --> 00:53:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she
said it was unexpected.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what she
said-- unexpected.

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:45.748 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:53:45.748 --> 00:53:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I also want to ask
you who Carol is.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.095 align:middle line:90%
Who's Carol or Carolyn?

00:53:49.095 --> 00:53:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A cousin.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A cousin of yours.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Still living on
this side, right?

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I know that she's in
problems or trouble.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And the people over
here-- her mother

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:57.840 align:middle line:84%
must be on the other
side of the light

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.048 align:middle line:84%
as well, because her mother
is that other lady that's

00:54:00.048 --> 00:54:00.580 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that must
be your aunt or something.

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:03.569 align:middle line:90%
So she's coming in here.

00:54:03.569 --> 00:54:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, would you
please help Carol out?

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.600 align:middle line:90%
She needs some help.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's
emotional help that she needs,

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.340 align:middle line:90%
but she needs some help.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So would you look
into that, please?

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you please tell her

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that her mother
loves her and she's

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.330 align:middle line:84%
sorry she didn't express that
more when she was living.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:20.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to talk
also about the checkbook.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.310 align:middle line:84%
You must have made a
check out and you either

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:27.870 align:middle line:84%
had to delete the check, or
you put the wrong amount on,

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.640 align:middle line:84%
or something just recently
happened with a check and ta

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:90%
checkbook.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.922 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just made a
check to pay a Macy's bill.

00:54:32.922 --> 00:54:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Was that this
morning or yesterday?

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yesterday.

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm carrying it in my purse.

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Because she's telling me
about making that check out.

00:54:39.350 --> 00:54:40.099 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:54:40.099 --> 00:54:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you almost
put the wrong date on there.

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.305 align:middle line:84%
I have to look in
my purse now to see.

00:54:45.305 --> 00:54:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Look and see.

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll bet it's the wrong date.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.530 align:middle line:84%
She said there's something
wrong with the check

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:49.654 align:middle line:90%
that she was talking about.

00:54:49.654 --> 00:54:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And go on.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And did you just
recently-- she's going on

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.239 align:middle line:84%
about either stopping
a credit card

00:54:55.239 --> 00:54:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and putting a new credit card
in, but stopping the old credit

00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.635 align:middle line:84%
card or changing a
credit card over.

00:54:59.635 --> 00:55:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I canceled
one a while ago.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much,

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.190 align:middle line:84%
because she's telling
me about that.

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:90%
And she's happy about that.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you that she
has a very nice complexion,

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:10.750 align:middle line:90%
nice rosy cheeks, your mom.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And she's feeling very good.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I passed like that.

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, I go down.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.215 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I'm fine.

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
didn't feel it.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And she was out of the body.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Her father's with her.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you
that-- a father.

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And she hadn't seen
him for a long time.

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:28.300 align:middle line:90%
And she really missed him.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you,
there's a connection

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.010 align:middle line:90%
with her and her dad.

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.070 align:middle line:90%
She really missed him.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:32.480 align:middle line:90%
So I got to give you that.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you, do you
have two children yourself?

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.761 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have three.

00:55:35.761 --> 00:55:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have three children.

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.554 align:middle line:84%
Are there two that are close
to age, and then not one?

00:55:41.554 --> 00:55:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like two
years apart or something?

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Two
and a half years.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And is one of
them is going to college,

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:48.710 align:middle line:84%
or studying in university,
or starting to go?

00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, one
just went to a class.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A class.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you because
there is something coming up

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:55.253 align:middle line:84%
with your mom was
talking to me about,

00:55:55.253 --> 00:55:57.090 align:middle line:84%
one going to a
university or a school,

00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and that's not
going to be the end.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I take it back.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.070 align:middle line:90%
My son did go to school.

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.830 align:middle line:90%
He's in college.

00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:03.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.590 align:middle line:90%
He's taking classes.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:07.339 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:56:07.339 --> 00:56:08.880 align:middle line:84%
They know what
they're talking about.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.850 align:middle line:90%
The living people, forget it.

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:12.514 align:middle line:90%
The dead-- they got it.

00:56:12.514 --> 00:56:13.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm going blank.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you one more thing.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.994 align:middle line:84%
Your father-- and wasn't he
over there before your mom?

00:56:18.994 --> 00:56:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.743 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did he pass
away before your mother?

00:56:21.743 --> 00:56:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I know your father
comes to greet your mother.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, I gotta tell
you-- thank you.

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I understand what that means.

00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So I know the boy that
went to the university.

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So that would be your
son, going to school

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:35.370 align:middle line:90%
or going to university?

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Would you please ask
him if he just recently

00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:42.310 align:middle line:84%
was looking at a map,
geography, on the internet,

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:43.970 align:middle line:84%
or something about
geography and land.

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I have your mother, and
I do have your dad behind me

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.220 align:middle line:84%
now, telling me
about he's helping

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.347 align:middle line:90%
the boy in the university.

00:56:51.347 --> 00:56:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
been doing something

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:54.487 align:middle line:90%
about a foreign country.

00:56:54.487 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I'm going to
go visit a foreign country,

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:57.699 align:middle line:90%
or I'm looking at it.

00:56:57.699 --> 00:56:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But I know that he
was talking to you

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:01.255 align:middle line:84%
about that, now
wasn't he, darling?

00:57:01.255 --> 00:57:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I know
that they want

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to go somewhere, like
Tahiti or something.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.675 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure they were
looking at a maps.

00:57:05.675 --> 00:57:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you please ask

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.630 align:middle line:84%
if he was just
looking at the map?

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:08.421 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:57:08.421 --> 00:57:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: At
7:30 last night.

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.320 align:middle line:90%
That's specific.

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave it with that.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Thank you, my love.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:13.420 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.587 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.587 --> 00:57:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you
all very, very much.

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:20.250 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:20.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
there, the spirit's

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.298 align:middle line:84%
going to be there
for your wedding.

00:57:24.298 --> 00:57:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're all going to be there,
too, yes, with happy memories.

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And everyone at home remember
also to be very responsible

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:34.357 align:middle line:84%
every day, when you start
your day, to program your day.

00:57:34.357 --> 00:57:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're in the shower or
the bath, remember that energy

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and cleanse yourself, cleanse
that self, the body around you,

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:41.950 align:middle line:90%
the body inside you.

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And remember that you
need to program yourself

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:45.910 align:middle line:90%
before you start your day.

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:49.045 align:middle line:84%
I always program myself by
saying, "May God go before me

00:57:49.045 --> 00:57:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and show me the way.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.010 align:middle line:90%
God is love.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Love is God."

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're putting out
that vibration of love.

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And every single moment of
that day, you'll be in love.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:58.080 align:middle line:90%
So please, go ahead and do that.

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Until next time I see
you, thank you everyone.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.830 align:middle line:90%
And thank you all very much.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Good-bye.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:19.167 align:middle line:90%
