00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.127 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:27.835 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:32.776 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.222 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Hi everyone.

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:35.168 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:35.668 align:middle line:90%
Hey.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:36.894 align:middle line:90%
How are ya?

00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.988 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:39.821 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.905 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:42.905 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:90%
And thank you, everyone.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.214 align:middle line:84%
This is "Spirit Talk,"
where I take you

00:00:45.214 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.233 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you all
for being here today

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:90%
and joining us today.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thought in
today's show we'd

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
discuss something which
happens to all of us

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:90%
when we kick the bucket.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH] We all do die.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.510 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is no
such thing as death.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We are, first and
foremost, a spirit

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
encompassing this
body, this human body.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It really is the overcoat,
if you will, of our spirit.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And the spirit never dies.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The spirit just leaves the body
and goes on to another level.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So when people talk about
death, there really is no death.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The two biggest
illusions we have

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
in the three-dimensional
world-- number one

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.160 align:middle line:84%
is the sense that there's
death, which there is not.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:90%
You cannot kill energy.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Energy changes form.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.569 align:middle line:84%
And the other is a sense
of separativeness--

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're separate
from one another,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
when, in reality, we're all one.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:84%
We are well-connected
as that oneness--

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:90%
the oneness, the greatness.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe from my many,
many years of communicating

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:84%
with the spiritual realms
that when we first pass over

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of life,
we have an awareness, number

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
one, that we are, indeed,
alive-- very much alive.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
We're actually more alive out
of the body than in the body.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And spirit people refer
to us as the walking dead.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Is that funny?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:90%
The walking dead.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that,
in the human body,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
we're very, very concerned with
everything 9:00 to 5:00-- what

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
happens in front
of us, what's going

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
to happen with the
rest of the day, what's

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.014 align:middle line:84%
going to happen with
our money and family,

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
and where are we
going from here?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.394 align:middle line:84%
And we live kind of in a
fear-based kind of motivation.

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
tell you that when

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.935 align:middle line:84%
you leave the body, the
awareness that you have is,

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I no longer am heavied by
this body, no longer burdened

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%
by the body, and I'm so free.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I feel so incredibly alive.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was in
the confines of that body,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I felt like I wasn't alive.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And spirit people
often say that.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.106 align:middle line:84%
Spirit people often say that
you need to take time every once

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and a while and
focus on yourself,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.574 align:middle line:84%
be centered with yourself, and
connect with everybody else.

00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:84%
The second greatest
illusion there

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.519 align:middle line:84%
is a sense of
separativeness-- that we're

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
separate from one another
when, in reality, we're

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.572 align:middle line:90%
all connected.

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you pass over
to the spiritual realms,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
you have the
awareness that you are

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
part of that person,
that person, that person,

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
and that we're all
connected, like a thread.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
There's one big great
tapestry, and we're all

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:90%
connected to each other.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame we don't realize
that while we're still

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I think if we realized that,
that we were part of each other

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and that what we
think about someone,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
the words that are
expressed out of the mouth,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and these thoughts that we
have, the feelings that we have

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.994 align:middle line:84%
that we portray to
somebody else-- boy,

00:03:18.994 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
if we could only see
what we did and how

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:90%
it affected that person.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It's really not until
you go sometimes--

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.031 align:middle line:84%
if you're not spiritually
aware when you're

00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
walking in this human
body, unfortunately,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
it's when you pass
away, when you die.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And I say it's a little
bit too late-- you know?

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
A little bit too late.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you have that
awareness too late,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.049 align:middle line:84%
when you're not in the
human, that, oh, wow.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard it from many
spirits who I've talked to.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
"If only I knew then
what I know now,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I would have treated
people so differently.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I would have behaved
so differently.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
said those things."

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:84%
When you pass into
the spiritual realms,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
you see the power
that words have.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.237 align:middle line:84%
You see the world
you left behind.

00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things that
happens after you pass over

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is you have a life review where
you relive every single moment

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
you lived in the human body and
how your words, your thoughts

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
affected that person,
and that person,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.546 align:middle line:84%
and that person,
and that person.

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:13.711 align:middle line:84%
And in the spiritual realms,
you've got to look back

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and you have to try
to forgive yourself

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
for the power, the words, the
thoughts, the emotions you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
left behind with other people.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
What did you create
in the lifetime?

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
When you were given-- your
soul was given the opportunity

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
to walk upon the
Earth and to interact

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
with other human beings and
to share that aspect of love--

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:90%
it's an incredible opportunity.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible opportunity.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think it'd be much
more beneficial to have

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that realization when you're
still in the body-- the power

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that your words and
your thoughts have.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd be aware of
that, and the responsibility

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that you have of your
words, your thoughts,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
your interactions
with other people,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.163 align:middle line:84%
I think you'd behave
very, very differently.

00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that if tomorrow was
your last day on this Earth.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.219 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
How would you live
differently today?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.564 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I want to say,
tell people that you love them.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You tell
people you love them.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.065 align:middle line:90%
Very, very true.

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Spend
more time with them.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.351 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spend
more time with people--

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.571 align:middle line:84%
tell them you love them,
spend more time with them.

00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.392 align:middle line:90%
What about over here?

00:05:21.392 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Do
something in nature.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You'd be
more in nature, you said.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'd be riding
on a horse with my family.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.086 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You'd be riding
on a horse with your family.

00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'd
clear up conflict.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You'd
clear up conflict.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.829 align:middle line:84%
How many people
clear up conflict?

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That would be good.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.953 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:05:36.953 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you have that
awareness right

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:84%
now that you would
clear up conflict,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.882 align:middle line:90%
why wait till tomorrow?

00:05:44.882 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Why wait till tomorrow?

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you do that today?

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And why don't you be the bigger
person, the higher person?

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.964 align:middle line:84%
And you can teach others by
you being that higher person.

00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Change your reaction
and you get a different action.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Change
your reaction--

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.868 align:middle line:84%
she said change your
reaction because you

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:90%
get a different reaction.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:90%
Love that!

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Head of the class!

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
So it's being mindful.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We like to call this
"mindful"-- being mindful

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
of our thoughts, our
words, and our deeds.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
How are you treating
another individual?

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the Golden Rule.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Treat another person as
you want to be treated.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when it's
your time to pass over

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.684 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of life and
you look back at your life,

00:06:27.684 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
your life review,
you're going to see

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:90%
how you treated other people.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And people often ask
me, is there a Heaven

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and is there a Hell?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yes,
but not necessarily

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:90%
in the biblical traditions.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is really the
energy you've left behind.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
What did you create while
you were on this Earth?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Did you make
somebody's life easier?

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Did you demonstrate more
compassion, more love,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:90%
more forgiveness?

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Or was it really
kind of negative,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
where you tried-- you
put out negativity?

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:90%
You didn't forgive.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
You could have made someone's
life so much better,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
you could have taken
the higher road,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
but you chose to go down
to the lower levels.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Now that we're all here today
and you're watching this today,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:84%
please take away from
this just a reminder.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm here, honestly,
just to remind you

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:90%
that this is who you are.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You're a spirit having
this human experience.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just a sign
post in the road

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that you
are God in your own way.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:90%
You are all that.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
God is total creation, and
God-- and I don't want--

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
don't even use the
religious sense of God.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say you're
part of that creation--

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:90%
that incredible creation.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And to live up to that truth,
you have to live in alignment.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And really, you must
live in alignment

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.880 align:middle line:84%
with that truth, which is love,
which is demonstrating love.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's so interesting--
the universe will always

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:90%
give your tests.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Every day, we're
tested about love.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.592 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
have a difficult family?

00:07:54.592 --> 00:07:55.671 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mostly
everybody in the audience--

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure people at home.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:84%
It seems that, of course, that
biggest illusion, the sense

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
of being separate
from one another--

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:90%
that we are all connected.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.511 align:middle line:84%
And if you've come back
on this Earth level

00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
to learn from each other, you as
a soul group will teach-- well,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.400 align:middle line:84%
you'll come back and you'll
learn with your soul group.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So you'll mostly come
back with those members

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.722 align:middle line:90%
who will teach you the most.

00:08:16.722 --> 00:08:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And in most case, it's family.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And if there are
some family members--

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you can forgive
some family members

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
who create a certain situation.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.360 align:middle line:90%
You have to remember-- OK.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going to judgment,
which is fear-based,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
you've got to step
back and say, mm-hm.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
What lesson are they
teaching me about myself?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going to
jump in and judge,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm just as bad as they are.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.840 align:middle line:84%
So I often say to people-- you
know, they ask about karma.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:90%
What does karma mean?

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, how people treat
you is your karma.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
How you react is your karma.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really very true.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
being-- the many years

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing this work.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And it really is taking
a pause and stepping back

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if a
situation goes on,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
a certain scenario-- where
is that person coming from?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Our first reaction is to judge.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But judgement is
really fear-based.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But if we step back and look
at it with compassion-- OK.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:84%
What is this person
telling me, treating me?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:90%
What is their backstory?

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Huh?

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody you
meet has a backstory.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a history.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And what will come to the
surface, you have to remember,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.007 align:middle line:84%
is always a combination of
their backstory, their values,

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
what they've been taught,
what they haven't been taught.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It's right there
in front of you.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.135 align:middle line:84%
And instead of judging
someone, just step in

00:09:42.135 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:90%
and see what you can teach them.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:90%
How could you love them?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Treat them as you
want to be treated.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And really what it is-- it's
living a life of mindfulness,

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
being aware of what
you do to someone else,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:90%
what you say to somebody else.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And I always do
get by with that.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.274 align:middle line:84%
I always get by with a sense
of-- and I'm learning it, too.

00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every day
we're learning things.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.814 align:middle line:84%
In every situation,
we're learning something.

00:10:02.814 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But I really do my best
to be mindful at changing

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
the scenario, changing the
energy around a person,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:90%
around a situation.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:84%
If I want them to be as
happy as I can be-- and let's

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:84%
say they're depressed or they're
down or they're fear-based,

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might be,
if I go into that scenario

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and I'm on that path, I'm
on that path for a reason.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:90%
I know there are no accidents.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in accidents.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I know you don't
believe in accidents.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:90%
There are no accidents.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: None.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.965 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Divine
intervention, right?

00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I believe our
higher self, the creative self,

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
the God itself, is
leading us on this path

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.844 align:middle line:84%
we're meant to be because we're
interacting with another soul.

00:10:39.844 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn
something from them

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.830 align:middle line:84%
or teach them or learn
something together.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it's about.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So if there is a person
in your life that you,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
right now-- maybe you
were misinterpreted.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you showed judgment
where you shouldn't have.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's
somebody in the body,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's somebody
who left the body.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.875 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for a few seconds,
you can just think of them.

00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
You might just close your
eyes for a few seconds.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.937 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to envision a person.

00:11:08.937 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's in the
body or out of the body,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.320 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter,
because there is no death.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're either in the
body or out of the body.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are out
of the body, anyway.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
With just a thought,
we leave the body.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And just send them a
bit of forgiveness,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:84%
understanding--
maybe as an apology.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing is
as you're sending this out

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to them, I want you
to respect and to feel

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
the reaction that
your body gives you.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
When you give out forgiveness,
how does it make you feel?

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:90%
And just interpret that.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
We spend so little
time to forgive others,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.536 align:middle line:84%
when really that's many
times why we're down here.

00:11:56.536 --> 00:11:57.251 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.222 align:middle line:90%
And open your eyes.

00:11:59.222 --> 00:12:00.972 align:middle line:84%
Anybody want to share
a reaction that they

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
had when you sent
forgiveness to somebody?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Any reaction?

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You
just feel lighter.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You feel lighter.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.622 align:middle line:90%
How many people felt lighter?

00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And relief.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And relief.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Settled down.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A sense of peace.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.434 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Settled down.

00:12:12.434 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:90%
A sense of peace.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
How many people felt
lighter, a sense of peace?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.156 align:middle line:84%
And that was not even
five minutes we did that.

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if
we did a whole thing

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:90%
and it was going on like that?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I've developed some forgiveness
meditations, and on my website

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I have them.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Put yourself in that space.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It opens it up for healing-- not
only healing your relationship

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
with others, but, of
course, in healing yourself.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Because it all starts with self.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
When you can forgive yourself
and start, it really begins.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think, saying
that, we should

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
do a healing
meditation for self.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.991 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:12:44.991 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.553 align:middle line:90%
Let's do that.

00:12:46.553 --> 00:12:49.346 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do a healing
meditation for ourselves.

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:49.972 align:middle line:90%
Ahh.

00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you've never
meditated before, it's fine.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.720 align:middle line:84%
There's no right
way or wrong way.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a moment for you to be
just calmed down with yourselves

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:90%
and just come back to yourself.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.860 align:middle line:90%
So just close your eyes.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And people at home watching
this, just close your eyes.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And just listen to
the sound of my voice.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And listen to the
music behind it.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you are, first
and foremost, a spiritual being

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:90%
having this human experience.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And that you're actually being
here at this particular moment,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:84%
in this lifetime, on the Earth
at this particular moment,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.620 align:middle line:90%
it is meant to be.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
There are no accidents,
only divine intervention.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
We never know how one word, one
though, how we treat another,

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
the acts of kindness--
they really, really matter.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
They multiply in the ethers
in the spiritual realms.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And as you become mindful
of that physical human body,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
also send out a thought
of appreciation,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
a thought of gratitude for this
human body, this human system.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And thank that human body
for bringing you from one

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
place to another, for
letting you travel,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
for letting you
interact in life,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
for letting that human
body express life itself.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Every space you go,
you change that space

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.390 align:middle line:90%
with your own energy.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:84%
You leave an imprint of
yourself in every single space

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:90%
you enter.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.625 align:middle line:84%
At this moment, I would like
you to pay attention and focus

00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
your mind upon
your heart space--

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
that beautiful green light
at the heart, the seat

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, the seat
of your beingness.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
That heart space, that seed
that's tucked in that heart,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
has been around for eons
and eons and eons of time,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
whether on this planet or other
planets or other star systems.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
In that little tiny
space in the heart,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a microcosm
and a macrocosm.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.800 align:middle line:90%
It's all one.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.104 align:middle line:90%
It's your God self.

00:15:12.104 --> 00:15:12.895 align:middle line:90%
It's your creation.

00:15:12.895 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Be very, very mindful.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
That beautiful hearts
space, that green light,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
now expanding out
in front of you

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.835 align:middle line:90%
and around you and behind you.

00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And just try to imagine
that that beautiful heart

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
space encompasses
you, this human body,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head all
the way down to the bottom

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
of your feet, as if it's a
beautiful light, of cocoon

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:84%
light, a green, healing
light-- a cocoon of light,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.810 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual being you are.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And as you become
aware of that, just

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
receive waves of
information about yourself,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:90%
about your soul self.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You are a child of the
universe, and I just

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.400 align:middle line:84%
want you to imagine now
that your spirit steps out

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of that body and
stands in front of you,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
turns around, and
looks right at you.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And your brain
receives information

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
from that spirit body, that like
body, looking directly at you,

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:90%
standing in front of you now.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And begin to receive
transmissions.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Begin to receive thoughts,
feelings, from your light body,

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:90%
or spirit body to yourself.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.608 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.608 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
And listen.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.565 align:middle line:90%
Listen with your heart.

00:16:43.565 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of another
aspect of your being,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.965 align:middle line:84%
another aspect of yourself
which you hadn't seen before.

00:16:57.965 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you step into
that space, everything

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:90%
begins to lighten up.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Go back to a time in your
life when you were very, very

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:17.270 align:middle line:84%
young-- a child-- and
flashing before you,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
one scenario and
another scenario

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.169 align:middle line:84%
where people stepped
into your life,

00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it was your
parents or siblings,

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:90%
perhaps some childhood friends.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And just be mindful,
without judgment--

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:84%
being mindful of what they were
there to teach you as a spirit.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
What lessons did they come
upon your path to teach you,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and you them?

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself up
to teenage years,

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.563 align:middle line:84%
just being mindful of
these scenarios flashing

00:17:46.563 --> 00:17:47.391 align:middle line:90%
in front of you.

00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:90%
What did you decide?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Did you decide to
judge the information,

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.850 align:middle line:90%
criticize the information?

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Did you demonstrate love and
compassion, understanding?

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.935 align:middle line:90%
Bring yourself to your 20s.

00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps things have
changed a little bit,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
being more of an
understanding, being

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:15.001 align:middle line:84%
more aware because
you lived life longer.

00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:17.125 align:middle line:84%
How are the relationships
in your life in your 20s?

00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Where could you have
demonstrated more mindfulness

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.155 align:middle line:90%
in your 20s?

00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Then your 30s, perhaps.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Where you could present more
mindfulness, more caring,

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.400 align:middle line:84%
more understanding,
more compassion?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Not judging yourself, just
assessing-- assessing yourself,

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
assessing those moments in
your life, those lessons

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
in your life, those people
who came upon your path

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to teach you and remind
you of your brilliance,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of your greatness--
that you are,

00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
indeed, our God, you,
indeed, are spirit.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:90%
God always says yes.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:90%
The human says no.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Bringing yourself
to present day,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:90%
and just assessing, not judging.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Observing-- where
do you stand today?

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you choose to treat others
as you want to be treated?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
To be mindful of the words
that come out of your mouth,

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts that come
out of your head--

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you're creating every
single one of them.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.583 align:middle line:10%
When you leave
this Earth, do you

00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:10%
want to look back
at your life and be

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:35.575 align:middle line:10%
proud of what you
left or do you want

00:19:35.575 --> 00:19:39.060 align:middle line:10%
to be ashamed of what you left?

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.185 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to create?

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment, in
that lovely clarity,

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
we send, again,
forgiveness and love

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to those in the spirit world
and those in the living world.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And together, I would like
everybody at home and everybody

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
here in this audience to please
repeat these words out loud.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.115 align:middle line:84%
And let's change this
frequency and the vibration

00:20:05.115 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:90%
that we're sitting in.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Please repeat.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Healthy am I.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Healthy am I.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:90%

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Holy am I.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Holy am I.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And so it is.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And so it is.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.211 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And slowly open
up your eyes and be as one.

00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I love sharing that with
you, as you can tell.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot
of you received it.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:90%
And you went deep, very deep.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we could just
get some reactions,

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I think people at home, it would
help them, too, to interact.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.482 align:middle line:84%
So would you mind
if I came to you

00:20:54.482 --> 00:20:56.565 align:middle line:84%
and asked your reactions
of that whole meditation?

00:20:56.565 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.244 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
it's interesting

00:20:58.244 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle line:84%
when I do the meditation,
because before my start,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and I talk, and spirit comes
through and really speaks

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.440 align:middle line:84%
through me, and we then
go into the meditation,

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very aware--
and I'm sure many of you

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
are, as well-- of
the energy, and how

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.171 align:middle line:90%
there's a shifting sometimes.

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's so interesting.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Some audiences, they're
like, all over the place.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And then some are
very much together.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And with you guys, when
you first came here,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I felt you were pretty together.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But then after the meditation,
it really feels as one.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:90%
So I just experienced that.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And then when I see
the colors around you--

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.580 align:middle line:90%
I can see the auric field.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Which, the aura is the
electromagnetic field

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:90%
around every living thing.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And every thought you
have, every feeling,

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:84%
is really projected
into that auric field.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So when I first
start a meditation,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll notice there are kind
of dull colors, sometimes.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And the envelope is
so close to the body.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And then afterwards,
it's out here

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.779 align:middle line:84%
and brighter colors
and lighter colors.

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
is for forgiveness.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.986 align:middle line:84%
So I noticed that you
went through a lot

00:21:50.986 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of-- a lot of stuff
going on with you.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what you experienced.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Bill.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Bill.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And what
was your experience

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.174 align:middle line:90%
like with the medication?

00:21:58.174 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: As far
as the stages that we

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
were going through-- growing
up, the childhood years,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:90%
the teens, the 20s, et cetera.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Most of the stuff
that I felt that I made contact

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:84%
with, it was just petty little
things-- everyday interactions,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:90%
That kind of stuff.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Things that I maybe
said, and, uh--

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
things at the time

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that you thought
were very important?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And now, looking
back, petty little stuff?

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A lot of
it was ego stuff--

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ego stuff.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --stuff that was,
you know, coming from my ego.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what
basically came to me.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Interactions with
people where, you know,

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.725 align:middle line:84%
I was maybe being
controlling or projecting--

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
own stuff onto them?

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My own my stuff,
my own self-importance

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.678 align:middle line:90%
and judgment of them, you know?

00:22:45.678 --> 00:22:47.428 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's
really just wanting

00:22:47.428 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
to be validated many times.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, good.
thank you very much.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.586 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
could see it over your face,

00:22:53.586 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
sort of tearing, and I did see
the whole change happening.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.051 align:middle line:90%
Your auric field changed.

00:22:57.051 --> 00:22:57.855 align:middle line:90%
It got very bright.

00:22:57.855 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So when it
gets bright like that,

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:84%
what is-- how do
you interpret that?

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
really means you're

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
integrating, if you will,
you and your divine self--

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.521 align:middle line:90%
your true self.

00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
forgiving ourself,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
it washes away all that
stuff we're holding on

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.382 align:middle line:84%
to-- the old stuff, the
ego stuff in some respects.

00:23:13.382 --> 00:23:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When you
leave the physical body

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.757 align:middle line:84%
at time of death, the
ego, in many cases,

00:23:19.757 --> 00:23:20.840 align:middle line:90%
you see it for what it is.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And usually it's
just judgment stuff.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I shouldn't
have worried about that.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It didn't mean much.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.284 align:middle line:90%
It was just my ego.

00:23:26.284 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It was just my insecurities.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: How long
does that go on?

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It goes on for as
long as you want it to go on.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh huh.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So number
one, you become aware.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.636 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:23:34.636 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
The first step is
becoming aware,

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and you've done that-- the
intention, the intention.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Now you're aware of that.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully after
today you'll begin

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.282 align:middle line:84%
to be more mindful
of those thoughts.

00:23:45.282 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Treat another person as
you want to be treated.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's really how
it works-- The Golden Rule.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It is the Golden
Rule for a reason.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.005 align:middle line:84%
It's treating
another as you want

00:23:52.005 --> 00:23:53.770 align:middle line:84%
to be treated because
we're that person.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:90%
We're every single person.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:84%
We're every single person
here in this audience.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.634 align:middle line:84%
So just live by the
awareness that I'm

00:24:01.634 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
going to treat someone else
as I want to be treated.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.495 align:middle line:90%
Start with that.

00:24:04.495 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets kind of
weird and you get challenges,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.612 align:middle line:90%
you've got to try it harder.

00:24:09.612 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.085 align:middle line:90%
It comes back, doesn't it?

00:24:11.085 --> 00:24:11.274 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:24:11.274 --> 00:24:11.750 align:middle line:90%
It comes back.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Again and again.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else have an awareness
you want to talk about?

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.531 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you want to share with
us your awareness, yeah?

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:18.752 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:90%
My name is Liz.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi Liz.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to stand
up and share with us?

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.384 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:21.384 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.495 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Actually, I felt
like I was connecting to you

00:24:24.495 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
even before today just
because of what you just said.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I have never in my life used
the word cocooning ever.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I've never
used that word, cocooning.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
never used it.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.513 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Never.

00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:37.826 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And last night,
I was on a plane coming here,

00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and I had a lot of
problems going on with it.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And I sent a text to my
friend who lives here

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
in Denver saying, I haven't
spoken to you in a while

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.130 align:middle line:90%
because I've been cocooning.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And when I sent that text--
I can show you on my text.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I believe you.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I do believe you.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.609 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: When I sent that
text, I meant it in a way

00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:55.492 align:middle line:84%
that I was closing
myself up to the world

00:24:55.492 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going through
some difficult times.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Some
internal stuff.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.153 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I was
acting from a place of fear,

00:25:00.153 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety, and stress.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you had me cocooning--
now I'm going to cry.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Crying's good.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.753 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was like a
completely different definition

00:25:08.753 --> 00:25:12.750 align:middle line:84%
of the same word, cocooning,
where I felt engulfed in love.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lot more of a--
just a different kind of energy

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:84%
from the same word that, 24
hours ago-- 12 hours ago,

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:90%
was so restricting.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.700 align:middle line:90%
It was very enlightening.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:90%
So I thank you for that.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Maybe
because you're

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.757 align:middle line:84%
beginning to see yourself
from a different light.

00:25:26.757 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, at least
the experience that I'm going

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:90%
through from a different--

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:30.675 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A
different perspective.

00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: --perspective.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If you
step back and say,

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.170 align:middle line:90%
what is it teaching you?

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.545 align:middle line:84%
And instead of it
getting brought

00:25:34.545 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:84%
into the judgment and the fear
and, oh, what's happening here?

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the usual reaction
most people have,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:84%
instead of, what am
I learning from this?

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.570 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to handle this?

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:90%
And really have fun with it.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.349 align:middle line:84%
So you should never let
someone else's truth

00:25:47.349 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:90%
get involved in your own truth.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When you
make somebody else's power

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.279 align:middle line:84%
your power, you're
empowering them

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking away
from your own power.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And you will not be happy
until you empower yourself.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
thank you very much.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.497 align:middle line:84%
I'm really proud
of everyone here.

00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is definitely
something which

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
you can take home with you.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to come to
come to this lady right here.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you, here?

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a lady who
wants to speak to you.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ronnie.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ronnie,
would you mind standing?

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thanks, Ronnie.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I have a lady.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
She feels like a mother
figure to me, here.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.050 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to go with you here.

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure it's a
mother or a mother-in-law,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.653 align:middle line:84%
but it's really like
a mother feeling.

00:26:19.653 --> 00:26:21.012 align:middle line:90%
So motherly, OK?

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to get
more information for you,

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going to just
work with this lady who's

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:90%
coming in here.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:27.495 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:27.495 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.121 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know this
lady that I'm speaking to now

00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is talking about being in
your corner all the time.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that also she would
have been kind of a teacher--

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.950 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily the
literal sense of a teacher,

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:84%
but more of a spiritual
teacher for you.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Teaching you things.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.488 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you
that when you were

00:26:41.488 --> 00:26:44.740 align:middle line:84%
a young girl, the apple
of your father's eye--

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.754 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:26:46.754 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I need to let you know that.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I think this lady might be
connected to your father,

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.370 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not 100% sure.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Do you know someone that grew
up on a farm or near pastures

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.714 align:middle line:90%
or farmland, please?

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:56.421 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:56.421 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:90%
My-- my family.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.750 align:middle line:90%
My grandpa and grandma, both.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I would
know that this woman that's

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
coming through to me here
would know about a farm,

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.350 align:middle line:84%
would know about pastures,
would know about greenery.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
wouldn't you have

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.684 align:middle line:90%
known of her in the lifetime?

00:27:07.684 --> 00:27:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did
you have a sister that

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.271 align:middle line:84%
used to go see
her and visit her?

00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We both did.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's correct.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:84%
You and your sister used to
go to my house all the time.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you would
be at that kitchen table.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm very
much of a memory

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:90%
that this grandmother shows me.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And now we're at
the kitchen table.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm aware
also there might be

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.149 align:middle line:90%
a formal table in another room.

00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that there's a
little kitchenette table, too,

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:32.415 align:middle line:90%
or kitchen table.

00:27:32.415 --> 00:27:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.354 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I'm very aware, also,

00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that there's a tablecloth,
like-- um, what was it?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Plaid.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.670 align:middle line:90%
A plaid tablecloth.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Would you remember anything
about-- mm-hm, right--

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
her dishware that
she used to have?

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
would you remember

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.635 align:middle line:84%
that that dishware-- because
as this lady comes in to me,

00:27:48.635 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:84%
she shows me flowers
on the dishware.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.276 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was wheat.

00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wheat.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was brown--

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, brown stems.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --with brown
little wheat flowers.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Are you connected,
the two of you?

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Are you sisters or friends?

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Best
friends of 30 years.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:02.844 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Best friends?

00:28:02.844 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Connection?

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:90%
30 years.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
You're really connected.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.524 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're like
girlfriends, or together--

00:28:06.524 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
partners or something, here,
because I've got to tell you,

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:90%
you're together.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.620 align:middle line:84%
This lady here is
showing me-- go on.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.000 align:middle line:84%
She's very, very
sweet, this lady.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So this would be a
grandmother feeling.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:90%
A grandmother comes in.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you need to
let her know-- now what?--

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that she loves you,
she honors you.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.810 align:middle line:84%
She knows you more now than
she did when she was alive,

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
and she needs to
let you know that.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I also need to ask if there was
a storm cellar at that house.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um, yeah.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Outside.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The two doors?

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.206 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:28:37.206 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
And you'd go down.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yep.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:90%
And you'd open them this way.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.020 align:middle line:90%
You'd go down them.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Right on the farm.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she shows
me the concrete steps-- yes.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Being on a farm.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very aware the storms--
would you have a grandfather

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:90%
that you would know about?

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you know
if he would wash the car?

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
remember the memory

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.443 align:middle line:84%
of washing the car in that
driveway, near that house?

00:28:53.443 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was-- yeah.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.265 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And wouldn't you
help him sometimes, please?

00:28:57.265 --> 00:28:57.931 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:57.931 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:90%
It was a truck.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: An old truck.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.155 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
because I'm seeing it very, very

00:29:02.155 --> 00:29:03.340 align:middle line:90%
clearly in my mind's eye.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're both here
projecting an image to me.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So the spirits come in as
one, and they meld together

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:09.480 align:middle line:90%
a thought.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cry.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm showing you--

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You can cry,
because tears cleanse the soul.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we're
connecting with the spirit

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:90%
when this happens.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a healing not
only for you, but for them.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.695 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
that they want you

00:29:22.695 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to know that we are a part
of your life, and we accept,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge, want
you to know this.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And who's Suzanne or Susie?

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.137 align:middle line:90%
You know that name?

00:29:30.137 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, Suzanne.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.136 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Suzanne.

00:29:32.136 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, Susan, I want to
thank you from her grandma

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:90%
for being there for her.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Her grandmother is thanking
you for taking care of her.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And between the two of
you, who's the wild driver?

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.055 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She is the crazy.

00:29:47.055 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She is.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know what-- she
was telling me about something

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:90%
recently happened with driving.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, stop.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You've got to turn around.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Or something happened
recently with driving.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.203 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
went the wrong way

00:29:56.203 --> 00:29:57.602 align:middle line:90%
or you didn't listen to the GPS.

00:29:57.602 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Didn't
that just happen?

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yesterday.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I was going
to say, within two days.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.795 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:03.795 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good, good.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, right.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I saw her
mom-- her mom passed away,

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:90%
and I saw her.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You saw her mom.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that her
grandma wants to thank you.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.056 align:middle line:84%
And may I come to
you next, please?

00:30:14.056 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So we'll just go
around the line.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You can just pass
it over to her.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:90%
And your name is?

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Susan.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:20.783 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Susan.

00:30:20.783 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Did you used to get things from
your mother from the pharmacy,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.423 align:middle line:84%
and you used to go on runs
and buy things for her,

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:84%
get things for her and
bring them back to her?

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know before
she passed over, she was just--

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:90%
she's full of life, this lady.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:90%
She's full of life.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And I have her
grandma, and now I'm

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%
getting this lady over here.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And didn't your mother have
a brother on the other side?

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he's met her over there.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.070 align:middle line:90%
He's met her over there, OK?

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that family separations--

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:84%
so, that happens-- are
now bygones be bygones.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And I know in your family
that it would not only

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.550 align:middle line:84%
be from the spirit
side of life, but also

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.717 align:middle line:90%
right now in the Earth life.

00:30:58.717 --> 00:31:00.383 align:middle line:84%
So I know there'd be
family members that

00:31:00.383 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
are separated in some
way, that have not

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.730 align:middle line:84%
spoken to-- whether
it's siblings,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
or-- have not spoken to them,
your mother's telling me.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.655 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:07.857 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:07.857 --> 00:31:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Go on.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know that you said a
lot of prayers for your mother.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.961 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware as she comes in.

00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Would you have one of your
mother's paintings, please?

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.712 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had a friend
of my grandmother's painting.

00:31:18.712 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:90%
And isn't it worth some money?

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
feeling this in my head.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:90%
The painting's worth some money.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't cash it in, but
it's worth some money.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.685 align:middle line:84%
And it must have been recently,
you were looking at that

00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and had that thought-- hmm.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:32.188 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if that's
worth something.

00:31:32.188 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Not to sell it, but there must
have been a thought about that.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:35.706 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:35.706 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:90%
It's hanging in my cabin.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go over
here to this lady.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And your name is?

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Cindy.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cindy.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing, please?

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.923 align:middle line:90%
Because I have your father here.

00:31:43.923 --> 00:31:45.215 align:middle line:90%
I have a grandmother here also.

00:31:45.215 --> 00:31:47.756 align:middle line:84%
And I have a gentleman here that
would also be a grandfather,

00:31:47.756 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:90%
it feels like to me.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I need to let you

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.490 align:middle line:84%
know that your dad feels
very, very proud to me.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:90%
He's a very, very proud man.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you that
he's very-- he loves you very,

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.308 align:middle line:84%
very much, and I've
got to tell you

00:31:58.308 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
that, again, I feel like it's
his opportunity to give you

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.860 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness, and he
wants to say he's sorry.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why
he's saying it to me,

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.354 align:middle line:84%
but he needs to
express that to you.

00:32:07.354 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear him?

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.686 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:08.686 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
you've had conversations

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.960 align:middle line:84%
with this man, because I know,
in your head, you think of him.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And he stands right next
to you, and he sends you

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:90%
thoughts into your mind.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is how spirit
will communicate.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.680 align:middle line:90%
They project.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm very, very aware of
somebody doing water paint--

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.067 align:middle line:90%
watercolors.

00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:27.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My aunt.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
aunt did watercolors.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
did your aunt ever

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
teach you about
watercolors, or did she

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.957 align:middle line:90%
give you a painting of hers?

00:32:34.957 --> 00:32:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She did.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Several.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She did.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.053 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:32:37.053 --> 00:32:38.730 align:middle line:84%
I know that she'd be
here with your dad.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And she shows me
that watercolors.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's patience,
and she said joy.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.716 align:middle line:84%
She said to me, [SIGHS]
you have found more joy

00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:51.751 align:middle line:84%
in your life in the past
10 years than ever before.

00:32:51.751 --> 00:32:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.522 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:32:53.522 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
spirit world has

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.380 align:middle line:84%
helped you to find that joy,
and the joy is really inner joy.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can I just
say it started from inside?

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And just like the exercise
we were doing before

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
about the meditation
and becoming

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.340 align:middle line:84%
aware of who we are
as a self, a spirit,

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.764 align:middle line:90%
you have definitely done that.

00:33:10.764 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:12.846 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that when

00:33:12.846 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
you've done that, in
the past 10 years--

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.775 align:middle line:84%
and you are teaching
your father a lot.

00:33:17.775 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was
a stubborn man.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're teaching
your dad a lot from spirit.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.870 align:middle line:90%
You're teaching him a lot.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.874 align:middle line:84%
Was there a cane before he
passed over, do you know?

00:33:26.874 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:90%
There was.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
see the man with a cane.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And, um, no longer
needs that to walk.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting,
because he said, in some ways,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.290 align:middle line:90%
it was a crutch.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in
his way, he was not

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
taught in life to
demonstrate his feelings.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.307 align:middle line:90%
And he's sorry about that.

00:33:46.307 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But I know that
you've taught me much,

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.650 align:middle line:90%
he says-- many, many things.

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.044 align:middle line:84%
He's also-- and he comes
with that lady, the aunt.

00:33:52.044 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure who else it is.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.626 align:middle line:84%
There are two other ladies
that are around you right here.

00:33:55.626 --> 00:33:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And one is connected
with your father.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.741 align:middle line:90%
I don't know who it is.

00:33:58.741 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It might be a mom.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.219 align:middle line:90%
But I feel it could be.

00:34:01.219 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure about a ring
that you have that didn't fit?

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.734 align:middle line:84%
You must have had
a ring of hers?

00:34:08.734 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, OK.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Her wedding ring.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:11.955 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
the wedding ring.

00:34:11.955 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:90%
But at first it didn't fit.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We had to resize it.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a different size?

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.469 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had it
made into a necklace.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it didn't
fit your finger, she said.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.712 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:34:21.712 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there would
have one time been a hair

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:84%
comb, and the flowers on
the end of that hair comb

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.776 align:middle line:90%
like I just put in my hair.

00:34:30.776 --> 00:34:33.275 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That was probably
my grandmother's-- my maternal

00:34:33.275 --> 00:34:33.520 align:middle line:90%
grandmother's.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.228 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:34.228 --> 00:34:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember a
picture of that, or even

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.167 align:middle line:84%
having that comb with
the flowers on the edge?

00:34:38.167 --> 00:34:39.583 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- I don't
know what they

00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:41.337 align:middle line:84%
call them-- hair
combs or barrettes?

00:34:41.337 --> 00:34:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.385 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hair comb.

00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hair comb.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.219 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was a hair comb.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hair comb.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.843 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to tell you
that she comes in with that.

00:34:46.843 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the second lady.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.454 align:middle line:90%
Your mother is also here.

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:49.954 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you--
who had the heart condition,

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.389 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mom.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's the mom with
the heart condition.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm
just, uh, [SIGH].

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.345 align:middle line:90%
She's really funny.

00:34:58.345 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And when she trusts somebody,
she trusts them 100%.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because at first
she stepped on this stage,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.872 align:middle line:84%
and you said, you
didn't know who I was

00:35:04.872 --> 00:35:05.830 align:middle line:90%
or what this was about.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And she saw my
breathing-- [PANTING]

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.200 align:middle line:84%
because we're at high
altitude here in Denver.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:90%
And she's relating to me.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.384 align:middle line:84%
She needed oxygen,
too, she said.

00:35:13.384 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, I
need oxygen, she goes.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I understand it.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But the heart
palpitations she had--

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:90%
she had heart palpitations.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she
said, it took me over.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It took me over.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
wasn't really fearful.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.042 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't really fearful.

00:35:24.042 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, your mother
would give a piece

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.360 align:middle line:84%
of her mind, where
your father would not.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.961 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
father would kind of

00:35:27.961 --> 00:35:28.900 align:middle line:90%
step back in his own way.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.132 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:29.132 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know?

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
house is very important.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.954 align:middle line:84%
So the house-- the house they
lived in or the father's house,

00:35:34.954 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:90%
it was very important.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:36.865 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:36.865 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And would you also
know that there

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:42.120 align:middle line:84%
might have been somebody else
who had to live in that house,

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that they had to move in
upstairs or someone had

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.019 align:middle line:90%
to move into the house?

00:35:46.019 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I did, at
one point in my life.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You did.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:48.920 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I know about moving
into the house-- my house.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.470 align:middle line:90%
You moved into my house.

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:53.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that I want to
be careful of the kidneys.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.791 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It could be my
brother-in-law, who was just

00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.200 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with kidney cancer.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:01.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.751 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I'm very
aware of your mom and your dad

00:36:04.751 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:84%
together with the thought
about the kidneys,

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that they got to be
careful about the kidneys.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.560 align:middle line:90%
So, uh huh.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.141 align:middle line:84%
And did that person's father
pass over on the other side?

00:36:13.141 --> 00:36:13.807 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:13.807 --> 00:36:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.659 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, would
you give a message

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to the person that
has a kidney problem

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.344 align:middle line:84%
that his father is
over here watching him?

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to-- if you
can please be the medium.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:90%
You'll have to be the medium.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
would you please--

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.580 align:middle line:90%
that's what happens, right?

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.498 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
if you could just

00:36:28.498 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
pass on, because I know his
son needs to know that he's OK,

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and that his father is saying,
you need to take care of that.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.620 align:middle line:90%
It'll be OK.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't make these
horrible scenarios,

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.050 align:middle line:84%
these terrible
scenarios in your head.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But he
said please tell him.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.120 align:middle line:90%
So please, would you--

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's coming
from over here, on my far side.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.931 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:36:43.931 --> 00:36:46.921 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Um, I
think that, um-- go on.

00:36:46.921 --> 00:36:47.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.902 align:middle line:84%
Who had a puppy,
just got a puppy,

00:36:48.902 --> 00:36:50.360 align:middle line:84%
was thinking about
getting a puppy?

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.306 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:36:51.306 --> 00:36:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
just got the puppy.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.239 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just
adopted a puppy.

00:36:53.239 --> 00:36:54.071 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:36:54.071 --> 00:36:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Can I just thank you
from the spirit world

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.010 align:middle line:84%
about the puppy, which you just
rescued, that you just took in?

00:36:59.010 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I'm thanking you

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.980 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the
spirit around-- and I'm

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
going to cry now, because I'm
an animal person-- that you

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:84%
did the work--
you did good work.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Marks to the head of the class.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Because when you respect
another life like that,

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.580 align:middle line:90%
you really give that joy.

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:90%
So, I love you.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.904 align:middle line:90%
I love your energy.

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know you do
teach those in spirit.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I know your father's
very proud of you.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.216 align:middle line:84%
I know that your father
was a very private man

00:37:25.216 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:90%
in his lifetime.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.216 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a whole part
of him-- another country

00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I know that there was a very
secretive type of situation

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:90%
or scenario.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.864 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:37:33.864 --> 00:37:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.488 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:35.488 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know that part of his
life was in an envelope.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So he said find a manila
envelope and part of his life

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:90%
would be in there.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And, um, I've got
to tell you your father has no

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.455 align:middle line:90%
regrets about his past--

00:37:44.455 --> 00:37:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --as
far as his own life.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:90%
He made his own decisions.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And your mother is a lady who I
want to go out and party with.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.324 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a
great time with her.

00:37:52.324 --> 00:37:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to join you.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to
have a good time with her.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing,
and I'll move on here.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to go stitching or
ribbons or making something

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.750 align:middle line:90%
with your mom.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:02.762 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My mom used
to crochet a lot and--

00:38:02.762 --> 00:38:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm like this.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just want
to make these stitches.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I love that.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.980 align:middle line:90%
I like her.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.080 align:middle line:90%
She's go for it.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you need like,
strength, just ask your mom.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:90%
She's there.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
One more thing, then
I'm going to move on,

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.280 align:middle line:90%
because I have a lady over here.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.613 align:middle line:90%
But I'll ask you one more thing.

00:38:15.613 --> 00:38:17.265 align:middle line:84%
Who had the seashell
or seashells?

00:38:17.265 --> 00:38:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your grandmother.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:19.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And when you grew
up, do you remember listening--

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All the time.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --to the ocean.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:23.680 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she
would say, here you go.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the ocean
with the seashell.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.013 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she's
stepping right forward here,

00:38:29.013 --> 00:38:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and she wants to
give you her love.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- and she's
talking about her nails being

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:90%
nicely done.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:34.881 align:middle line:90%
Nice nails.

00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Funny.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.040 align:middle line:90%
It comes up.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And she talks about that
seashell in the ocean.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I get very, very
emotional from that.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And, um, I've just
got to tell you

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:90%
they're all so proud of you.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.660 align:middle line:90%
They're so proud of you.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, teaching-- you
could have taught growing up.

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:middle line:90%
You could have taught somebody.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.158 align:middle line:90%
You're a great teacher.

00:38:51.158 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:90%
You're a great healer.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:90%
You do have artistic ability.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Music is very high
as well, with you.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.777 align:middle line:84%
And, um, I just want to say I'm
honored to be here with you.

00:38:58.777 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.410 align:middle line:90%

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And it holds true.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.531 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:39:01.531 --> 00:39:02.447 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:02.447 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.910 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you, over here?

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.130 align:middle line:90%
This young lady over there?

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.765 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind?

00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:11.265 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Your mama passed over?

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Anita.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.473 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Anita?

00:39:15.473 --> 00:39:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
standing please, Anita?

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady-- two
ladies here, and I

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.780 align:middle line:84%
feel it could be a mom and
a mom, or mom and grandma.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.724 align:middle line:90%
Mom and her mother.

00:39:23.724 --> 00:39:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel your mom and her
mother does things together.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.480 align:middle line:90%
They do things together.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Would you know
anyone with the name

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:84%
of Angelina, Angela,
Angel-- something like this?

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.994 align:middle line:84%
A-N-G name at all-- a friend
of yours or a family member?

00:39:35.994 --> 00:39:36.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And who was that?

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My daughter-in-law.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
your daughter-in-law.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And weren't you recently
just talking with her,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.354 align:middle line:90%
talking to her, about her--

00:39:44.354 --> 00:39:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
were you with her?

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.632 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:39:46.632 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Where were you with her,
on the phone, or what?

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just texting.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You were texting.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.079 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:51.079 --> 00:39:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm very aware that
your mom is with you when you're

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
texting this Angel,
Angela person.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.121 align:middle line:90%
Is that her name, Angela?

00:39:58.121 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Angela, yes.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.195 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Angela.

00:39:59.195 --> 00:39:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.876 align:middle line:84%
And when was that you were
texting her-- last night,

00:40:01.876 --> 00:40:02.425 align:middle line:90%
this morning?

00:40:02.425 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Day
before yesterday.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Day before.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:90%
You're a lovely person.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.980 align:middle line:84%
You're a very,
very lovely person.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.276 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And your
mom wants to thank you.

00:40:09.276 --> 00:40:10.550 align:middle line:90%
I see a nurse now behind you.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.032 align:middle line:84%
So I see a nurse behind
you, which tells me

00:40:13.032 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:84%
that you could have been
into metaphysical work

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.114 align:middle line:84%
as far as healing work, or
doing something, wanting

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:19.610 align:middle line:84%
to do some healing work
yourself, or being healed,

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.681 align:middle line:84%
going through some
health situation.

00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:22.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Both.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Both.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:23.266 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:40:23.266 --> 00:40:23.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:84%
I know that you must
have not-- go on.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Let your mom come in.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Your mother is very
much, um, a part

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.500 align:middle line:90%
of the situation right now.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And she's trying to
talk in your space.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said you
react way too quickly.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.720 align:middle line:90%
You react way too quickly.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:84%
You jump into things
without thinking.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.224 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
a cancerous condition.

00:40:47.224 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My mother.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mother did.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Of the body, a
cancerous condition.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.296 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it could have been
in one situation, one place,

00:40:53.296 --> 00:40:54.390 align:middle line:90%
and then it spreads.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.102 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- I know whether
you're giving her herbs

00:40:57.102 --> 00:40:59.060 align:middle line:84%
or you try to tell her
a different way of doing

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.210 align:middle line:84%
some healing work or
alternative ways of healing,

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:84%
or you might have discussed
that with her at one time.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:05.475 align:middle line:90%
But she's talking about that.

00:41:05.475 --> 00:41:06.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
that make sense?

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All of the above.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does that make
sense to you, sweetheart?

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.165 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
remember that, right?

00:41:11.165 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So when spirits come
back and communicate,

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.026 align:middle line:90%
they communicate in memories.

00:41:15.026 --> 00:41:17.150 align:middle line:84%
They don't see us like we
see each other right now,

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:18.483 align:middle line:90%
because they're outside of time.

00:41:18.483 --> 00:41:20.030 align:middle line:90%
So they talk about old ways.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.534 align:middle line:84%
Now, I must-- I
must say-- go on.

00:41:22.534 --> 00:41:23.034 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:41:23.034 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Did she lose her
hair at one point?

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She was afraid she
was going to lose her hair.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She was afraid
she was going to lose her hair.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Because on about her hair, and--

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She had me
cut it all off because she

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
thought she was
going to lose it.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, she cut
it all off because-- OK.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:33.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.624 align:middle line:84%
Well, she said she has
a full head of hair.

00:41:36.624 --> 00:41:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She has
a full head of hair.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
tell you that-- go on.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.665 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:41:42.665 --> 00:41:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate the
view of the window.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:46.960 align:middle line:90%
The window.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you
changed something around,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:84%
where she was
looking out a window.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.265 align:middle line:84%
So it might have been in
the hospital bed or the bed

00:41:54.265 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:84%
she passed away in, but
I know that that's there.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I also want to ask
if there was someone

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.170 align:middle line:84%
who prayed to Saint
Mary or Blessed Mother

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.400 align:middle line:90%
or this sort of a thing?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It might have
been my mother-in-law.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
mother-in-law.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:05.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:06.696 align:middle line:90%
Did she pray to the Mother Mary?

00:42:06.696 --> 00:42:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She-- yes.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK so she must've
had them sing the "Ave Maria"

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.510 align:middle line:84%
or they must have sang the
"Ave Maria" at her funeral.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.175 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that I loved
hearing the "Ave Maria."

00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:18.675 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:42:18.675 --> 00:42:19.508 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:42:19.508 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the Blessed
Mary, the Virgin Mary,

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:84%
is really, really
important to this woman.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:28.265 align:middle line:84%
I know that there would
have been either a wake--

00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.473 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --for her, and I
know that there would have been

00:42:31.473 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
a lot of religious items
there, prayer cards .

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that-- if
you would remember,

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.990 align:middle line:90%
was she wearing a yellow dress?

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Would they put her in a
yellow dress in the coffin?

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.340 align:middle line:90%
A cream-colored yellow dress?

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:43.406 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:43.406 --> 00:42:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.286 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness, yes.

00:42:44.286 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because-- OK.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.530 align:middle line:90%
It's weird what they show me.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But she's coming
through with that,

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:90%
like a yellowish cream dress.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she's like,
looking down at the body,

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and she's just standing
over looking at it.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.931 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she thought they
had a lot more makeup on her

00:42:57.931 --> 00:42:59.054 align:middle line:90%
than they should have.

00:42:59.054 --> 00:42:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.761 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know--
she's telling me there

00:43:01.761 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
was a comment made
about the makeup on her

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.194 align:middle line:90%
and getting her hair right.

00:43:08.194 --> 00:43:08.901 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:08.901 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: As a
matter of fact, yes.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the little things
that the spirit is aware of

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and what they can talk about.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Now you think, why would
she talk about that?

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that could be something
that you would remember

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that made a significant
in-- into your head,

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.780 align:middle line:90%
that you remembered that.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I also got to tell
you that there

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:90%
was some talk-- she's going on.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And the mother-in-law's very
different than your mother,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:84%
by the way-- very
different personalities.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh yes.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.363 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I've got to tell you

00:43:34.363 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that they get along
fine now, but when

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.680 align:middle line:84%
they were on the Earth, we
don't really see eye-to-eye.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Would you know about-- and I
know about your mother-in-law,

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:84%
that you really took
heart in that situation.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:84%
You really kind of
took care of things.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.836 align:middle line:84%
And that is the situation I've
got to come here with you,

00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and I want to thank
you for doing that.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Your mother's off to the side
over here, which is fine.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
put her to the side,

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.826 align:middle line:84%
and your mother-in-law
wants to come in.

00:43:56.826 --> 00:43:59.577 align:middle line:84%
Would you tell your husband
hello for her, please?

00:43:59.577 --> 00:44:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Tell him-- yes.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Please do that, would you?

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.895 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And was there
jewelry that was-- someone

00:44:04.895 --> 00:44:06.890 align:middle line:84%
was wondering, should we
bury her with that jewelry

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.265 align:middle line:84%
or do you take the jewelry
off the body before you buried

00:44:09.265 --> 00:44:10.010 align:middle line:90%
it, please?

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:90%
She said you did.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I didn't do it.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Someone
did that in the family?

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:14.915 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: But, yes.

00:44:14.915 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They did.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:16.624 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:44:16.624 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.930 align:middle line:84%
That's just a validation
that that happened.

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:19.950 align:middle line:90%
So, that's it.

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you your mom.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
everything you did.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say, did you
kiss her on the forehead?

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.157 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:28.157 --> 00:44:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she
has that memory of that.

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So I leave you with her love
and your mother-in-law's love.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.346 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:34.346 --> 00:44:37.854 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.854 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, I have a
gentleman coming in here,

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.840 align:middle line:90%
and he feels like a father.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go right in this
neighborhood right over here.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.180 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Caitlin.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Christina.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, would
you mind standing?

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:48.404 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:44:48.404 --> 00:44:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And you understand about the
gentleman that's coming in?

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.295 align:middle line:84%
He sounds like a grandfather
or a father feeling.

00:44:54.295 --> 00:44:54.953 align:middle line:84%
Would it be in
your mother's side

00:44:54.953 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:84%
of the family or
your father's side?

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.102 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:57.102 --> 00:44:57.245 align:middle line:90%
Our mother's.

00:44:57.245 --> 00:44:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
mother's side.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:00.280 align:middle line:90%
And your mother's still living.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.483 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But she
would have had run-ins

00:45:02.483 --> 00:45:03.724 align:middle line:90%
sometimes with her father.

00:45:03.724 --> 00:45:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.919 align:middle line:84%
Do you know anybody
named Jimmy or Jim?

00:45:08.919 --> 00:45:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I think
that was his real name,

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.780 align:middle line:90%
her biological father.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.280 align:middle line:90%
But we--

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I get this
name, Jimbo or Jimmy.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
call me Jimbo Jim.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.367 align:middle line:90%
And I drink a little bit.

00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I drink a little bit--
I've got to tell you.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I drink a little bit.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I want to stand
away from, um, controversy

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and not get involved in stuff.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.962 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you two are
university, or university age.

00:45:29.962 --> 00:45:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah?

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:32.810 align:middle line:90%
And you're twins.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:33.477 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:45:33.477 --> 00:45:35.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you answer together.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Woo!

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And wasn't there-- this man
is coming with a lady here.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a grandma,
but I'm not sure.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
play with this.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.161 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you--
regarding your grandmother--

00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:46.910 align:middle line:90%
hold on right now.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:48.485 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.159 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:45:49.159 --> 00:45:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:53.805 align:middle line:84%
Do you two have to be the
mother to your mother right now?

00:45:53.805 --> 00:45:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.251 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:45:55.251 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.225 align:middle line:90%
Your mom is fine.

00:45:56.225 --> 00:45:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything is OK?

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:90%
She's-- yeah.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:58.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't know
if her coping skills are

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.300 align:middle line:84%
a little strange right now or
if she feels very stressed,

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.960 align:middle line:84%
but her father is
telling me that she's

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.140 align:middle line:90%
a little stressed right now.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:04.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:06.895 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you two are worried

00:46:06.895 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:84%
about separating for university
or separating like that.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:11.082 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:46:11.082 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And that just recently-- you
had that thought about that.

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he's telling me over here.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.075 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
would be-- got you.

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you have an uncle?

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a son?

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.154 align:middle line:90%
Does he have a son, this man?

00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Did you have an uncle?

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Did your mother have a brother?

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.340 align:middle line:90%
And still living, correct?

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:26.418 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:26.418 --> 00:46:30.492 align:middle line:84%
Would you find out if your uncle
owns one of this man's belts?

00:46:30.492 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.158 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He probably does.

00:46:33.158 --> 00:46:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Probably.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.211 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also seeing
now-- I'm seeing jeans,

00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:38.254 align:middle line:84%
like someone used to
wear jeans all the time.

00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Was out
wearing jeans all the time.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.649 align:middle line:84%
So it might be him wearing
jeans all the time.

00:46:42.649 --> 00:46:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And he really doesn't give
a hoot about anything,

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:45.770 align:middle line:90%
he's just himself.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:46.436 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:48.512 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep, that's Papa.

00:46:48.512 --> 00:46:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.678 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't give a
hoot-- and that's

00:46:50.678 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:90%
the word he would use, hoot.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know the big city
was a big deal for you.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.140 align:middle line:90%
What does the 17th mean to you?

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:58.995 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's our birthday.

00:46:58.995 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Birthday.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:46:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Birthday?

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:00.344 align:middle line:90%
December?

00:47:00.344 --> 00:47:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.926 align:middle line:84%
And did you go to the
city, or was there

00:47:03.926 --> 00:47:06.050 align:middle line:84%
a trip to a city around
your birthday time?

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.175 align:middle line:84%
Was there a big trip to a
city, he's talking about.

00:47:08.175 --> 00:47:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh, went to
LA for school this year.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: This year?

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're done now
because it's summertime.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.386 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:14.386 --> 00:47:16.114 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are
you going back again?

00:47:16.114 --> 00:47:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not to that one.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to school with her.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Where are
you going to school?

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.336 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Earlham College.

00:47:21.336 --> 00:47:22.994 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Indiana.

00:47:22.994 --> 00:47:24.285 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love these two.

00:47:24.285 --> 00:47:25.677 align:middle line:84%
Can we just talk
about soulmates?

00:47:25.677 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:90%
And you obviously are soulmates.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:27.926 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I hope so.

00:47:27.926 --> 00:47:30.615 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you really
are very, very well-connected.

00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you that the
man that comes through-- he

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.620 align:middle line:84%
wants to give a
message to your mother.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I know this man
that comes through-- he

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.550 align:middle line:84%
doesn't say he was
always there for her.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you that.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, he didn't show
his feeling very well.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And he liked to be by myself.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think he'd be in his
own little room or a part

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:47.090 align:middle line:84%
of the garage, or he'd liked
to be in his own little space.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:47.985 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:47:47.985 --> 00:47:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In the
living room, yeah.

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The living room.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted to be
in his own space.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.280 align:middle line:90%
I want to be in my own chair.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.717 align:middle line:90%
And that was his chair?

00:47:53.717 --> 00:47:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my god.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:57.240 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want
anybody on that chair.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
was his chair.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Get off my chair!

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Get off it.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's how he's sounding.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Get off my chair!

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:03.320 align:middle line:90%
That's how he would be, you see?

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.872 align:middle line:84%
And I know that-- ahh,
like that expression.

00:48:05.872 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
He says, ahh, and he'd
use his hands like this.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you that I
don't know if he didn't attend

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.020 align:middle line:84%
one of his kid's
weddings where there

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.610 align:middle line:90%
was a problem with the wedding.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
there was a problem

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:16.685 align:middle line:90%
with the wedding recently, yes.

00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:17.393 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:48:17.393 --> 00:48:18.884 align:middle line:84%
So he's just telling
me about that.

00:48:18.884 --> 00:48:20.800 align:middle line:84%
He was aware of the
problem about the wedding.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And somebody didn't get
to the wedding or someone

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.571 align:middle line:90%
couldn't make the wedding, or--

00:48:23.571 --> 00:48:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Someone wasn't allowed
to attend the wedding.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Someone wasn't
allowed to attend the wedding.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's
understanding these things now.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.690 align:middle line:90%
He said, what?

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:33.425 align:middle line:84%
Putting your troubles
in a round tin box.

00:48:33.425 --> 00:48:34.550 align:middle line:90%
He just told me about that.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.730 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me that
somebody has a box

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and they put
their-- interesting.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Keepsakes in a box
with a ribbon on it.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So would you find out--
if that's not you guys--

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's our mom.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's your mom.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:51.668 align:middle line:84%
So would you find out--
because he's telling me

00:48:51.668 --> 00:48:54.700 align:middle line:84%
about the box with the
ribbon, and it's keepsakes.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said a photograph
of him is in that box.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have to find
out if he knows that.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:02.287 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:02.287 --> 00:49:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And do you know if
there was a Charles

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:04.920 align:middle line:90%
in the family, or a Chuck?

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Charlie.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Who's Charlie?

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Who was that?

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He's our uncle,
and Chuck is the name of--

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Papa.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
Chuck is the name

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of Papa, this man
that I'm talking to.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:13.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a validation that
it's him that I'm talking to.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.509 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that he can

00:49:18.509 --> 00:49:20.680 align:middle line:84%
have a little swig if he
wants to, on his own--

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.980 align:middle line:84%
a little swig of
whisky or something.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.465 align:middle line:90%
He wants it on his own.

00:49:24.465 --> 00:49:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All the time.

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.455 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:49:25.455 --> 00:49:26.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Papa.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's great.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:28.530 align:middle line:84%
That was just his
personality coming through,

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.154 align:middle line:84%
and to show you that
this is who it is.

00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And, um, he's really
proud of you kids.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say he's
really proud of you.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry I couldn't
give you the money

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:90%
like I could have.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.609 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had more money to give
you, or more financial help.

00:49:41.609 --> 00:49:43.900 align:middle line:84%
He really wished he could
give you more financial help.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But, um, I've got to
tell you I do feel--

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I get very emotional--
that in World War II,

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.700 align:middle line:84%
or there was a war
this man was a part of.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he saw some
people die in that war.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he said to
me, I never got over that.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.830 align:middle line:84%
He never got over that,
seeing some death around him.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:00.820 align:middle line:90%
He never got over it.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't talk to
people about it a lot.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.560 align:middle line:84%
But I know that part of
that drinking a little bit

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.160 align:middle line:90%
was because of that.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.613 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's so sensitive.

00:50:09.613 --> 00:50:11.662 align:middle line:84%
Now, would you remember
playing Monopoly?

00:50:11.662 --> 00:50:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh my gosh.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.872 align:middle line:90%
A family trad-- yes.

00:50:15.872 --> 00:50:17.078 align:middle line:90%
I hate that game.

00:50:17.078 --> 00:50:19.578 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But you remember
the Monopoly game, the board.

00:50:19.578 --> 00:50:21.577 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you'd
play at the household,

00:50:21.577 --> 00:50:22.924 align:middle line:90%
and it would drive him crazy--

00:50:22.924 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It did.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.022 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was downstairs.

00:50:27.022 --> 00:50:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.229 align:middle line:84%
Drive him crazy, and then he'd
be off-- you'd be in acorner.

00:50:30.229 --> 00:50:30.905 align:middle line:90%
And, ahh.

00:50:30.905 --> 00:50:32.900 align:middle line:90%
I get very emotional here.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.020 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.790 align:middle line:90%
You're allowed to say that?

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:35.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So-- he's allowed to say that.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a grandmother
in spirit with him?

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is your
grandmother with him?

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:90%
His wife?

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No?

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Who's the lady over there,
the other side of the family

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:43.315 align:middle line:90%
grandma?

00:50:43.315 --> 00:50:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Our dad's grandma.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
there's a grandma

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:84%
from-- wants to say
hello to you guys.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.400 align:middle line:90%
And she's all dolled up.

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.661 align:middle line:90%
She's very pretty.

00:50:49.661 --> 00:50:50.160 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.785 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't come to
an event like this

00:50:51.785 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:84%
without being prettified,
without being gussied up.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And she looks very pretty.

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.520 align:middle line:90%
And I've got to say that to you.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.320 align:middle line:90%
She's honored to be here.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.333 align:middle line:84%
And you guys will have
children of your own one day.

00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:04.333 align:middle line:90%
You know that, you know?

00:51:04.333 --> 00:51:05.275 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:51:05.275 --> 00:51:05.591 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sorry!

00:51:05.591 --> 00:51:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Sorry!

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.135 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're going to
have children of your own one

00:51:07.135 --> 00:51:07.710 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.810 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell
you something--

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.380 align:middle line:84%
it's really funny between you
two, because you both have

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to approve each other's
partners, and this sort

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do.

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because like-- ooh.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Got to what?

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.482 align:middle line:90%
And be aware of Las Vegas.

00:51:21.482 --> 00:51:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I know there was
wanting to go to Las Vegas,

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.172 align:middle line:84%
so I guess when you
were in LA or now,

00:51:25.172 --> 00:51:26.630 align:middle line:84%
there was talk
about going to Vegas

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:27.930 align:middle line:84%
or having a thought
about Las Vegas.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:28.805 align:middle line:90%
Would you understand?

00:51:28.805 --> 00:51:29.949 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.949 --> 00:51:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She wants
to live in Las Vegas.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:34.031 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I wanted to
go to school in Las Vegas.

00:51:34.031 --> 00:51:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, you
wanted to go to Las Vegas.

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:39.474 align:middle line:84%
And didn't you go there for
visit and have fun yet there?

00:51:39.474 --> 00:51:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, not yet, no.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We drove
through the-- yes.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:41.636 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:41.636 --> 00:51:42.215 align:middle line:90%
On our way here.

00:51:42.215 --> 00:51:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But isn't there
something-- because I'm

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:45.790 align:middle line:84%
getting this other
grandma talking about,

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and you know, you tell them
Las Vegas will be coming in

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
go and have fun.

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to have crazy fun.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You girls don't
do crazy fun, which is great.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.692 align:middle line:90%
But you will.

00:51:54.692 --> 00:51:56.024 align:middle line:90%
You're going to go to Las Vegas.

00:51:56.024 --> 00:51:58.260 align:middle line:84%
She's promising you that,
which is very interesting.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thanks, Grandma.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.119 align:middle line:90%
Grandma, I love you.

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because in a
way, she couldn't live life.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.230 align:middle line:84%
In a way, she was--
she couldn't live life.

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:09.470 align:middle line:84%
She was like, she was
in a box and her life

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:10.640 align:middle line:90%
was predescribed for her.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.291 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to
live through you girls.

00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:15.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And she wants me to
tell you that she's

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:18.500 align:middle line:90%
going to live through you girls.

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It goes to show you there is no
death, and that she's living.

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:22.685 align:middle line:84%
She's so funny,
because she said,

00:52:22.685 --> 00:52:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm living through you guys.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.662 align:middle line:90%
And spirit can do that.

00:52:25.662 --> 00:52:27.120 align:middle line:84%
They can live
through your essence,

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.244 align:middle line:90%
and they can be around you.

00:52:28.244 --> 00:52:29.310 align:middle line:90%
And she's guiding you.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you one thing.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.197 align:middle line:84%
When you go to Vegas,
which you will do,

00:52:34.197 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:84%
because she's going
to make it happen,

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.130 align:middle line:84%
just be mindful of the
signs you receive from her.

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because you don't
even have to look for them,

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
get signs and she's

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:42.500 align:middle line:90%
going to influence you.

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're two really,
really good girls.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.480 align:middle line:90%
You really are.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.630 align:middle line:90%
You're wonderful.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:48.119 align:middle line:90%
You have great energy.

00:52:48.119 --> 00:52:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting that
you're here in this show

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.010 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about
thoughts and mindfulness,

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:53.690 align:middle line:84%
