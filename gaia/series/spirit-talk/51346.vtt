>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.902 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:40.133 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.915 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also
for joining us today

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
on another episode of Spirit
Talk, where I take you

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So today, we're going to
talk about psychic ability,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
psychic, psychic
ability, knowingness.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
think you're psychic?

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And why didn't you
guys raise your hand?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the truth is,
everybody is psychic.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is born with
what's called intuition.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And intuition means
into the soul.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:90%
It's the language of the soul.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're all born
with it, because it's

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:90%
kind of our survival technique.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
We need this in order to
survive and to live life.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is really our--
we're born with it.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a sixth sense.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And we all have it.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.282 align:middle line:90%
We all possess a sixth sense.

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:23.150 align:middle line:84%
How many people
here, for instance,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
have thought about someone, five
minutes later, the phone rings,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.615 align:middle line:84%
and it's the person
you were thinking of?

00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:27.594 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And you at home?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.404 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Or something you had in your
mind, a vision that happened,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.604 align:middle line:84%
or a scenario
playing in my mind,

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, the
next day, it happens.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Those people, yes.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
There are all different
types of intuition

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and how you use your intuition.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can develop
your intuition.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is psychic
from a degree or another.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
There are some souls who
come into this world who

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
have maybe a little
bit more sensitivity

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.150 align:middle line:84%
than most and like
myself, who are empaths.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:90%
We're empaths.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:90%
We pick up energy.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:90%
We feel things.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But every single
person can certainly

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
develop their psychic,
their intuition ability.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm going to
show you a technique which

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
you can use to further
develop this psychic ability.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think once you do this
and you become aware of this,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
you will be amazed at
yourself and amazed

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:90%
at the possibilities, yes.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, children are
very, very psychic.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.467 align:middle line:90%
And we know that.

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
children are very psychic

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is because they've just
come for the spirit world.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:90%
And they're very, very open.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And in their mindset, they
feel more, they see things,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
they know things.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And a child has not learned
yet how to be judgmental,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
how to put things
into categories.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.094 align:middle line:84%
They're really just open to
whatever is going to happen.

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:38.885 align:middle line:84%
They'll always tell
you the truth, a child.

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.830 align:middle line:84%
They'll always tell
you exactly the truth.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I think around the
age of seven or eight,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
they learned then to be
a little bit judgmental.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Or they say certain
things that they

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
think the parents want to
hear or something like that.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.047 align:middle line:90%
So it makes sense, doesn't it?

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I know there are a lot of
people here who have children.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a lot of you.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you can probably
relate to that, yes.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.212 align:middle line:90%
Any questions before we start?

00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:02.545 align:middle line:90%
Young lady, you have a question.

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
you mind standing up?

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Would that be OK, sweetheart?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
request-- what's your name?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Carol.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.735 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Carol.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Nice to meet you

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Nice to meet you.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.435 align:middle line:90%
What question would you ask?

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:12.059 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So James,
how long have you

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.767 align:middle line:84%
been able to communicate
with the dead?

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How long
have I been a medium?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A medium--
ever since I was alive.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.976 align:middle line:90%
Bum, bum, bum.

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:24.659 align:middle line:84%
So as I just spoke about, as a
child, I was very, very open.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to see
spirit around people.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I was able to colors
around people,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:84%
now we know as the
aura, the aura colors.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to know of things
before they would happen--

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
so very, very psychic
and very mediumistic,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
which are two very distinctly
different things, yeah?

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Psychic ability
is a knowingness.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:90%
We all have a knowingness, yes?

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And the mediumship is you
have to first be very psychic,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
have a very strong foundation
of the psychic ability.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But then you also,
if you will, reach up

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level
of energy, and be

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
able to be the interface
between the higher

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
energies of the spirit world and
the lower of the earth world.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little bit different.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.546 align:middle line:84%
So you have the psychic, and
then you have the mediumship.

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So ever since I
remember, actually.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:90%
But I will tell you something.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.711 align:middle line:84%
I also developed it
further and further.

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I sat for many,
many years in what's

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.543 align:middle line:84%
called a development circle,
which everybody can sit in.

00:04:09.543 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:84%
A development circle, it's
like a meditation circle.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.209 align:middle line:84%
And you really work
with bringing up

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the energy systems,
the energy centers opening up,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.894 align:middle line:84%
how to develop, and
really, how to then discern

00:04:18.894 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
what the different energies that
might come through around you,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.644 align:middle line:84%
that are around you, the
person that you're working

00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:25.457 align:middle line:84%
with in the physical
body, soul reading,

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
being able to read their soul,
and picking up on the energies.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
That's something--
everybody can indeed

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%
sit in a development circle.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.199 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you
yourself are very psychic.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.722 align:middle line:84%
I think that you've
shut it down, yes?

00:04:37.722 --> 00:04:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I think when
you were young girl,

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.915 align:middle line:84%
you used to be very, very
in tune, very, very psychic,

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:90%
very connected.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- I
don't know if it was

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.426 align:middle line:90%
your mother who stopped you.

00:04:44.426 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Or you saw things
that would happen.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.794 align:middle line:90%
But it stops, you know.

00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:90%
You shut it off.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A lot of us do.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A lot of us do.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.446 align:middle line:90%
A lot of us are all empaths.

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:54.790 align:middle line:90%
We're empathetic.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So as empaths, we
pick up things.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know how to
really ground ourselves.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And we think the bad things
are really going to happen

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and the good things.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And we really don't know how
to moderate these things--

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.555 align:middle line:90%
modulation I should say.

00:05:06.555 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweet heart.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.455 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to tune
into your knowingness?

00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.818 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to do
a little bit of what

00:05:15.818 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I call a meditation for you.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is really to blend
the energies together,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.661 align:middle line:84%
and the people at
home as well so you

00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
can become part of
this experience.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.588 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to blend all
of our energy together as one

00:05:24.588 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and make it very receptive.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.714 align:middle line:84%
So when we do the
intuition work,

00:05:27.714 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
when we do the
psychic work, we're

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
able to receive the
energy easier, OK?

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just to ask you
to just close your eyes

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:90%
and put your feet on the floor.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.193 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to lead you
in a slight meditation,

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
a small meditation, just to
open you up to your knowingness.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.485 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So those at home that
are watching right now,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
you also can just
close your eyes

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and listen to my voice and the
sound of the music behind it.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit in
the chairs here,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:84%
just be connected to
the physical body.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.302 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of your
feet on the floor.

00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And close your eyes.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:10%
Be mindful of your legs.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:10%
Be mindful of the physical body,
your backs upon the chairs,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:10%
your shoulders and your arms
and your hands, your neck,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:10%
your head, and just become
aware of this physical vessel.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there are some
aches and pains.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:90%
You can acknowledge them.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But don't give them
too much energy.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Don't give them too much energy.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.122 align:middle line:84%
Realize that you have
it, and then move on.

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And realize that
really who you are

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual being having
a human experience, and not

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
the other way around.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So just with that
thought in your mind,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
if you would just
think, realize, just

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:84%
have that awareness that you
are a souled being, a spiritual

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
being encased in a
physical human shell.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But as a spirit, you have a very
strong sense of knowingness,

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
of awareness.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:90%
We are all one energy.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine right now that
there's a beautiful green light

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.625 align:middle line:84%
in your heart, this beautiful
green light in your heart.

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And there's a center of healing.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
This is your center, a really,
really beautiful center

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of unconditional love,
of peace, of forgiveness.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Just be mindful of that.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.677 align:middle line:84%
Be also very, very aware
of the center below that.

00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Right in the middle of your
stomach is the solar plexus.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's a yellow, a bright,
bright yellow color, bright,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
bright yellow gold color.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And if it's hard for
you to imagine that,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
you can just maybe picture
a golden sun coming down

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
into the body and sitting
right in your tummy,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.780 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful golden yellow sun.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
This is your seat
of knowingness.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:84%
This is your main
psychic center,

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:90%
the center of knowingness.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:90%
And it is what it is.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that it is.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And just connect with that
beautiful yellow center.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.675 align:middle line:84%
It is not what you
think, but how you feel.

00:08:01.675 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So just become aware
that all of your thoughts

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
drop down to your stomach.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the mind
goes down to the stomach.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And just open up that
sense of knowingness,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:90%
that sense of feeling.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:90%
There is no judgment.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It just is being, a
strong sense of beingness,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:90%
a strong sense of knowingness.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that,
remember that you are love.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
You are loved by the spirit
world all around you.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:90%
We all have guides.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
We have loved ones
who have passed over.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
They are here with
you all the time.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.498 align:middle line:90%
They are surrounding you.

00:08:40.498 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
And they will blend
with you and help

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you to step into
that knowingness,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to step into your
psychic ability

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and just open up and be
the truth that you are.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
So as you feel the love of
the spirit all around you,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
they surround you in
a green light of love.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So now as you have that
beautiful green light of love,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:84%
just surround the person next
to you on the right side of you.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Surround the person next to you
with this beautiful green light

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:90%
of love.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%
And slowly open up your eyes.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.220 align:middle line:90%
And be as one.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:90%
So did you enjoy that?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Did you enjoy that?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:20.615 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.679 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to now is
just to demonstrate with you

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
about the psychic work, about
how you yourself can read.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to do
that with just showing you

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:90%
how to do an exercise.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do it first
and show you how to do it.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.972 align:middle line:90%
And then you're going to do it.

00:09:39.972 --> 00:09:40.930 align:middle line:90%
So don't be too scared.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm going guide you through it.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Young lady, would you mind
working with me today?

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have you come
up here, if that's OK?

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.145 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Gianna.

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How are you?

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good, good, good.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.747 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do a psychic
exercise with you, which

00:09:52.747 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
all the audience do.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So you guys better
be watching this.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.046 align:middle line:90%
Watch out for my back.

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
Excuse my back.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to show you how

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
you can tune into the
knowingness, yeah?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask
Gianna for an object

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that you have on your
person, whether it's

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.797 align:middle line:84%
a ring, a watch,
whatever you have.

00:10:04.797 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And you have--

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I do
have a ring, yes.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You have a ring.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to tune into
the energy on the ring.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:90%
So we are all energy.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We are all molecules
that vibrate or move

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:90%
at a certain rate of speed, yes?

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.665 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is Gianna's
energy is on this ring.

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Now this could be, if it
belonged to somebody else,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
there might be somebody
else's energy on this ring.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's say it was a
grandmother or someone else.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.393 align:middle line:90%
Her energy could be on the ring.

00:10:24.393 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Also, you could find out more
about the history of the ring,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.942 align:middle line:84%
where she bought
the ring, how it

00:10:28.942 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
was given to her,
the circumstances

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.130 align:middle line:90%
that she obtained this ring.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to see
what I get from this.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the
sense of knowingness.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:37.746 align:middle line:90%
It's intuition.

00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing to do
with the mediumship.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.855 align:middle line:90%
So it's nothing to do spirit.

00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:42.563 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to be
what I'm picking up

00:10:42.563 --> 00:10:44.452 align:middle line:90%
from you psychically, OK?

00:10:44.452 --> 00:10:46.785 align:middle line:84%
OK, so number one, the first
thing I get very, very much

00:10:46.785 --> 00:10:48.842 align:middle line:84%
is you are a very
compassionate individual.

00:10:48.842 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You're very, very
much a person who

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:84%
came onto this
earth who feels as

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.829 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't fit in right away.

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And you always felt very
different from everybody else.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.455 align:middle line:84%
And you were very much a
loner when you were a kid.

00:10:58.455 --> 00:10:59.320 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.479 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:11:00.479 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:90%
And I know that you felt that.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.519 align:middle line:84%
And were you one
of three children?

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:04.185 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Two.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two children.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And was there one that was
lost or one miscarried, please?

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: See,
because I know.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I know there was one of three.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I just get that from
this information right

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:90%
from here, OK?

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a
very creative soul.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I know you have come back
with a very strong gift

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:90%
would be with colors.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.796 align:middle line:90%
So artwork be very good for you.

00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Aesthetics, design work would
be very, very good for you.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.058 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:11:24.058 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And also like a
clothing design as well.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.760 align:middle line:84%
You're very, very good at
putting aesthetics together.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
I can say fabrics together,
aesthetics together.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
You put things together
very, very nicely as far as

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
in the atmosphere and the
environment that you have.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.528 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're also very
much a leader in your family

00:11:38.528 --> 00:11:40.614 align:middle line:84%
in that you came back into
this world at this time

00:11:40.614 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
because you have to be a leader,
because the rest of your family

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:90%
members were not as strong.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.271 align:middle line:84%
And when you were a young
girl, you had to be the adult.

00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So one of the adults
was not there for you

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:84%
emotionally when you
were a young girl.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.055 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:11:52.055 --> 00:11:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.388 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:11:53.388 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I need to let you know
that your soul-- and this is

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
all I'm getting from this--
that you just came in

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.174 align:middle line:84%
to help in that role of
the adult as a child,

00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:90%
because you were the leader.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.316 align:middle line:90%
You're the pioneer.

00:12:03.316 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've been a leader in
many, many lifetimes as well.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
But that's who your spirit is.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.993 align:middle line:84%
You're a very, I said before, a
very compassionate individual.

00:12:09.993 --> 00:12:12.134 align:middle line:84%
You're very sensitive,
sometimes too sensitive.

00:12:12.134 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And your someone
who tends to wear

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:90%
their heart on their sleeve, OK?

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
You're also a person who
I feel very, very much

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of money
around you coming to you.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel this
lifetime-- thank you.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:90%
We love that.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:90%
We love that, right?

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I just got to tell
you that I feel

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.275 align:middle line:90%
as if you have earned that.

00:12:29.275 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Karmically, you
have earned that.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:90%
And I think we do.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.569 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
money is an energy.

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It's what you do with
it that matters, yes?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I think that
will be coming to you in waves.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to
go out and look for it.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It will come to you.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.922 align:middle line:90%
It's like your fortune.

00:12:40.922 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel like
you have to marry for it.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I just feel it's going
to find its way to you.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.077 align:middle line:90%
It will.

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And it will be just
going on you path.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.036 align:middle line:90%
Just go on on your path.

00:12:49.036 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you that I feel
when you were a young girl,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the family is very
strong around you.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.005 align:middle line:84%
And I know religion would be
strong around you as well.

00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:58.255 align:middle line:84%
I know that you must have
come in as either a Catholic

00:12:58.255 --> 00:13:00.035 align:middle line:84%
or a Christian or
something like this, yes?

00:13:00.035 --> 00:13:00.701 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:03.365 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know this
looks like a cross here too.

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, it is.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:04.957 align:middle line:90%
It's Jesus.

00:13:04.957 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, all right.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.953 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see that.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And can I just-- was this made
from somebody else's cross

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:90%
was this made for you?

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It was made
specifically for me, yeah.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what I felt.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.035 align:middle line:90%
I felt it was made for you.

00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:19.147 align:middle line:90%
It was strongly for you.

00:13:19.147 --> 00:13:20.605 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you-- I'm not

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:22.438 align:middle line:84%
going to get to the
mediumship, but I could.

00:13:22.438 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Because you're very open.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.895 align:middle line:90%
There's a grandmother here.

00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a woman standing
right next to me here.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure if it's your mom.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Did you mom pass over?

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
it's a grandmother.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Gramdother.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Grandmother.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:90%
But I don't want to do that yet.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I could easily go there,
because I'm used to doing that.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm used to
going to, that level.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But I just want stay in the
psychic, psychic, level,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.604 align:middle line:90%
the very psychic level.

00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you that if-- I
don't know you're married now.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
married, you will be.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:90%
If you're not--

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, OK.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.513 align:middle line:90%
So that's good news.

00:13:45.513 --> 00:13:46.804 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, you wil be.

00:13:46.804 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm psychically
telling you this.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be, on a December,

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:90%
not this year, but the December.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.843 align:middle line:84%
Remember the month of December
will be very significant as far

00:13:54.843 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:90%
as a relationship.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.016 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to be someone who

00:13:57.016 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:84%
has to go and kiss many, many
frogs to find the prince.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find-- I feel
like it's the second person.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's not gonna be
that difficult for you.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm gong to tell you
I feel it's, again

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.466 align:middle line:90%
a karmic type of relationship.

00:14:09.466 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
know this person.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you that
I'm psychically picking up

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
it could be a name like a P
name, like a Peter or a Paul.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
P-- comes, and
that's what I feel.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I do feel that you're also
going to go to Europe.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.638 align:middle line:84%
I feel that water in
Europe is important,

00:14:21.638 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
like looking over at
France, or the water there,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.566 align:middle line:84%
the Mediterranean, something
like that, or Italy.

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel as if you're going
to go there to honeymoon, yes?

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.686 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's
what I pick up, yeah.

00:14:31.686 --> 00:14:34.872 align:middle line:84%
I also pick up two
children for you, for you.

00:14:34.872 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to make
a great, great mother.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's gong
to be a great joy.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.673 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
find there's going

00:14:39.673 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to be a little difficulty
in balancing your career

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:90%
life and your family life.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to take
some adjustment, OK?

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.441 align:middle line:90%
So I got to tell you that.

00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All
right, darling?

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's amazing.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.046 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that good?

00:14:49.046 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Did that make sense?

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, that's great.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, here you go.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, sweetheart.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.648 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there we go.

00:14:54.648 --> 00:14:55.148 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:57.246 align:middle line:84%
Now, did you see
how open she was?

00:14:57.246 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
She was very, very open.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.719 align:middle line:84%
And she was very,
very just calm.

00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't nervous.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.747 align:middle line:90%
She was just like open.

00:15:02.747 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And it flowed.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.035 align:middle line:90%
It flowed.

00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a partner
that's very closed or nervous

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or wanting a
certain agenda, it's

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be hard for
you to read them.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.602 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you to find
a partner next to you.

00:15:13.602 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And you at home, you can
do this-- with someone

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.034 align:middle line:90%
you don't know would be best.

00:15:17.034 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So turn to the
person next to you.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
work with a partner.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you to do is I
want you to exchange an object,

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.957 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a ring, whether
it's-- you can even use

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
the hand of the
person if you want to.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And what's going to
happen is that you're

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.857 align:middle line:84%
going to read each other
psychically, right?

00:15:31.857 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to read
each other psychically.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.024 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
talk to them necessarily

00:15:36.024 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
like I was talking
to Gianna here.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.709 align:middle line:90%
I just want you to hold that.

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you when you
can share the information.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.595 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you to
hold the information.

00:15:42.595 --> 00:15:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you
to close your eyes.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.719 align:middle line:84%
Hold it to your gut,
you psychic center.

00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And in your mind, I just want
you to start picking things up.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And don't think about it.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.398 align:middle line:90%
Just start picking things up.

00:15:51.398 --> 00:15:55.117 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll tell you
when you can share, OK?

00:15:55.117 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Exchange at the same time.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:90%
You can exchange now.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:90%
At home, you can do this too.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.045 align:middle line:84%
Exchange with somebody
you don't know though.

00:16:01.045 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Now close your eyes if you want.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:90%
And then bring it into your gut.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you start picking
up, just put into your mind.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.731 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
when you can share.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to rationalize.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to fit it
into some conditioning.

It's not about you.

00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
See, now you're
getting more into it

shifting in the room.

00:16:33.324 --> 00:16:35.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, now you can share with
the person, your partner,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you got.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.474 align:middle line:90%

yourself permission to feel,

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.585 align:middle line:90%
the easier it got, right?

I mean, did it?

>>AUDIENCE: She had a ring.

00:17:58.735 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:90%
And the ring was kind of heavy.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:90%
And it had significance.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like she's
a weighted person

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of significance.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:11.227 align:middle line:90%
And the object is her in a way.

>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you think
she weighs herself down

>>AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:84%
That could be
exactly the feeling.

That's probably it.

So what did you get for Andrea?

00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I thought when
I was holding the scarf,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.955 align:middle line:84%
I felt her warmth, like
she's a very warm--

It's a light scarf.

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:42.746 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's pretty true.

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.829 align:middle line:84%

And then I though of earth.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And we were kind of going there.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.406 align:middle line:90%

through her grandmother.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And it meant a lot to her.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%

about a year and a half.

00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:46.679 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
wow, very good.

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Very good, very good, very good.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.311 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:49.311 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And what I want to
do now is I want

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.420 align:middle line:84%
to do another kind of
exercise where you just-- it's

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
just the energy that
you pick up, yes?

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:90%
So I would like this young lady.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.644 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:20:02.644 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Janet.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Janet.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:90%
There you go, Janet.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Janet.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So Janet-- and this is
just a hypothetical.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But as you look
in this room here

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and you look around
the audience here,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and if you want someone to
give you a reading, just--

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and don't take it personally.

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Who do you feel attracted to?

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Who would you want a
reading from as you

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.466 align:middle line:90%
look around this room.

00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Besides me, beside me.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't count.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.061 align:middle line:90%
Pretend I'm not here.

00:20:37.061 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You
didn't clarify that.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Besides me.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I guess
I'm drawn to this lady

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.872 align:middle line:90%
here in the blond hair.

00:20:44.872 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The white hair?

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.205 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Gray hair-- blonde.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Blonde.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And why are you
attracted to her.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.251 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
She just is--
she's sticking out.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she's just prominent
in what I see here.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your energy
is the attracted there

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.466 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:90%
There's something about her.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:90%
There's a light.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:05.039 align:middle line:90%
There's an energy.

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
There's some knowingness
that psychically you're

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.761 align:middle line:84%
picking up something that
you're connecting with her.

00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:10.845 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very good.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, darling.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.555 align:middle line:84%
Sweetheart, would
you mind standing up?

00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
do the same thing,

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.264 align:middle line:84%
so just as you feel the energy
you're being pulled toward.

00:21:23.264 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Psychically being pulled to
this energy, what do you feel?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.096 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
read by somebody

00:21:27.096 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
or even if you want to get
to know somebody better,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.809 align:middle line:90%
who do feel attracted toward?

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
physically now.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
energetically.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, besides
me, energetically,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.415 align:middle line:90%
what do you feel?

00:21:38.415 --> 00:21:40.332 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm feeling
the same way with her.

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:42.081 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
isn't that interesting?

00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what I
thought was going to happen.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because like attracts like.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a wavelength.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And you will be attracted to
the same type of individual,

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the same type of personality.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same level.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, isn't it?

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.369 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:21:58.369 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my love.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:90%
And young man?

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.997 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:22:01.997 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How are you?

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Just fine.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you mind standing?

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.128 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:22:05.128 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:90%
I bet you ride a motorcycle.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.022 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Psychic.

00:22:10.022 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Leonard.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Leonard.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Leonard.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.175 align:middle line:84%
What would-- same
thing with you.

00:22:13.175 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I just want to go
around and just see.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And hold the microphone close to
your mouth so we can hear you.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:90%
So look all around.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: The lady over there.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The lady in the--

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: --the purple

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.994 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --the purple.

00:22:20.994 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that?

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Why do you feel a
connection there?

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Maybe
something from my family.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.368 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Something
from your family.

00:22:30.368 --> 00:22:33.019 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Like an aunt or
something that has passed on.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Besides
the aunt, what do you

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:37.061 align:middle line:84%
feel about this
person here though?

00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That she's
a very good person.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A good person.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very kind.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.635 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kind
and compassionate.

00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, right, right.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good,
good, good, good, good.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.587 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:45.587 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.346 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:47.346 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to put this here.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.635 align:middle line:90%
I think that he read you.

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:51.718 align:middle line:84%
And it's the first time
he's done this, of course.

00:22:51.718 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was good
for a very beginning.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.076 align:middle line:84%
And once you start trusting
the more information you're

00:22:57.076 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
getting, as you
did the exercise,

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
you start trusting
it, you really

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:84%
will really start to
get more stuff, yeah?

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I also think that--
may I come to you?

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.822 align:middle line:84%
Would that be OK
if I work with you?

00:23:06.822 --> 00:23:07.447 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:07.447 --> 00:23:08.421 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:09.380 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Betsy.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Betsy.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Betsy, the reason
I want to talk to

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.422 align:middle line:84%
is because as this gentleman
was speaking to you,

00:23:14.422 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing
spirit around you.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to
connect with you, OK?

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:90%
I think he was accurate.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I think he was just beginning
to scratch the surface.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.011 align:middle line:84%
But I think he also is very
accurate when he says--

00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go from
now the psychic reading

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.515 align:middle line:84%
to the mediumship
and see how it works.

00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I agree
with him that you're

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:90%
very, very compassionate.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.290 align:middle line:90%
You're a very giving person.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you had to learn
to put up your boundaries

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.307 align:middle line:90%
and defenses early on.

00:23:36.307 --> 00:23:38.056 align:middle line:84%
Because I think when
you were a young girl

00:23:38.056 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:90%
there was abuse issues there.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I understand that.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.945 align:middle line:84%
You're dad's passed into
the world of the spirit.

00:23:41.945 --> 00:23:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because as I
stand her to work with you,

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
your father comes over to me.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.566 align:middle line:90%
And there are uncles as well.

00:23:47.566 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
people behind them.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
The uncles come in first.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And the aunts come behind
them, which is very odd for me

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:90%
to see that.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you usually
have the women first,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:90%
the men behind them.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
your father and brothers

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:84%
want to come in
and speak to you.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go back
to an abuse issue

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.494 align:middle line:90%
when I'm a young girl, OK?

00:24:03.494 --> 00:24:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.655 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:24:04.655 --> 00:24:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
just want to apologize.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.747 align:middle line:90%
And I want to say I'm sorry.

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:09.372 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:09.372 --> 00:24:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand?

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.695 align:middle line:84%
And I know around the age of
seven, the age of eight-- seven

00:24:12.695 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and eight years of age--
this happened, correct?

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.333 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
your father is just very--

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:19.802 align:middle line:84%
I feel there was a very
dysfunctional family.

00:24:19.802 --> 00:24:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that your dad came
from a dysfunctional family.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that things
were not said, you know?

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything was secretive--

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.418 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --in
the family line.

00:24:28.418 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Notice I say the family line,
not necessarily just your dad,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.040 align:middle line:84%
but his whole family, like these
two brothers I see with him.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And who is a rose?

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.055 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing a rose.

00:24:37.055 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's my mother.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mother.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And it's a rose.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My mom
is not in spirit.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mom's still alive?

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.866 align:middle line:90%
Mom's still alive.

00:24:41.866 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So I know what he's
talking to me about rose.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So would they call
your mother Rose?

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Did he call your
mother Rosa or Rose.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, he
used to call her Rosie.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.328 align:middle line:90%
And it twerked her off.

00:24:49.328 --> 00:24:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's why he's saying it.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know that.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that he's coming
and mentioning her.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about the prayers

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that she sent him
after he passes.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to tell you
something from your father.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I get a really
strong sense of he

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.010 align:middle line:84%
understands that things in his
life-- he's not proud of things

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:90%
that he did in life.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:84%
There were things he was
not honest about in life.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he tried
to get over on some people.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he didn't
talk to some family

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
members for a long
period of time.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.906 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he's
trying to apologize

00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:90%
to you and other siblings here.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Who has ties toward
Texas at one time?

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have an aunt
who lived there for awhile.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:31.484 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In Texas, OK?

00:25:31.484 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you would understand

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the name of Parker,
the name Parker.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Last name would
be Parker or Park.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.305 align:middle line:84%
But this is something I
need to ask you about.

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't know that.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Don't know why Parker or Park.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.794 align:middle line:84%
And did your dad have
a drinking problem?

00:25:44.794 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
that that drinking problem

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.110 align:middle line:84%
with this gentleman,
I know the name

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Park or Parker is
significant, OK?

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know in my mind,
as he projects into my mind

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:84%
a certain memory that
he has, that that name

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:90%
would be important.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.729 align:middle line:84%
So it could be Park Avenue,
Park Street, Parker.

00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going
to throw it at you

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:90%
because I know it's significant.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:84%
I know also, by the way,
before he passes over,

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.637 align:middle line:90%
was he not able to communicate?

00:26:10.637 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did he
ever have a cowboy hat?

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're
sure about that?

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:16.668 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:16.668 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Who had the cowboy hat
or wears a cowboy hat?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much everybody around us.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:90%
My sister used to wear one.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did
you recently see her?

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.068 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:24.068 --> 00:26:27.386 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, would you know
if she has a straw cowboy hat?

00:26:27.386 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She does.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would you know
that there's hole in the rim.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:90%
There's a little hole.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes,
there is, because you're

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.498 align:middle line:90%
dad is telling me that.

00:26:33.498 --> 00:26:35.456 align:middle line:84%
He says, there's a
hole in the brim.

00:26:35.456 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a hole in the brim.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.204 align:middle line:90%
And she plays with it like this.

00:26:38.204 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
He see her play
with it like this.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
when she was younger.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.571 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
there's a Jimmy somewhere.

00:26:43.571 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That is my father.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.079 align:middle line:90%
So the name Jimmy comes in.

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:48.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's bringing me that name.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And I know I get with Jimmy that
you really have to forgive him.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I really got to
give that to you.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you that
because I know that he only

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:84%
could do with the
capacity he knew, yes?

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I
understand that.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
he have another family

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
separate from your family?

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't there another, like a
step family or another family--

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.175 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:08.175 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --wasn't there.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was
married before.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So I know that there's
another family before,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.493 align:middle line:84%
because he gives me
that sense or that

00:27:13.493 --> 00:27:15.420 align:middle line:84%
feeling that there's
another family before.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And he really was--
he said he wasn't

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:90%
fully honest with everybody.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk about
who had a tractor or was--

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
did have a tractor.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.080 align:middle line:84%
What did he used to
use that tractor for?

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.415 align:middle line:90%
Was it just fun?

00:27:31.415 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, he
grew up on a farm.

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.849 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And so he
got this old tractor

00:27:34.849 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
and rode it everywhere.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so see,
he's known for this tractor.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's very significant
that he speaks about that.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.741 align:middle line:84%
And do you know if your
sister, by the way,

00:27:41.741 --> 00:27:44.050 align:middle line:90%
was going to go to a-- go what?

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Go away?

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.490 align:middle line:84%
She was going to-- She
was going to go away.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Your sister was
going to go away.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.829 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand about that?

00:27:48.829 --> 00:27:49.494 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:49.494 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Where's your mom now?

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She lives with
my sister across town.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.498 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:54.498 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Are you not getting
along with that sister?

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something
came up with that sister

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:90%
and your mother, please?

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It makes it
hard for me to see mom.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
they live together.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what your
dad is getting at.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's men behind
him, these uncles.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a grandmother over
there and a grandfather.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I got to tell you

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel you were closer
to your grandmother

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.432 align:middle line:84%
when you were growing
up in many, many ways.

00:28:12.432 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:13.645 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:13.645 --> 00:28:14.353 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:14.353 --> 00:28:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you that the
spirit world works really,

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.009 align:middle line:90%
really hard to be here.

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
They work really, really
hard to come here.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And for the healing it
takes them to come here

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and to help to heal you
and for you to be here,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you that
there's no accidents.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.582 align:middle line:84%
I believe there's
divine intervention.

00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
must have been raised

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.745 align:middle line:84%
with a Bible or
religion and reading.

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Who's reading the
passages of the Bible

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%
or reading the passages?

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Was your grandmother
very religious, please?

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:39.318 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I keep on being
reciting passages of the Bible.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, the
Lord is my shepherd.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:90%
I shall not want.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:46.885 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:48.991 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do a
whole bunch of stuff here.

00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:49.615 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:49.615 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I want to tell you

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.612 align:middle line:84%
that the spirit people learn
from us here on the earth.

00:28:58.612 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Just because they pass
over to the spirit world

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.444 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that they
have all the answers.

00:29:02.444 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:90%
We help them down here.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And the best thing we
can do to help them

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
is to live the best
life possible down here.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I know
that the past was the past.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.207 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it
wasn't a fun past.

00:29:15.207 --> 00:29:17.665 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it wasn't sunny
on your side of the street.

00:29:17.665 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.875 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I know
there was some violence.

00:29:19.875 --> 00:29:21.200 align:middle line:90%
I know there was some abuse.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:90%
And we know this.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.155 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going to
start to let it go--

00:29:24.155 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.701 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --and forgive it.

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't, and
we hold onto that energy,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.785 align:middle line:90%
it starts eating away at us.

00:29:30.785 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.047 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You understand?

00:29:33.047 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, there's nothing

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:90%
if we hold on to things.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's your choice, of course.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.166 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
all of our choices.

00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:84%
If we hold on to past
hurts and past ways

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and don't forgive people because
they don't see who we might be,

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.930 align:middle line:90%
we're just as bad as they are.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
know what I mean?

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.896 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I think that you

00:29:49.896 --> 00:29:52.270 align:middle line:84%
have that capacity of a
healer, a strong healer.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- because
this grandmother lady

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
keeps on showing me this
Bible thing, the prayer thing.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.155 align:middle line:90%
As she said, you have prayed.

00:29:58.155 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
You have asked
your prayers to be

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.505 align:middle line:84%
answered for the
past 2 and 1/2 years.

00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:03.847 align:middle line:84%
You have asked prayers to
be-- you understand that?

00:30:03.847 --> 00:30:05.222 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
certainly, I do.

00:30:05.222 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
You've been asking.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:90%
You've been asking.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:90%
You've been asking.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:84%
She's been making that
very, very strong.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.378 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and here we
are, answering your prayer.

00:30:11.378 --> 00:30:13.184 align:middle line:90%
Won't you listen to us?

00:30:13.184 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.558 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:14.558 --> 00:30:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we got it to take
you and hit you over the head,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:90%
and to listen.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.082 align:middle line:84%
And did you have two marriages,
two relationships yourself?

00:30:22.082 --> 00:30:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:23.498 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:23.498 --> 00:30:25.719 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just she's just
telling you this.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as if
I want them to heal me,

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to bring me back together again.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you
could see what I see,

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:90%
boy, you'd be just lighting up.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.251 align:middle line:90%
You'd be lighting up.

00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell
you that there's

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.489 align:middle line:84%
an animal, a dog
that passed over.

00:30:42.489 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:90%
And you put the dog down.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And the dog passed over.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:45.592 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:30:45.592 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give
you this doggy.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.206 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to you this doggy.

00:30:49.206 --> 00:30:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you wanted
to do something-- hold on.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
You wanted-- there was something
a little strange that you

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.945 align:middle line:90%
wanted when the dog was down.

00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you wanted a clip

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.805 align:middle line:84%
or something of the
hair of the dog.

00:31:01.805 --> 00:31:02.845 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my god, yeah.

00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And you wanted this.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I took
a snip of his tail.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The tail.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I was going to say the tail.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm sorry.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.154 align:middle line:90%
Dang it.

00:31:12.154 --> 00:31:14.330 align:middle line:90%
It would have verified it.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.447 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It was
right toward the end,

00:31:16.447 --> 00:31:17.196 align:middle line:90%
like the very tip.

00:31:17.196 --> 00:31:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
wasn't a reddish?

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Was it a reddish brownish thing?

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:20.991 align:middle line:90%
What was it?

00:31:20.991 --> 00:31:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a springer.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I clipped
was actually white.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.490 align:middle line:90%
But he was liver colored.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.540 align:middle line:90%
So it was a reddish brown spot.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I saw reddish
brown in my mind's eye.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:90%
I see the plastic bag.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.845 align:middle line:90%
I also see a cross.

00:31:32.845 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I see candles.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.917 align:middle line:90%
I see photographs.

00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I see, not only that though,
but I feel you had many dogs.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.958 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you that I'm
thanking you from the spirit

00:31:40.958 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:84%
world from the animal kingdom,
and that you're very kind.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're more
kind to the animal

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:90%
than you are kind to yourself.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.693 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And on
behalf of your doggies,

00:31:49.693 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:84%
especially this one--
please-- loves you very much.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Would you please love yourself?

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:90%
You're fabulous.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.825 align:middle line:90%
You just got to know it.

00:31:56.825 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:57.915 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right?

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave
you with that.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.576 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:00.576 --> 00:32:01.094 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:01.094 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
you know, when we

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.676 align:middle line:84%
do these readings or messages
from the spirit world,

00:32:04.676 --> 00:32:07.640 align:middle line:84%
it's always also-- it might
be directed to one person.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.559 align:middle line:84%
But it's also-- we can also
experience something from that.

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Because we're all human beings.

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And we can relate to
many of those issues.

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.682 align:middle line:84%
So even though it's great
for one person to receive it,

00:32:16.682 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
it's really for
everybody that's watching

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.973 align:middle line:84%
the show, that's
here in the audience.

00:32:19.973 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very true.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I have a man here.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.059 align:middle line:84%
He's a father figure. he comes
in to my left side over here.

00:32:25.059 --> 00:32:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm going to go
in this area right over here.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I want to
go to that man back there.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.215 align:middle line:90%
But I feel like I want to.

00:32:32.215 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not sure yet.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:90%
So let me just get it.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I have a gentleman
here that passes away.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like definitely
my lungs are affected.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.926 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's an
infection in the lungs

00:32:38.926 --> 00:32:40.400 align:middle line:90%
or it's a-- I'm not sure.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like my
lungs either collapsed

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:84%
or I have issues with my
lungs and I can't breathe.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.710 align:middle line:90%
And I have oxygen.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:48.039 align:middle line:90%
I have oxygen problems here.

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And that would be your
father, wouldn't it?

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:90%
May I come to please, sir?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I knew it was you.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.764 align:middle line:90%
I had a feeling it was you.

00:32:53.764 --> 00:32:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And I got to come to you.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Greg.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Greg.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing, Greg?

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.982 align:middle line:84%
So Greg, I had a feeling
that this was your father.

00:33:00.982 --> 00:33:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But I had to make sure
the evidence comes

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in very strongly.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.605 align:middle line:84%
And I get very, very
emotional with this gentleman.

00:33:07.605 --> 00:33:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to tell
you that this healing is

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:90%
for everybody and you.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know you came here
for him today, he said.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.282 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:14.282 --> 00:33:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: As I get this
gentlemen here, your dad,

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you that he's a
very, very outgoing gentleman.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.085 align:middle line:84%
He's a very, very-- I want
to say he's outgoing to me.

00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:24.960 align:middle line:84%
He has a lot of
gratitude that he came,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:84%
that he came through
here to me and that I

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:84%
was able to get
some stuff from him.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.220 align:middle line:90%
He's very anxious.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.280 align:middle line:90%
And he's nervous.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to have him
calm down a little bit, OK?

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I want to see him.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I see him in a hospital.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm seeing him there.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.208 align:middle line:84%
And I need to ask you if there
was a change in the hospital

00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:43.440 align:middle line:90%
rooms please?

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't there?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:90%
He was in one room he said.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he had to
go to another unit

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.574 align:middle line:90%
or another area of the hospital.

00:33:48.574 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He moved
within the hospital, yes.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.836 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there
were two different rooms.

00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:53.730 align:middle line:90%
One was a room.

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And the next is like
a unit of some kind.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I know when I go into
that second unit,

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.316 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I
definitely need oxygen.

00:33:59.316 --> 00:34:01.315 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely feel
like I have bags over here

00:34:01.315 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and bags over here, IV stuff
going on here and over here.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.009 align:middle line:90%
I know one is hydration.

00:34:06.009 --> 00:34:06.800 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at it.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And he's like [SIGHS] And he's
kind of a controlling guy.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.596 align:middle line:84%
He likes to control
his environment.

00:34:10.596 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:90%
He never wants to be sick.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't sick a day in
his life, he said to me.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.568 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know?

00:34:15.568 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's proud of that fact.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.409 align:middle line:90%
He's a very proud man.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.325 align:middle line:84%
And he's proud of the
fact that he wasn't sick

00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:21.290 align:middle line:90%
a day in his life.

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know why the
name Lawrence or Larry

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:24.924 align:middle line:90%
would be significant to him.

00:34:24.924 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A brother.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it'd
be significant to him,

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:90%
the Lawrence and Larry.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Is that still down here, living
Larry, or Larry the spirit?

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.090 align:middle line:90%
They're all gone.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Didn't
Larry go before him?

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.364 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:37.739 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that Lawrence or Larry would

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:84%
have brought him
over, helped him over.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.406 align:middle line:90%
And I know that-- go on.

00:34:43.406 --> 00:34:44.489 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, you got through.

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:90%
He's making sure I got through.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:84%
He wants to give me
memories, memories.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.104 align:middle line:84%
Now before I was
talking about Texas.

00:34:50.104 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I want
to go back to Texas.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:90%
But I do.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.179 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I used
to live in Texas.

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He visited me there.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm seeing, like, the
state of Texas over your head.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know, Greg, that you
would have-- yeah, go on.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.539 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:35:05.539 --> 00:35:06.611 align:middle line:90%
He's really excited here.

00:35:06.611 --> 00:35:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And would there
have been a birthday

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:09.712 align:middle line:90%
that just finished passing?

00:35:09.712 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mine.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I want
to give you the birthday, yeah.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Something about your
birthday just passed.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to give that
birthday greeting.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.966 align:middle line:90%
And you know I was with you.

00:35:15.966 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:90%
You know I was with you.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And I like the
new car, something

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:84%
about getting the new car,
thoughts about the new car.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm thinking
about buying some new cars.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.713 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I'm going to tell you,

00:35:25.713 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
it almost feels like it's a gift
from your father for you, OK?

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.977 align:middle line:84%
Do you have his belts
or a belt of your dad's?

00:35:30.977 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I've
got a number of belts

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:33.518 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:34.941 align:middle line:90%
And I know you have my ties.

00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: A few.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.481 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:35:36.481 --> 00:35:37.900 align:middle line:90%
I know you have that.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.526 align:middle line:90%
One looks like it's striped.

00:35:39.526 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.300 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.008 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:42.008 --> 00:35:42.922 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:35:42.922 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that the time
in Texas he's going back to,

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel you would have
lived there, yes.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if you
would have lived there,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.310 align:middle line:90%
then you left.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.842 align:middle line:84%
And you could have
come back again.

00:35:52.842 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I worked for IBM.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So I was in and
out of Texas a lot.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, OK.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Because I keep going in and out.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.051 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
he's going on about.

00:35:59.051 --> 00:36:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And before I was
talking to a lady.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And I got the name
Parker, Parker.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:05.467 align:middle line:90%
Now that might be for you.

00:36:05.467 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Parker, Texas.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:09.176 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:36:09.176 --> 00:36:10.217 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's it.

00:36:10.217 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this gentleman
just said that to me.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.310 align:middle line:84%
He goes, it was me trying
to get that through.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:90%
We got our wires crossed.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.110 align:middle line:90%
But that does happen.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:90%
See, isn't that interesting?

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.260 align:middle line:90%
So that's significant.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
there's validation.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:26.801 align:middle line:90%
Now-- got it.

00:36:26.801 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Got it. [WHISTLES] Pickup
truck, the big pickup truck--

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.825 align:middle line:84%
you have a big pickup truck
or he had a big pickup truck,

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
or somebody got
the pickup truck.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I got the truck.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.857 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah, he knows about it.

00:36:38.857 --> 00:36:40.315 align:middle line:84%
I know that your
dad likes details.

00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your dad likes
to tell people what to do.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that he likes be told,
you're going to do this.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be this way.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.895 align:middle line:84%
And he gets really
upset when his words

00:36:47.895 --> 00:36:48.900 align:middle line:90%
aren't follow through.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:49.733 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:49.733 --> 00:36:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a New
York City police officer.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.757 align:middle line:90%
He's used to giving orders.

00:36:54.757 --> 00:36:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, that's very
interesting, because before, I

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:90%
was getting saluting.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Because I was getting this.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't bring it forth.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.380 align:middle line:84%
But this whole thing about
saluting-- and that's

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:90%
either military or police.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it interesting we
had a police person here right

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:90%
when we started.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.242 align:middle line:90%
There are no accidents.

00:37:12.242 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:90%
I know this is a common name.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.401 align:middle line:84%
But would you know
the name of Mary?

00:37:15.401 --> 00:37:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Grandmother.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.108 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:17.108 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to give a
love from a Mary to you.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that when
you were a little baby,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
you were a little
tough little baby.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.330 align:middle line:84%
You were a little
tough little baby.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And you would cry a
lot, she was telling me.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:26.762 align:middle line:90%
And she's funny about that.

00:37:26.762 --> 00:37:27.720 align:middle line:90%
She's funny about that.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:90%
And-- go on.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:29.749 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:31.102 align:middle line:90%
Do you play golf?

00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Have you been talking
about playing golf recently

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.730 align:middle line:90%
with a friend?

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.220 align:middle line:84%
You were talking to
somebody about playing golf.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.920 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that right?

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.856 align:middle line:84%
Because your dad and the
grandma is coming in here.

00:37:40.856 --> 00:37:41.980 align:middle line:90%
And they're just coming in.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling
me about that.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They're telling you
had plans in your mind

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:46.500 align:middle line:84%
or you either called
somebody up or thought,

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.833 align:middle line:84%
you know, I got to get out
there and get the golf going.

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Are the clubs in a
garage or something?

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They're
in a motor home.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A motor home.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Your father's all
connected with that.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why,
but he's connected

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.311 align:middle line:84%
with that, the motor
home, the whole thing.

00:37:58.311 --> 00:38:00.307 align:middle line:84%
And why do I want to
go to Arizona as well?

00:38:00.307 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Did you go on a trip to Arizona
or did he want to go to a trip

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:03.546 align:middle line:90%
to Arizona?

00:38:03.546 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, we're
thinking about going to Arizona.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.710 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm seeing the red rock.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing Sedona.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'm seeing Phoenix.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.274 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the whole
beautiful area.

00:38:13.274 --> 00:38:14.065 align:middle line:90%
You're going to go.

00:38:14.065 --> 00:38:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Your father's telling
me you're going to go.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go to the
month of May for a birthday.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.365 align:middle line:90%
Who's coming up in May?

00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Is it his birthday?

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Or is it-- what's
significant in May.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My wife's
birthday is in May.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
wife's in May.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.961 align:middle line:90%
OK, very good, very good.

00:38:23.961 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.917 align:middle line:90%
Where is she now, your wife?

00:38:28.917 --> 00:38:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: At home.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.652 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Why
isn't she here?

00:38:31.652 --> 00:38:32.152 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:32.152 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She's--

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did you tell her
you were coming here today?

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.203 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I know that they

00:38:37.203 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:90%
wanted to say hello to her.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I want you to ask that Kathleen
is related to her and find out.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to know-- go on.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, your father's
saying-- he's so funny.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:90%
He's a real jokester, your dad.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.870 align:middle line:90%
He is a joker, joker, joker.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I know when he was
is in the '50s,

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.260 align:middle line:84%
he used to smoke
cigarette, you know?

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Because I get that [EXHALES].

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And I know that.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much aware
that they would

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.810 align:middle line:90%
have been Camel cigarettes.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's Camel cigarettes
there's just a big camel,

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:04.340 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.506 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And that's why
he had oxygen at the end.

00:39:06.506 --> 00:39:07.974 align:middle line:90%


00:39:07.974 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You got
what you deserved?

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.290 align:middle line:84%
He said-- he goes, I
got what I deserved.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:16.742 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the word lucky
means something-- so L-U-C-K-Y.

00:39:16.742 --> 00:39:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:20.797 align:middle line:84%
It's lucky-- so lucky something,
lucky supermarket, lucky--

00:39:20.797 --> 00:39:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lucky Strikes.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lucky Strikes.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.326 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He smoked those
before he smoked Camels.

00:39:24.326 --> 00:39:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, oh, OK.

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:26.520 align:middle line:90%
How weird, right?

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.665 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also being
shown a baseball mitt.

00:39:29.665 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm being shown a baseball mitt.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to go back to
your childhood with your father,

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.080 align:middle line:84%
would you know anything
about a baseball mitt?

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.063 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you and him played

00:39:37.063 --> 00:39:38.900 align:middle line:84%
throwing games like
throwing a ball?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to go to a memory
of playing catch with you.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And I need to go to a
small park, not a big park.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's a small park.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe
it was New York.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.110 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like I'm
in a small park.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:90%
We're playing catch.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's teaching
me about baseball,

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:84%
little league,
this sort of thing.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.134 align:middle line:90%
And do you remember that?

00:39:55.134 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.760 align:middle line:90%


00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want
you to remember that.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.801 align:middle line:84%
And that's how he wants you
to remember him, that time.

00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:04.756 align:middle line:84%
Because that's very,
very real for him.

00:40:04.756 --> 00:40:05.380 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Very, very real.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he almost lost
his life once, either work

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.920 align:middle line:84%
related, he almost
lost his life.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.370 align:middle line:90%
You know about that.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.010 align:middle line:90%
And he's telling me that he did.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.400 align:middle line:90%
And he was spared.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.260 align:middle line:90%
And he's proud.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Who's Brian, by the way?

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Who's a Brian.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I've got--

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Family,
nephew, or something?

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --a lot of
Brians in the family.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
There must be a
nephew named Brian.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:27.255 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:40:27.255 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's just
giving love to this Brian.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.333 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, Brian's
getting into special work

00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:32.619 align:middle line:90%
or doing something different.

00:40:32.619 --> 00:40:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's a very
special type of work

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:90%
he's getting involved in.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he's definitely

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:90%
guiding him and helping him.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's just about a new
shift in a job, new job,

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:42.832 align:middle line:84%
or doing something
brand new, OK?

00:40:42.832 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And people were like,
ooh, he shouldn't do that

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:90%
or, ooh, this is kind of weird.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:90%
He'll be fine.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.065 align:middle line:90%
He'll be fine.

00:40:47.065 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm gong to leave
you with that, OK?

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:50.976 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much, Greg.

00:40:50.976 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So a very
interesting question people

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
ask all the time-- if I gave
Greg a reading, I give someone

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.962 align:middle line:84%
else a reading, can the
information sometimes be

00:41:00.962 --> 00:41:03.170 align:middle line:84%
for one person other than
the person in the audience.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's very much like
if we're walking down

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.620 align:middle line:90%
the street in a summer day.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's a party going
on in a house over here.

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.357 align:middle line:84%
And what's our first
inclination as we walk by?

00:41:14.357 --> 00:41:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: See what's up.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Look.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to want to look
and see what's going on.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.467 align:middle line:84%
So when you sit here and we
work with the spirit world

00:41:22.467 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and we open up the
portal, lets say, open up

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that doorway to spirit, and they
see that there's an opportunity

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to come through, you bet
they're going to take it.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll try to come through
any way they possibly

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:35.670 align:middle line:84%
can, whether it's through
another person's reading

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and they tag on,
which they do a lot.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to focus
so much on one person.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I like here, trying to hear it.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.890 align:middle line:90%
And I just hear what I hear.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.480 align:middle line:84%
They might jump into
the conversation.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do
is I'd just like to-- I

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.250 align:middle line:84%
know probably a lot of that made
sense to you, this lady here.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:54.170 align:middle line:84%
What I would like to do is to
maybe bring you up on stage

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and do a reading.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Honey, what is your name?

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Janet.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Janet.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Are you OK, Janet?

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I'm fine.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:41:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So a
lot of information

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I was giving for that other
gentlemen, Greg, made sense

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:02.800 align:middle line:90%
to yourself.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.246 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to work
with you a little bit here.

00:42:06.246 --> 00:42:07.890 align:middle line:90%
I know your brother passed over.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a lady that
comes in right here with you.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.954 align:middle line:84%
And you beat yourself up all
the time, she says to me.

00:42:13.954 --> 00:42:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Why do you beat yourself up?

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Why do you beat yourself up?

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lady in the
spirit world that passes over

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:19.765 align:middle line:90%
and I have a heart condition.

00:42:19.765 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a heart-- this
is what brings me

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.417 align:middle line:84%
to the other side of
life, a heart problem.

00:42:23.417 --> 00:42:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, yes.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:24.985 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:42:24.985 --> 00:42:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.043 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I'm not sure if it's

00:42:27.043 --> 00:42:29.470 align:middle line:84%
a mother or mother-in-law
or a grandmother.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.240 align:middle line:90%
But there's something like this.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.279 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It could be both.

00:42:33.279 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, I'm going
to go with my mother-in-law

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:35.940 align:middle line:90%
for right now--

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: OK,
yeah, it makes sense.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --until
I feel that first.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.930 align:middle line:90%
But let's see.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if she was
a compulsive shopper

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.189 align:middle line:90%
and she liked to save things.

00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
loved to save things.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:47.534 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If I
go to her garage,

00:42:47.534 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't I have things in
that garage on the shelves

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.570 align:middle line:84%
of saving, either
groceries, or she

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:84%
would go to one of these
big places for food

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and buy extra stuff.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she would
put that in the garage.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
had a storage unit.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She had
a storage unit, OK.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And do you remember
her-- would you remember?

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you're showing me a
picture of putting these items.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.467 align:middle line:84%
It's like a Smart &
Final or something.

00:43:11.467 --> 00:43:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I go and I get all these
items or groceries or paper

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:84%
products and I
just put them away.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.245 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:43:16.245 --> 00:43:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
makes sense to you.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: --kind of
like bulk shopping.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, yeah bulk
shopping, bulk shopping.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.526 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
I'm an avid shopper.

00:43:22.526 --> 00:43:23.566 align:middle line:90%
I like to do that, OK?

00:43:23.566 --> 00:43:29.244 align:middle line:84%
Can I just tell you that
this lady also, she-- right.

00:43:29.244 --> 00:43:29.744 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:43:29.744 --> 00:43:30.244 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:43:30.244 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.181 align:middle line:90%
She's with her son.

00:43:33.181 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, yes.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh, uh huh.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And when
your brother passes over,

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you that I
know that I'm passing over.

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.110 align:middle line:90%
So he knew he was passing over.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:43.844 align:middle line:84%
And he keeps-- he's
coming this way.

00:43:43.844 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:90%
He knew he was passing over.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's funny because
of the car thing.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Because yes, that
is him with a car.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about you either
taking a picture of him out

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.950 align:middle line:84%
of a frame or redoing
a photograph of him.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.156 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if was
after he passed over

00:43:56.156 --> 00:43:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to redo the photo.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that, please?

00:43:58.740 --> 00:43:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, definitely.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.378 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:44:00.378 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he
wanted you to know that.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So this other lady's helping
him out-- and he'll tell you--

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --helping
the connection to happened.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:06.818 align:middle line:90%
And there's a man there also.

00:44:06.818 --> 00:44:07.960 align:middle line:90%
He'll tell you that.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Go, go, go.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Sports, sports, sports,
sports, sports sports-- OK.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk also about--
yes, yes, go on, go on, go on.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.910 align:middle line:90%
He comes close to me.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.615 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about, I know
when you put the picture there,

00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:20.980 align:middle line:90%
you changed the photograph.

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I know the photograph
that you frame.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.442 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:44:24.442 --> 00:44:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to ask you,
were there two different places

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:84%
that there were funerals
or memorial services?

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Were there two different cities
or two different memorial

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:90%
services, please?

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was just
recognized in another town too.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there was something else
besides the city or town he

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.445 align:middle line:84%
was, somewhere else,
because he said twice, OK?

00:44:40.445 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
when we're younger,

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.976 align:middle line:84%
was there someone--
your parents--

00:44:43.976 --> 00:44:47.580 align:middle line:84%
who drove a Cadillac car or
had a Cadillac or someone?

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It
might have been me

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:90%
in an earlier part of my life.

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wan't
he alive then?

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.507 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yeah.

00:44:55.507 --> 00:44:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And didn't
he see that Cadillac car?

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And weren't
you really happy at the time?

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I was.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.081 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
weren't you happier

00:45:02.081 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:84%
in that time of your life
more than you are now?

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.828 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:04.828 --> 00:45:07.182 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's
telling me that, OK?

00:45:07.182 --> 00:45:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uhuh.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
I know that I want

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.600 align:middle line:84%
to go to that energy in
that lifetime, that time

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.540 align:middle line:84%
in your life, back to
that period of time.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see
how beautifully

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.794 align:middle line:84%
naive, in some ways,
and open you are.

00:45:17.794 --> 00:45:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
was another relationship

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:20.850 align:middle line:90%
at the time in your life.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, uh huh.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he goes on about that

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.040 align:middle line:84%
was the relationship
in your time.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But you were much
more yourself then.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.912 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I got to yell you,

00:45:29.912 --> 00:45:31.620 align:middle line:84%
he's kind of your
guardian angel as well.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:32.480 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Your brother talks to you
all the time in the car.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he does.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:34.970 align:middle line:90%
He does talk to me.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's funny
about the car, because he's

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.580 align:middle line:90%
in that car all the time.

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:38.205 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:38.205 --> 00:45:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who's a July
birthday, July, June, July?

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: June-- my daughter.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, OK.

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I got you.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about two
different relationships.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.790 align:middle line:90%
He wants to go back there.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.272 align:middle line:84%
And if I can go to-- I'm just
bringing what he's giving me.

00:45:55.272 --> 00:45:56.605 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, no, that's fine.

00:45:56.605 --> 00:45:57.410 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.910 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.576 align:middle line:84%

And it happened.

00:46:03.197 --> 00:46:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you've got to
be careful what you wish for.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:06.946 align:middle line:90%

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And she's just
cleaning, cleaning,

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:16.870 align:middle line:90%
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:84%

She wants to clean up the table.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.080 align:middle line:90%

She loves her cleaning things.

00:46:24.921 --> 00:46:25.920 align:middle line:90%
She loves the polishing.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.635 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
she had cleaning days.

00:46:28.635 --> 00:46:29.445 align:middle line:90%
OK, cleaning days.

00:46:29.445 --> 00:46:30.112 align:middle line:90%
I just get that.

00:46:30.112 --> 00:46:31.444 align:middle line:90%
Your brother's tell me this too.

00:46:31.444 --> 00:46:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really true.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.680 align:middle line:90%
When did your mom pass?

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She hasn't.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:84%

OK.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And were you just talking
to her on the phone

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.830 align:middle line:90%
this morning or yesterday?

>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
getting really emotional.

00:46:48.310 --> 00:46:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And would you let
her know she doesn't

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.174 align:middle line:84%
need to feel bad
for him anymore.

00:46:51.174 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, she found him.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.050 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't need to feel
bad for him anymore.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.332 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't cause
this to happen.

00:46:57.332 --> 00:46:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was nothing to
do with her at all.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And he's sorry that she
had to find him that way.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:02.808 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uhuh, I do.

00:47:02.808 --> 00:47:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I got to
tell you, with his passing,

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.640 align:middle line:90%
he didn't suffer.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.922 align:middle line:90%
And it was a build up.

00:47:09.922 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uhuh.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:90%

00:47:11.855 --> 00:47:12.190 align:middle line:90%

>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:13.168 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:47:13.168 --> 00:47:14.962 align:middle line:90%
And I hope people learn from it.

00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.790 align:middle line:84%
He said he was not
going to-- he was

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.630 align:middle line:90%
going to go before they would.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't handle it.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.932 align:middle line:90%
So-- Yeah.

00:47:21.932 --> 00:47:22.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get
into the details,

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.346 align:middle line:90%
because we know the details.

00:47:25.346 --> 00:47:26.130 align:middle line:90%
No reason to.

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:28.955 align:middle line:84%
But would you please
tell Mom I love her.

00:47:28.955 --> 00:47:30.479 align:middle line:90%
And please--

00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Be happy too.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.460 align:middle line:90%
I would be happy too.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'll
leave you with that.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, honey.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:34.703 align:middle line:90%
You're very welcome.

00:47:34.703 --> 00:47:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.547 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was very nice.

00:47:37.547 --> 00:47:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very, very much.

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, everybody,
for taking part in today.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that you go away now
with maybe a different sense

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.320 align:middle line:84%
of awareness about who you
are, your own power within,

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.080 align:middle line:84%
your own sense of
knowingness, and know

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.399 align:middle line:90%
that the truth is right here.

00:47:51.399 --> 00:47:52.190 align:middle line:90%
It's in your heart.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:54.273 align:middle line:84%
When you come to the right
space, the right place,

00:47:54.273 --> 00:47:57.020 align:middle line:84%
it will always develop
and manifest in your life.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you think love, be
love, you will have love.

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.840 align:middle line:90%
So please remember that.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.027 align:middle line:84%
And until I see you again,
love and light to all of you.

00:48:05.027 --> 00:48:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all so very much.
