00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: And
now, world renowned

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.975 align:middle line:90%
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:32.634 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:33.884 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:35.868 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you at home for watching
"Spirit Talk," where I take you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:90%
one step closer to heaven.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.827 align:middle line:84%
And I've come on stage
today, and I'm holding this.

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, what are these?

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wasn't using them
per se, but in a way I was.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:90%
So these are rosary beads.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So today's show is
really about religion.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.551 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
religion, something

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
which has touched every
single person, probably,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
on this earth, in
one way or another.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And around times
now we're living in,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
it's touching people more
than ever in some respects.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So I borrowed these from
a guest from our audience.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.242 align:middle line:90%
And where are you?

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Ah, here you are.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very, very much.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Where did you receive these?

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We made a trip
and went to the Vatican.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.803 align:middle line:84%
So they were purchased
at the Vatican.

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:90%
I was at the Vatican once.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And do you use the rosary beads?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, very much.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And so you
were raised Catholic?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I was raised Catholic as well.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.932 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to be a
priest, which a lot of people

00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:84%
might not know that I
was going to be a priest.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.296 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:38.084 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:84%
How many other people grew up
Catholic, in that tradition?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot of people.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
And other religions?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.031 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Jewish?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.155 align:middle line:90%
Are you Jewish?

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Jewish people.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Any other religions?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Eastern religions?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Baha'i.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Pardon?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Baha'i.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.685 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Baha'i.

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love Baha'i.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.950 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I went to Baha'i in Israel,
Baha'i, the Temple of Baha'i.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I love all religions.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.905 align:middle line:90%
I love all religions.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.989 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
share with you this hour,

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you about
religion, because it's

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
such an important
part of our society.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And I want to hold these.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to give
them away to you.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.488 align:middle line:84%
But I will give them back
to you, I do promise.

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:13.184 align:middle line:90%
I'll give them back to you now.

00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:17.246 align:middle line:90%
[GROANS] They feel so nice.

00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
They feel really
warm, and I like that.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.630 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So religion to me, people often
ask me, what is your religion?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to say to them.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Because from the work that
I've done in the past 30 years,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
the spirit world,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
spirit will often
say to me, well,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
when you think of
religion, that is really

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
a construct of the three
dimensional human world.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
But religion, per se, doesn't
exist here where we are.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
We have many, many, many,
many, many, many, many

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:84%
different types of religions,
or belief systems, can I say.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Belief systems.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that religions-- and
I don't want to upset anybody,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
but-- not that I mean
to-- but I certainly

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
hope it creates you to
think, maybe, differently.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.720 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
what it is about.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
In that, I think most
religions are man made.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I think many, many
religions are human made.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that they
stem from tradition,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
so traditional types of things,
society, societies people

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:90%
lived in.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I think many religions
became very political,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and that the society and
religion came together

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to form-- I hate to say it--
politics, land ownership,

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:90%
so forth.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
A belief system brought
people together culturally.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
People could relate to
each other on that level.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
all religions are

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
great if they do what
they're meant to do.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So I also have in
my pocket beads.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So these are from a
Buddhist tradition, beads.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So what makes my beads
different than your beads?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Nothing at all.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.803 align:middle line:84%
The same material-- well,
it's different material,

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:90%
but the same thing.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the
thought behind the beads.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think beads, I love
these and prayer beads, yes.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
What prayer for me does, it
just brings you into center.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It brings you into
your heart space.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I think all religions' job,
what they're meant for,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:84%
is to really bring
you back to source.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a Jewish tradition,
whether it's a Hindu tradition,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
Catholic tradition,

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.539 align:middle line:90%
it brings you back to God.

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it is.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And going back to God
is going back to source.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Going back to God is going back
to the oneness of who you are.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier,
I was raised Catholic

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.220 align:middle line:84%
in a Catholic family, and that
was a tradition of our family

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
from generations,
generations, generations back.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have to be very,
very careful as human beings

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that we don't own God, and that
we don't feel we can own God.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't think anybody owns God.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't think one person's God
is better than another God.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I think God is all the same.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.916 align:middle line:90%
I think you're all God.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I think you're all
God, because you all

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:90%
have that beautiful light.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Every one of you.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful green
light from your heart.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:90%
That's God.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
God stays in the
heart, the soul.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So any religion or
tradition or practice,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
whether it's mindfulness,
whether it's meditation,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
whether it's prayer-- wherever
you place a thought to bring

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.860 align:middle line:84%
you back to source,
the tradition.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Even, you could
say, a crystal ball.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:90%
You could say tarot cards.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:84%
All different-- Ouija boards.
[GASP] Ouija boards, huh?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:90%
See that belief system.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever instrument you use
to bring you back to source

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:90%
is all you need.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.585 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
you're thinking,

00:05:37.585 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
what you have connecting the
thought of what that energy is

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.455 align:middle line:90%
with that instrument.

00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
For instance, people
talk about Ouija boards.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.427 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know.

00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And I am from the
Catholic background,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
where we went that is the
devil's work. [GROANS]

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing the devil's
work up here. [GROANS]

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:90%
If you believed in the devil.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.281 align:middle line:84%
But any instrument that you
use, whether it's a rosary bead,

00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:58.405 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a Ouija board,
whether it's a crystal,

00:05:58.405 --> 00:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it's-- whatever
way, whether it's looking

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
at a wonderful painting of
Jesus, or Muhammad, or Buddha,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It's really the thought, if that
brings you into source of love.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
If you enter with
a source of love,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:84%
you have to respect any
instrument, anything.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So, whether-- And respect
all different traditions

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and religions.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that, and
as the spirit world has

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:84%
said to me many,
many times, that I

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.640 align:middle line:84%
wish the human race
could celebrate

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the diversity of each
person's religion,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
not just one religion.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:90%
But celebrate the diversity.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Because God is so
diverse in the design.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
They've often showed
me a snowflake.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And they said, James,
every snowflake is unique.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Every snowflake is beautiful
in its own make up.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You put them all together,
what does it form?

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:90%
A beautiful landscape.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:90%
A beautiful design.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
something, if we could just

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
put that out to the-- people
that are watching this, and all

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
of you, whether you believe
in that, what I say or not,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.260 align:middle line:90%
that's fine.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Just let a seed sit
with you to resonate.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to be careful
that we don't mix up

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:90%
traditions with religion.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.202 align:middle line:90%
Two different things, you know?

00:07:10.202 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I come from New York, so
it's Italian Jewish, mostly,

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
people there, and
I relate to that.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot
of it for me, also,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
can incorporate the
ceremonial part of it.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I love the ceremonial
part of it.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And that could be from
past life experiences,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
where I was-- I studied all
different types of religions.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.867 align:middle line:84%
Every religion has
a bit of the truth.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Every religion has
a bit of the truth.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But not any one religion
has all the truth.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So when people often ask
me, what is your religion,

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
I say, my religion, if
I had to say, is love.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Love is my religion.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Love is my religion.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't limit God with
words or doctrine.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't limit God.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I will say that religion
of love, in its own way,

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
has certain tenets
you should abide by,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
which is treat
another person as God.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.909 align:middle line:84%
You treat them as you
want to be treated.

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Because you are the same.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:90%
We are one connection.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So why would you treat them
any differently than yourself?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:84%
By treating someone else bad,
you're treating yourself bad.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:90%
You're hurting yourself as well.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's really, really
the way it should be.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It's pure.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, in saying that to you,
it's very much in your mind.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
The spirit is the mind.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The mind is spirit,
spirit's mind.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.744 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes when people pass
to the world of the spirit,

00:08:27.744 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
when they leave
the physical body,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
they will bring with
them their mindset,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
their soul is part
of that mindset.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So their belief system
stays with them.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:84%
The memories they created on
the Earth stays with them.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
So I have had many times where
I have brought spirit back

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.522 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh, I'm still
going to church over here.

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm still going
to a mosque here.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.011 align:middle line:84%
And I've said, oh, that's
a very interesting thing.

00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well
that works for me here.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
level that I'm at,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and there are many, many
levels in the spirit world.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
You go to level
which you believe,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:90%
which your mindset is in.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.850 align:middle line:84%
They've come back
here and said, I

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.099 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe in this sort
of thing when I was alive.

00:09:04.099 --> 00:09:05.305 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do it now?

00:09:05.305 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
with the mind.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
You have to always have an
open mind, not a closed mind.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to-- I
believe on this human earth,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.675 align:middle line:84%
our schoolroom here, that we're
here to learn and take classes.

00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a schoolroom
we came back to.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:90%
This is the Earth schoolroom.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're here to learn
many, many lessons.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I think if we come in
with a prefixed idea,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:84%
or closed mindedness,
that we're not

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
open to learning many
things from everyone else,

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:90%
then we're cynical.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:90%
We're cynics.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sense
of cynicism, which

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
means that your mind is
closed, and you're not

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.950 align:middle line:90%
open to learning anything.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, I think, well, what
a waste of time on this school

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Earth, when you can't
open up your mind

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
to different ways of
looking at things.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very interesting.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I've had that
experience with my work,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
as you'd imagine, doing
this for a very long time.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
spirit communication,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't the in thing.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
There was no
Theresa Caputo then.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And there really weren't
shows or anything.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.821 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the first
ones out there doing this.

00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember very
clearly, I had many people

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:90%
used to think I was crazy.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.989 align:middle line:84%
They wanted-- they'd give
me cards for some therapist,

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:09.185 align:middle line:84%
to go see a therapist,
some asylum,

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:13.326 align:middle line:84%
and go visit more
people like you there.

00:10:13.326 --> 00:10:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And if I wasn't open
minded, I probably

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:15.949 align:middle line:90%
would've ended up there.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But I'm open minded, because
I'm aware of that God power.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:90%
The God power, the God energy.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we can learn a lot
from each other's traditions,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
and I love that.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much a person who
is-- as I get more in my work,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I respect all the
traditions, and I pull out

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
things that make sense to
me, that I feel connected to.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's so funny.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
I've seen hundreds and
hundreds of religions,

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and they all have
the basic same thing.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:90%
It's really true.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So, just my advice.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't try to own God.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:90%
We can't own God; we are God.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about love.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Don't let man and
mankind, humankind,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.409 align:middle line:90%
get in the power of that.

00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:90%
You cannot own God.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.037 align:middle line:90%
They like the power of that.

00:10:58.037 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's
unfortunate, because they

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
can lead people who
are weak-minded astray.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It's so much easier giving
up your responsibility

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:90%
to someone else.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a religion, a
belief system, someone else,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.444 align:middle line:84%
than to take
responsibility for self.

00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
When you pass to
the spirit world,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to be
standing next to you.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.948 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be standing
by yourself, looking back

00:11:18.948 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:90%
at the life you just lived.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.590 align:middle line:90%
How did you believe?

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.412 align:middle line:90%
What did you think?

00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
What did you do
with the time here?

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Did you complete-- did you
provide compassion, hope,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:90%
generosity, honesty?

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Did you help
another human being?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:90%
They don't care about religion.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
What did you do inside of
your heart with another human?

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
We are very blessed
today, because we

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:90%
have two incredible beings here.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Friends of mine.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And one is a friend who's
a traditional shaman,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and shaman using
the four elements.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
bring her, she's

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
going to do a little
ceremony for us.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And the other incredible
being is her baby, and kind

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.419 align:middle line:84%
of my baby, kind
of adopted baby,

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:84%
who I always have the
pleasure of taking care of,

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and I renamed the baby, and it's
a-- because that's what I do.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And we connected.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Karen,
she's a shaman,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and she has a beautiful
dog named Amber.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And Amber's a service dog.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.572 align:middle line:84%
And Amber is a dog
who, again, don't

00:12:17.572 --> 00:12:19.405 align:middle line:84%
get me started with
animals, because I could

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.696 align:middle line:90%
do a whole show on the animals.

00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We will, but animals are
wonderful examples or samples

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%
So this is Karen.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Would you?

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Karen.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Karen Ahwat.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:31.899 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Karen.

00:12:31.899 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Hi, James.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And where's Amber?

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:90%
She's back there somewhere.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: This is Amber--
you taking a nap?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.331 align:middle line:90%
You want to go see James?

00:12:36.331 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's go see James.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, sweetheart.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Just let me pet you and say hi.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.241 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Up you go.

00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, sweetheart.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.765 align:middle line:90%
Want to give me your paw?

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Want to sit?

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.826 align:middle line:90%
Give me your paw?

00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:49.704 align:middle line:90%
Give me your paw.

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Double shake.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.745 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Double shake.

00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Oh, all right.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.972 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Oh, a single shake.

00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Amber is great, because
Amber had cancer,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and Amber's healed
herself from cancer.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And also Karen assisted
with her shamanic work.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.259 align:middle line:90%
So Karen, come on up.

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Thank you.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Have
a seat, darling.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.548 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Appreciate it.

00:13:08.548 --> 00:13:09.067 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Have a seat.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.066 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
talk to you a little bit,

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people might not

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.814 align:middle line:84%
know about shamanism
and that tradition.

00:13:15.814 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it would be
a great experience for you

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to share what you know,
and your knowledge,

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:90%
and this native tradition.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Thank you.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So shamanism exists in North
America, South America,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Mongolia-- it's
all over the world.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism is about
getting right with you.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of key principles.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
One of is-- one of
them is that you

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
work at all four levels:
your spiritual level,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
your mental level,
your emotional level,

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:90%
and your physical level.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hold
on one second.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot, right?

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So, you talk about
integrating all four?

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: It's about integrating
and balancing those, and coming

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
into right relationship
with those.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism is very
experiential, so it

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.360 align:middle line:84%
means feeling your feelings,
not dismissing them.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:84%
It means knowing
your mental stories.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
It means listening to your
body and what it's telling you.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Because your spirit will talk
to you through your body.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about using the elements
and the energies of nature,

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:90%
and the principles of nature.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:90%
So make--

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: To bring
back a healing or balance

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.722 align:middle line:90%
in each part of those bodies.

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Correct.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.599 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes, we're out
of sync with ourselves

00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:20.140 align:middle line:84%
because those bodies
are out of sync,

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:84%
because we're not listening when
our spirit is talking to us.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Or
they're imbalanced.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Like a lot of people
emotionally get imbalanced,

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.415 align:middle line:84%
when someone does you you wrong,
or you lost a relationship,

00:14:27.415 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
or you have a loved
one that's passed over.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.851 align:middle line:84%
Many times that just
really hurts them,

00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and they can be imbalanced
emotionally, correct?

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Right.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.245 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
feel it physically.

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:90%
You get upset about something.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
You start getting very
depressed and very discouraged.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So all of those bodies
are very connected.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
to nature, nature's

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.550 align:middle line:84%
in right relationship
with itself.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's always in balance,
unless, of course,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.322 align:middle line:90%
man intervenes and messes it up.

00:14:49.322 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The human
always gets in the way.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.738 align:middle line:84%
Always gets in the
way, that human.

00:14:52.738 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: But in and of itself,
it is in right relationship.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So shamanism is about working
with your mental bodies,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
your emotional body,
your physical body.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you can,
go back to nature.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Go for a walk around a lake.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Go sit with a tree,
a tree's roots.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever seen a tree
that's leaning over to the side,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and big tree branches
stretching out?

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, those roots are tight.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:90%
They're strong.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:84%
That tree knows who it
is, and it takes a lot.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
We have 100-year-old trees that
take huge winds to knock down,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:90%
because they're so well rooted.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
That's our job as humans,
is to get our rooting.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.734 align:middle line:84%
To come back to our
center, our core.

00:15:32.734 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So true.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I teach that in all
my classes, too.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.194 align:middle line:84%
Because I find
that people who do

00:15:37.194 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
spiritual work, not
everyone, of course,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of my students,
I find that many times

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:84%
they think that they
have to be in the head.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They've got to be here all the
time, they've got to be here.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.575 align:middle line:84%
This is where the power--
when the powers is really

00:15:47.575 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth mother,
and in the heart

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and integration of all that.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's saying the
same thing we think--

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
a lot of religious
belief systems

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.681 align:middle line:84%
say the same thing
with different words,

00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:90%
different phrases.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.055 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Right.

00:15:58.055 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism is completely
compatible with any religion.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
an enhancement.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And let's say somebody is
imbalanced or not equalizing

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.504 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, what
kind of cerem--

00:16:07.504 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
do you do a ceremony for
that sort of a thing?

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.597 align:middle line:90%
What would you do?

00:16:10.597 --> 00:16:12.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: I would first--
I would tell them--

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You would do an
assessment first, probably.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: --two things.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I would do an
assessment with them,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
and I would bring
to consciousness.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
step, is awareness.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:90%
And then it becomes choice.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Do I choose to bring in more
balance and more harmony?

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.018 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
let's say someone,

00:16:25.018 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, they
lost their husband,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and they really
can't get over that.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And you meet them,
and you feel, or you

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
intuit that they're not healing
because of this loss, which

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is normal, we just, we
have to live with that.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course we can
never get over it.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But how would you work
with that emotional thing?

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.336 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: I would sit
with them, and have

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.820 align:middle line:90%
them sit in their sadness.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I would really take
them into their sadness.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Because you must
feel your feelings.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:90%
That's where the power is.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:90%
The power's not in our minds.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:84%
As a cerebral society, we
think the power is up here.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:90%
No, the power's in your heart.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.887 align:middle line:84%
So I would sit with that
person, I would say let's cry.

00:17:00.887 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And I would sit with them.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we sat for an hour,
and they cried, fabulous.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.390 align:middle line:84%
If they came back the next
time-- be with your feelings.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Feel them.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to flow like a river.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:84%
A river that gets
dammed up becomes

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
stagnant and murky and
dirty and unhealthy.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:90%
But a river that flows.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
feeling sad, be sad.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:90%
Cry.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
And if people tell you,
oh, don't be-- no, no, no.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:90%
You be sad.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:90%
You be in that sadness.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:84%
And you feel it for as
long as you need to.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's really
interesting, you saying this.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as all of
you know, things

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.967 align:middle line:84%
happen we call
coincidence, right?

00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Where we hear something
the same time three times,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.860 align:middle line:84%
the weirdest thing,
the most obscure thing

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.712 align:middle line:84%
you could hear three times in
one day, or through the week.

00:17:40.712 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Something very
interesting just happened.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.045 align:middle line:84%
It happens all the
time with my groups,

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:90%
my audiences, my groups.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Where a message comes
through, and they're

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:90%
crying their eyes out.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:48.966 align:middle line:90%
Crying their eyes out.

00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, I think
tears cleanse the soul.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Very much.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.016 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
a friend of mine

00:17:53.016 --> 00:17:55.350 align:middle line:84%
was in the audience helping
around with a microphone,

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and this was a-- I
think it was in Europe.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:57.893 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it was.

00:17:57.893 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And the people are
crying and crying.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm, like, mouthing get
a Kleenex to that person.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking at me, and
she's very slowly walking.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, why is
she slowly walking?

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And she told me later on, she
said-- I said, why didn't you,

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Peggy, go to that
person right away?

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:90%
She goes, oh, no.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.986 align:middle line:90%
I had to let them process that.

00:18:16.986 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And if I broke that
process with the Kleenex,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.972 align:middle line:84%
it would have broken
the whole process.

00:18:20.972 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.725 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing, kind of.

00:18:23.725 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Right.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.197 align:middle line:90%
And be with your emotions.

00:18:26.197 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're angry about
something, don't take it out

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
on someone else,
because it's about being

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:90%
in right relationship with you.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not about anybody else.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the circumstances
or the other person.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
What are you angry
about with yourself?

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Get clear with yourself.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're taking
responsibility for yourself.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Right.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
get your power back.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's where you want--

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:46.772 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can
I-- I just want

00:18:46.772 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:84%
to jump something in
with you if I could.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Just dovetailing here.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.127 align:middle line:84%
When I read people
energetically, same thing.

00:18:52.127 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
If someone has bad
thoughts, they're sort of

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
holding on to something,
in the auric field

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.394 align:middle line:90%
you'll see a dirtiness there.

00:18:58.394 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:90%
You'll see a weakness there.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
You'll see that it's not very
strong, that seal around them.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And if that stays
like that, it'll

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
end up manifesting
somewhere in the physical.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So it first starts with
thought, the mental,

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.585 align:middle line:90%
and eventually ends up physical.

00:19:10.585 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Right.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And the physical is
the most dense level.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the literal level.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the last level to change.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So it goes spiritual,
or energetic

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is the lightest, that's the--
if you will, your blueprint.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.825 align:middle line:84%
The next lightest
level is mental,

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts, your
stories you create.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The next level below that, which
is heavier, are the emotions.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
We all know how we feel.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.370 align:middle line:84%
If you get sad, or you're
upset, or you're frustrated,

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:90%
it's intense.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the final level
is the physical level.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.662 align:middle line:90%
And it will manifest.

00:19:36.662 --> 00:19:40.344 align:middle line:84%
So you can see, if you can
see them as flowing together,

00:19:40.344 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:84%
you can seek
relationship, and you

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
can start to work with
your own life and say, OK.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:84%
How do I put myself
back into balance?

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And, as I say, the first step
is always go into nature.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Because nature itself
holds a high vibration.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And just being in
a higher vibration

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
will help lift you up
and bring you clarity.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.825 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
when-- so everyone here

00:19:58.825 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:84%
in the audience, and people that
are watching this-- when you

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
feel you want to connect
back with yourself,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:90%
just go into nature.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Is there something they can
do once they get into nature?

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Sit under a tree,
what do they do then?

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:07.783 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Absolutely.

00:20:07.783 --> 00:20:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you are
in your context.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
A tree, a river, engage into,
if you will, a silent space.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:90%
A meditative space.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Or if you need to move,
sometimes walking around.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.510 align:middle line:90%
But let your mind go still.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.704 align:middle line:84%
I meet so many people
who I work with, oh, I

00:20:21.704 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%
walk around the river.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well,
what are you thinking

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
about when you walk
around the river?

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.905 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm working about
my work project,

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:90%
and I'm working about this.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.579 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:28.272 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:28.272 --> 00:20:29.105 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Mm-mm.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: You're spinning.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into nature, you
want to be as calm as you can,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:90%
as quiet.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Take the iPod ear pods out.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And see if you can tune into
the vibration of the tree.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Sit with the tree.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Stand with the tree.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
Put your hand on it.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Look at the river, notice--
or the ocean, if you can.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:90%
Notice the ebb and the flow.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Notice the movement.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:90%
Notice a running river.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: We're all
connected to it anyway.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:90%
We're a part of that, aren't we?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: That is who we are.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And that holds a
higher vibration.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get
out to nature, depending

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.727 align:middle line:84%
upon where you're living
and the time of year,

00:21:03.727 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:90%
get on the internet.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.396 align:middle line:90%
Look at a picture.

00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Bring that up on your
screen and sit with it.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and
be the still pond.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Because, you see, if
you're a turbulent ocean,

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and spirit drops
a pebble in, you

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:90%
can't tell what's happening.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.143 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's true.

00:21:17.143 --> 00:21:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: But if you're still
pond and spirit drops that

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
pebble, you go, oh, that's
the clarity I was looking for.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:26.877 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's the
direction I want to go.

00:21:26.877 --> 00:21:27.710 align:middle line:90%
But we're turbulent.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:90%
We're a turbulent ocean.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So go as still as
you can with nature,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.297 align:middle line:84%
and be present in the
present energy of nature.

00:21:35.297 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's great advice.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.463 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted one more
thing to add to that.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
When I've done that, and we
walk-- take the dogs for walks.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
We take dogs for walks.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.834 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- when
I go in nature,

00:21:45.834 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I become much more aware of
doing this after a mindfulness

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.921 align:middle line:90%
class.

00:21:49.921 --> 00:21:52.045 align:middle line:84%
That every step that I
take, the bottom of my feet,

00:21:52.045 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I connected with the ground.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.150 align:middle line:84%
That there's an intention
there, and I'm just connecting.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, you
do that for a little bit,

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.145 align:middle line:90%
you'll get used to it.

00:21:59.145 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Right.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And you can build on that.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And as a tree takes in
nutrients and releases waste,

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:84%
as you walk with each step, I'm
taking in the nutrients I need.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I have all the answers
I'm looking for.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm releasing those
stories and the pain

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and the suffering that
no longer serves me.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Like a tree will root, root
yourself with each step

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:90%
as you're walking.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
great, that's great.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
How many years have
you been doing this?

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: About 10 years.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 10 years.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.843 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any questions
for Karen and shamanism,

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and her work, at all,
any procedures, anybody?

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:90%
You have a question?

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, would you mind standing?

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lisa Marshall.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:30.776 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi Lisa.

00:22:30.776 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:90%
What's your question?

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.148 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I was
just curious what

00:22:33.148 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
your training and your
background in shamanism is.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: So I've
studied with the Incas,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:90%
the Inca descendants.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.466 align:middle line:84%
So I went down to Peru and
worked with the shamans there

00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:41.965 align:middle line:90%
extensively.

00:22:41.965 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've continued to
study here while I can.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I also like to learn
about the Mongolian shamanism.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been over
that area, but I

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:84%
like to bring in-- as James
was talking about in religion,

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:90%
it's really all the same.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at it through
different glasses, if you will.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.473 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I thought it would
be really, really great if we

00:23:00.473 --> 00:23:02.960 align:middle line:84%
would have Karen open
up the space for us,

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
open up this wonderful
healing space,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:84%
and create a doorway for
the spirit world to come in.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And to work with them and invite
them in, in her own tradition.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be fun?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So we'll let Karen
explain how to do that,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.722 align:middle line:84%
and after she's done,
then we'll begin.

00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: So what
I'm going to do is

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk through
what's called the medicine

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
wheel, which means I'm going
to address each of the four

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.300 align:middle line:84%
directions, as well
as above and below.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
primary tenets of shamanism.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Ahem.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And each direction
holds medicine

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:90%
and guidance and wisdom.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
invoke and invite

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:84%
those spirits and those
energies to come in and be

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:90%
with us today.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And also to be with all of you,
for whatever you're seeking

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking
for in your lives.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So that as you go and
you leave the studio

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and you go on about your
day, and on about your life

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:84%
in the next coming weeks,
that you have the opportunity

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
to work with them
if you so desire.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.362 align:middle line:84%
The medicine wheel is about
journeying with the self

00:23:57.362 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
through the different
layers of the self.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And as you'll hear as
I invoke the spirits,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.734 align:middle line:84%
it's a neverending spiral
of growth and awareness.

00:24:05.734 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
what can they do

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:90%
while you're doing the ceremony?

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.611 align:middle line:90%
What can they do in their part?

00:24:09.611 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Can they just be open
and sending love?

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Would that be opening
up the space with love?

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAREN: I would say
be open your hearts.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And open your hearts
to your guides,

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:90%
to your spirit partners.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Particularly those nature
spirits who are with you.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
As James has
mentioned many times,

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:90%
everyone has spirit partners.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has someone,
has many spirits,

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
guiding them and holding
them in their grace.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
You have spirits who are with
you who are nature spirits, who

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
are animal spirits, in
all different forms.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would say open your heart
and say, yes, I receive you in.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not ready to open
your heart, that's fine too.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Be with that and
say, I would like

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to learn and listen
and understand

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
how this different
tradition works.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So come from the place
that you're comfortable,

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and if you can, a
really open heart.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it will stay with you in
the days and weeks to come.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:57.815 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Take your time.

00:24:57.815 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KAREN: Yes, I will.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I will be addressing each
of the four directions.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.396 align:middle line:84%
So you are welcome to,
if you will, kind of look

00:25:03.396 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
towards the direction
that I'm looking,

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:90%
to help invite those spirits in.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'll go through south,
west, north, and east,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll look
above and below.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.202 align:middle line:90%
Are you living or dead?

00:30:25.202 --> 00:30:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel a sense
of emotion there?

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:28.550 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:30.945 align:middle line:84%
You're all, like,
out of it already.

00:30:30.945 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:84%
That was very
powerful, very strong.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.646 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:33.646 --> 00:30:34.146 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:34.146 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.335 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So as that was happening, I
was blending, too, with them.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to continue now
with the spirit communication.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to start now.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
opening the portal.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I have a young man
here who passed over,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and I feel like his picture's
in somebody's wallet.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.113 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it's a
parent that's sitting here,

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like a boy
would have passed over,

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.593 align:middle line:84%
and you'd be sitting with-- oh,
you have his picture with you.

00:30:53.593 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Am I over here?

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it you?

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother
just passed away.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
brother passed.

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:57.869 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:57.869 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:90%
We-- and what is your name?

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.425 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lucia.

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lucia.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if
I-- I think I'm here,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.680 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not 100% sure.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:90%
So let me stay with that.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But I know that there'd be--
is there somebody else in here

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.610 align:middle line:84%
who'd have a photograph of
a young man in their wallet.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Would it be a son, or be
a grandson, or nephew.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.110 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Brother.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I want to go-- see,
I'm not sure yet.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:90%
So let me just see.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk about,
died of his own cause,

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.541 align:middle line:90%
or his own-- right here.

00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Died of his own way.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Suicide of some
kind or of a drug--

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if it was a
drug overdose or something,

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:90%
but there's something like that.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.060 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.991 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm here.

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:33.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm with you then.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just-- would
you mind standing.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, and
your name, again, is--

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:37.955 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lucia.

00:31:37.955 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lucia.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Lucia, thank you for being
here, because your brother--

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
it would be your
brother then, yes?

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so interested, because
I feel I'm with your daddy

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:45.850 align:middle line:90%
here, as well.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like your
father-- you're

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.120 align:middle line:84%
father's still living here
on the Earth, is that right?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I just feel
like I'm here for your father

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So your brother comes in
for your father as well.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So I need you to be the
medium for your father.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And please tell him,
Dad, I didn't mean this.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.199 align:middle line:84%
Please tell Dad not
to take it personally.

00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I get very emotional here.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.835 align:middle line:84%
And please tell Dad that
he's been praying the rosary.

00:32:03.835 --> 00:32:05.197 align:middle line:90%
You had a rosary before.

00:32:05.197 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:90%
He's been praying with a rosary.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.920 align:middle line:90%
He very much connected.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very Catholic.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's so
interesting, because I

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.111 align:middle line:90%
borrowed a rosary before.

00:32:12.111 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Now I know why.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.637 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he's
praying to his son.

00:32:15.637 --> 00:32:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I know Christopher,
Saint Christopher,

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.120 align:middle line:90%
is very significant.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Christopher.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that his name?

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when he
shows me Saint Christopher,

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.010 align:middle line:90%
that's very significant.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I know he has that.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:28.334 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Dad has also been
praying to Saint Christopher.

00:32:28.334 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So would you please ask your
Dad-- if you don't know this,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that there's either
a statue there--

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and notice how I'm getting
here, very emotional.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.366 align:middle line:84%
Remember before I just started,
I said I'm very emotional.

00:32:36.366 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:90%
They're lining up, OK?

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So would you let him know,
he didn't mean to do this.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But I know that your brother
has had many incarnations,

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and I know there's always
been a situation, a lesson

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:84%
for his soul, about learning
about loving himself.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.610 align:middle line:90%
And not feeling self-worth.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.068 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm
very aware of that.

00:32:54.068 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that your
mother is very upset as well.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that she's--
is she not here today?

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.945 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's-- he
has a different mother,

00:33:01.945 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:90%
but she is very upset.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's very upset.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You speak with her,
too, don't you though?

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for writing a letter.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
writing something to me.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.335 align:middle line:84%
So you must have written
something for Christopher,

00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say about a
funeral or a ceremony there.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.044 align:middle line:84%
I think there must have been
his coffin or something there.

00:33:20.044 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Understand that.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I walk into this place,
and they have a coffin here.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a wake type
of thing, I should say.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's very--
there are flowers, like,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing red, blue, white,
different colored carnations.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:32.377 align:middle line:90%
Carnations.

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:90%
A lot of carnations.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.902 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily
roses, carnations.

00:33:34.902 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Both.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Both.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.035 align:middle line:90%
But the carnations are big.

00:33:37.035 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:90%
So carnations from the family.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I know there's some kind
of medals pinned on here.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Pinned on here.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I know I have a
cross, big cross,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the coffin.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I see two candles there as well.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.157 align:middle line:84%
I see letters are all
through the coffin.

00:33:51.157 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So people must have put
some letters inside there.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Would you know if there was a--
he's talking about being goofy.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.890 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like goofy.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.015 align:middle line:84%
He's like this, and he
has an oversized shirt on.

00:34:00.015 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not like hip hopper, but
it's a big, oversized shirt

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:03.359 align:middle line:90%
type of thing.

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And it has some
strange saying on it.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He's like
a skater kind of--

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A skater dude.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.521 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:34:08.521 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:84%
The hat-- skater dude-- the hat
to the side, big old t-shirt,

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.055 align:middle line:90%
I know that he had a ring.

00:34:14.055 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I know he had several rings.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.725 align:middle line:90%
I know his mom has a ring.

00:34:16.725 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:84%
I know Dad wanted to
keep a belt of his,

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:90%
so he has a belt of his.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.949 align:middle line:84%
I know that he had shoes
that did not fit him.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:23.020 align:middle line:90%
This is very interesting.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.353 align:middle line:84%
Because there are shoes still
that exist, he said to me,

00:34:25.353 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and they're one size, one
and a half size too big.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He always
put a roll of socks

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.495 align:middle line:90%
stuffed inside the toe.

00:34:32.495 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:35.011 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:37.220 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:37.719 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's very good
evidence, you see.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Very good evidence.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.199 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, I
know he experiments

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:84%
with different types of
drugs and this sort of thing.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:46.830 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And I feel for him,
because I don't

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.769 align:middle line:84%
feel he loves
himself, really has

00:34:51.769 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:90%
that relationship with himself.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's always
trying to get away

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.331 align:middle line:90%
from having to think who he is.

00:34:55.331 --> 00:34:57.305 align:middle line:84%
And I know the drugs
and the alcohol-- first

00:34:57.305 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
he tells to me he had an
alcohol problem earlier,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.450 align:middle line:90%
before the drugs.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
there's music here as well.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if he wanted
to talk to someone in music,

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:84%
if his friend's in
music, with the MC thing.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to say
that it might be a DJ.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.225 align:middle line:84%
He said, he's a
friend who's a DJ.

00:35:12.225 --> 00:35:13.100 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of that.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He has a
friend that's a DJ.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hm.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I want you to know
about the MC connection there.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.720 align:middle line:90%
It's in quote, quote, MC, OK?

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you
for talking to me.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
must be four people.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.990 align:middle line:90%
There must be four.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:84%
He must be one of four,
or there's four siblings.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Four.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's one of four,
or there are four siblings?

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's
four siblings.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Four siblings.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.650 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So he's one, there are four.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what he's saying to me.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So would you tell
the four siblings

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
that this will not
happen to them.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.715 align:middle line:84%
I know someone just went
to get a tattoo of him.

00:35:41.715 --> 00:35:43.200 align:middle line:90%
You understand about that?

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My cousin wanted
to get a tattoo of him.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just recently.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that, great.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.871 align:middle line:84%
I know that he's very,
very kind with birds

00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:50.551 align:middle line:84%
and dogs and animals
of all kinds.

00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All animals.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All
animals of all kinds.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I know when he was
younger, he tells me,

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:84%
seven years of age,
eight years of age,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.980 align:middle line:90%
his teeth were not straightened.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't like his
teeth weren't straight.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.378 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know if
he wanted to get braces,

00:36:01.378 --> 00:36:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I had to get braces, but
something's uneven here.

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.146 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:36:04.146 --> 00:36:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He has bad teeth.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Bad teeth, right.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But I know that seven
years, eight years of age,

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.853 align:middle line:84%
he's talking to me about this
is-- he doesn't like that.

00:36:09.853 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:84%
That starts him on
his bad self-image.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:12.740 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.260 align:middle line:84%
There's always a reason, you
connect with the dots there.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.570 align:middle line:90%
So I have to go with that.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say, please
give love to his father.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.321 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that we had
Karen here talking about this

00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:24.240 align:middle line:84%
before, because things
are always connected.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.350 align:middle line:90%
His father's suffering.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.909 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't want his
father suffering.

00:36:26.909 --> 00:36:28.450 align:middle line:84%
The father's getting
to a point right

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:31.670 align:middle line:84%
now-- did his father-- does
his father smoke cigarettes?

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.889 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Marijuana.

00:36:32.889 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Joints,
pot, something.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I keep on seeing this.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's--
that was my brother,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:90%
that's-- he was always smoking.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Smoked pot, yeah.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And my
father said that he's

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.896 align:middle line:84%
been smelling it
around the house.

00:36:40.896 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah!

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:45.327 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:36:45.327 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:90%
It's the funny cigarettes.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Which, here where we're
shooting the show, it's legal,

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:50.090 align:middle line:90%
it's fine.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:90%
It's fine with me.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's him.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.420 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:53.919 align:middle line:90%
That's him.

00:36:53.919 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But I want your dad to get
the messages and move on here.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:03.972 align:middle line:84%
The message is for him to
please-- he needs-- hold on.

00:37:03.972 --> 00:37:06.055 align:middle line:84%
I don't like giving these
messages, but I have to.

00:37:06.055 --> 00:37:08.026 align:middle line:84%
It's the hard part
of doing my job.

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to give it to
you as he gives it to me.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, tell Dad to honor
himself like I didn't.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Dad's committing slow suicide.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.310 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want him to.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:22.480 align:middle line:84%
With-- how he's
tearing himself down.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And to honor his
life, please tell Dad,

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.381 align:middle line:84%
please, please have
him honor his life.

00:37:27.381 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Please Dad-- tell him
not to do the same thing.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:90%
I know there was a gun.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:32.754 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:37:32.754 --> 00:37:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But there was a gun
that Dad was looking

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.504 align:middle line:84%
at, that's got-- thought
about a suicide, himself.

00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:37.878 align:middle line:84%
You're aware of
that, aren't you?

00:37:37.878 --> 00:37:38.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, honey.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:84%
The angels are around
with him, really trying.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And the message today,
please be the medium,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.590 align:middle line:90%
is to save your dad's life.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.420 align:middle line:90%
And to please help Dad.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
His boy doesn't want
him to-- his boy

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.135 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want him
to take his life.

00:37:54.135 --> 00:37:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Let his be that-- Dad has
a lot more opportunities.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a new baby
coming in the family,

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and Dad needs to be
there for the new baby.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you've
brought-- they're

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.975 align:middle line:84%
talking about tattoos--
him, him having tattoos.

00:38:03.975 --> 00:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
You can understand having
one, or had one, or just

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.330 align:middle line:84%
got one, or something
about a tattoo.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My father
has full sleeves.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: If
Dad-- oh, Dad does.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.188 align:middle line:90%
I'm-- look at me.

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.144 align:middle line:84%
I know then, thank you very
much for clarifying that.

00:38:14.144 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:90%
I was not right.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.018 align:middle line:84%
Because he kept on saying,
tattoos, tattoos, tattoos.

00:38:17.018 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I know that he would
either want-- right.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.730 align:middle line:90%
My face on his tattoo.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Your dad has though
about creating

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.204 align:middle line:84%
the face of his son on his
arm or a place in the body.

00:38:27.204 --> 00:38:27.870 align:middle line:90%
That make sense?

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.235 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He has.

00:38:28.235 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He has.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:29.520 align:middle line:90%
He's done that.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He's
thought about it.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's
thought about it.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.735 align:middle line:84%
Would you let him
know, that he knows

00:38:32.735 --> 00:38:34.090 align:middle line:90%
that he's thinking about that.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you let
him know that he's around him

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.680 align:middle line:90%
when he's depressed.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you let him know

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.184 align:middle line:84%
that he's in the
bedroom with him.

00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And he sits there in the
bed, looking at the photos.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.808 align:middle line:84%
Would you let him know that
I'm standing right next to him,

00:38:43.808 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:90%
and I know that he has my phone.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.584 align:middle line:84%
He has my phone, he
has a phone, he's

00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:49.500 align:middle line:84%
looking at something
that belonged to his son.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking at this,
something with his pictures

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:51.719 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:52.636 align:middle line:90%
Not only you, but him.

00:38:52.636 --> 00:38:55.177 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm standing right
next to Dad, I'm kissing him.

00:38:55.177 --> 00:38:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:56.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave with that.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:90%
Blessings.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:03.622 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.622 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to come over
here, because I

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.150 align:middle line:90%
have a lady standing right here.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
you losing your mom.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>AUDIENCE: Me?

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's a
lady standing right here.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.024 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know who she is.

00:39:12.024 --> 00:39:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure if it's you.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:13.859 align:middle line:90%
You lost your mom?

00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Is that Mom?

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I have to-- sorry,
I was with you.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
each other, do you?

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, we are friends.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
you're a friend.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:90%
Did you know her mother at all?

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.228 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:39:21.228 --> 00:39:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Too bad.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.970 align:middle line:90%
She's a character.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:26.710 align:middle line:84%
She's really funny,
she's a character,

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.139 align:middle line:90%
and that's really, really great.

00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:29.180 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you please?

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you already
asked a question, great,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.868 align:middle line:90%
which opened the space.

00:39:31.868 --> 00:39:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to come
to you, if you could.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind,
would you mind just

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.660 align:middle line:90%
standing again, please?

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.587 align:middle line:90%
And also I need your name again.

00:39:42.587 --> 00:39:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lisa Marshall.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lisa Marshall.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Lisa Marshall.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And Lisa Marshall, as I
come to you, Lisa Marshall,

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I love to come into
your space, because I

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.860 align:middle line:84%
do share this space
with your mother,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and I knew she was right
there, and you brought her in.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.740 align:middle line:90%
You brought her in.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And you asked for her in
the hallway, she said.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's actually
my grandmother, I think.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, the
grandmother is here.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.585 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: But she raised me.

00:40:00.585 --> 00:40:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
she raised you.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:90%
This is your mother's mother?

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
mother's also passed over,

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:05.220 align:middle line:90%
but then her mother.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.042 align:middle line:90%
And whose dishes do you have?

00:40:07.042 --> 00:40:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother's.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.498 align:middle line:90%
So she's here with her.

00:40:09.498 --> 00:40:10.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak-- OK,
she'll speak to you too.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me get Grandma
more through for you.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I understand about
the piano, yeah.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.045 align:middle line:90%
The piano.

00:40:17.045 --> 00:40:18.254 align:middle line:90%
You remember about the piano.

00:40:18.254 --> 00:40:20.503 align:middle line:84%
So as we come through the
memory, she's talking about,

00:40:20.503 --> 00:40:23.310 align:middle line:84%
you remember having memories
about a piano in the family.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:24.285 align:middle line:90%
Or a piano at my place.

00:40:24.285 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My mother
played the piano.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mother did.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.709 align:middle line:90%
Your mother played the piano.

00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But you know about
that piano memory.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Mom'd sit there
sometimes and play it.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh good.

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Great, great.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:32.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.875 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I
wanted to do that-- I

00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:36.245 align:middle line:84%
want to do that on
Saturday night, sometimes.

00:40:36.245 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:90%
I do want to do that.

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.703 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see--
I'm sitting there,

00:40:38.703 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and as I'm seeing
this scene play out,

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware that
I'm looking up at her.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So this was either
sitting down on the floor

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.520 align:middle line:84%
looking up at her, from
the carpet, looking up.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
do you remember

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.620 align:middle line:84%
when she-- do you
have a sister as well?

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.235 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My mother was
much more like my sister.

00:40:50.235 --> 00:40:52.068 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
mother was like a sister.

00:40:52.068 --> 00:40:54.277 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing doing hair in
the sink, or in the bathtub.

00:40:54.277 --> 00:40:55.818 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a
ritual type of thing.

00:40:55.818 --> 00:40:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Every week we've got
the bath and the hair.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's the mother.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:40:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's the mother.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.359 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:02.185 align:middle line:84%
Well, you figure it
out, because all I know

00:41:02.185 --> 00:41:03.850 align:middle line:84%
is washing the
hair every week, I

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:84%
feel like a ritual
type of thing.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And if you'd
have that memory for me,

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.550 align:middle line:84%
because she goes to
that memory, please.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.057 align:middle line:84%
And who was the man that
was in the military, please?

00:41:12.057 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My stepfather, Tony.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he raised--
helped raise you at one point?

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:17.635 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And did you not
connect with him sometimes?

00:41:17.635 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You couldn't
connect with him, sometimes.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.207 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, when I
was younger, we had trouble.

00:41:23.207 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know that March,
the month of March,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
is significant for something.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So I know someone's
birthday is in March.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.176 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother,
who committed suicide.

00:41:31.176 --> 00:41:32.279 align:middle line:90%
He was-- you know.

00:41:32.279 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
That's why I didn't know.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that's what
you were thinking of, too.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So isn't it interesting,
we had a suicide here,

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.140 align:middle line:90%
another one right here.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Now this is very
interesting, in that we never

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.951 align:middle line:84%
know what the heck's
going to happen.

00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is really interesting,
because many times one spirit

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.660 align:middle line:84%
will come through with a
condition, like a suicide,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.243 align:middle line:84%
many others will
come in the same way.

00:41:48.243 --> 00:41:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I found, also,
that organizations

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.704 align:middle line:84%
on the other side,
suicide organizations,

00:41:51.704 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:84%
or different ways
of passing, they

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.930 align:middle line:84%
come to groups like this,
demonstrations, to work.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's very interesting.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they almost come through
that whole energetic doorway,

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:01.720 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So you're helping
each other out.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Can I just say that.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Can I go to your
brother, if I might?

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.928 align:middle line:90%
And would anyone know Joseph?

00:42:07.928 --> 00:42:11.022 align:middle line:84%
Between the two of you, who
would know Joseph or a Joe?

00:42:11.022 --> 00:42:13.736 align:middle line:84%
Or would your
brother know a Joe?

00:42:13.736 --> 00:42:16.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I just want to
say, I have a suicide as well.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you
have a suicide as well.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:17.810 align:middle line:90%
My God.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And my bro-- and
his brother is named Joe.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Joe.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have a whole
row of suicides.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at this going on here.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why this show is so
interesting, because you never

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.510 align:middle line:90%
know what's going to happen.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So some of the things
that related to both,

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:29.660 align:middle line:90%
you hear about.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.551 align:middle line:84%
And you have someone else
that left their life.

00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:33.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your husband.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Completed suicide?

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wow.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's-- and you also.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Are you related?

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have one,
two, three, four.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, isn't that interesting.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Can I just say that
your coming here

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:84%
with your brother, who is
helping all of these people

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.154 align:middle line:90%
right here, now.

00:42:48.154 --> 00:42:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
mission, right now.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:50.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:90%
So, so I have-- you also.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So your husband was--
completed suicide.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.744 align:middle line:90%
And who was it for you?

00:42:55.744 --> 00:42:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My father.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your father.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:57.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:58.469 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:00.632 align:middle line:84%
So let me just throw out
everything here, if I can.

00:43:00.632 --> 00:43:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I just want to stay with
you, with your mother,

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:03.660 align:middle line:90%
for just a second here.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk
about happier times.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I want all of you to
think of happy times.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to think of
them as completed suicide.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.970 align:middle line:84%
That's just how
they left the body.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.490 align:middle line:90%
They're OK now.

00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't your fault.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.760 align:middle line:84%
If I go to you
grandmother's house, when

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.200 align:middle line:84%
you were a young
girl, I know she

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.180 align:middle line:90%
took care of a lot of people.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.683 align:middle line:84%
I mean, took care of the
family, but not just you.

00:43:20.683 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:90%
There were others there as well.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why she keeps
on showing me lemonade,

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and making lemonade, but
I want to go to that time.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Around eight years of
age, seven years of age.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.866 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm
either sitting on a porch,

00:43:29.866 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:90%
or I'm outside of the house.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
that in my mind.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was in the back.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It
was the back porch,

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:90%
back deck, something like that.

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.825 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I just want her

00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to-- bring that ray of
sunshine to you, she said.

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And you're very gifted
with your hands,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.950 align:middle line:90%
but you've forgotten your gifts.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:46.640 align:middle line:90%
You're artistic.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.590 align:middle line:84%
You're a very artistic
type of person.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.386 align:middle line:84%
You have creativity
in your hands.

00:43:50.386 --> 00:43:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You understand
what she's saying.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And you've forgotten
this, or you

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:84%
haven't used this
in a long time.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that you've
been given this gift,

00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and I really would
love to use it.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't-- don't--
I want to use it.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So I know that having
this-- Karen here today,

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:84%
with the shaman, it's
very interesting,

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.070 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
fully integrate and feel

00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
worthy of coming back to
yourself and using your gifts.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're a healer as well,
but you don't use it enough.

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And part of it's not
believing in yourself more.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, the people that you're
around, yes, we can do it,

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:90%
but I want to do more of it.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to put you here.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Stop being here.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.510 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:27.557 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:44:27.557 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And music's
very good with you.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You can use music to bring
you to a higher levels.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like, I don't
believe I'm worthy of it,

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
or I shouldn't do it,
or give more time to it

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:90%
than I'm giving.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:37.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Who had the cancer?

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Lady with the cancer.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother
died of cancer.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm just getting
that very, very strong here.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you think of
her, these memories

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:84%
you have, just to clear
away those old memories,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:48.070 align:middle line:90%
because she's not like that.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:49.486 align:middle line:84%
She was in pain,
but she's not one

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:90%
to talk about pain too much.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.470 align:middle line:84%
She was very much into her own--
you know, I have pain, maybe,

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:54.096 align:middle line:90%
but guess what?

00:44:54.096 --> 00:44:54.928 align:middle line:90%
That's not who I am.

00:44:54.928 --> 00:44:56.402 align:middle line:84%
That's not how I
identify myself.

00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:57.610 align:middle line:90%
I know you have candlesticks.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:58.700 align:middle line:90%
I know you have dishware.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.327 align:middle line:84%
I know you have my
paintings, as well.

00:45:00.327 --> 00:45:01.410 align:middle line:90%
She's telling me all that.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:02.410 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.826 align:middle line:84%
I'd just like to
say you honor it.

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that you
either did one room,

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:84%
you made up a room where you
sit, where you have room,

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:84%
where you can do meditation,
or this sort of thing.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:11.278 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:11.278 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I go to that
room, I know that I even

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.307 align:middle line:84%
have something hanging on
the wall with words on it.

00:45:16.307 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.263 align:middle line:84%
So Grandmother sits there,
your mother sits there,

00:45:20.263 --> 00:45:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and I want to say that you
need to look at the words

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and live it.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't just hang the words.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:26.400 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.491 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:32.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to see
if I can connect here

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.160 align:middle line:84%
with you, with the
gentleman that passed over.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
is your name, please?

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Meredith.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Meredith,
would you mind standing?

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:43.985 align:middle line:84%
And Meredith, I
just want to talk

00:45:43.985 --> 00:45:47.340 align:middle line:90%
about the man that passed away.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.474 align:middle line:84%
That was your husband,
or was that your father?

00:45:49.474 --> 00:45:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My father.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask
about-- do you recently

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.494 align:middle line:84%
have old pictures
you were looking at?

00:45:57.494 --> 00:45:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you place
them out either on a table--

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at all
these old pictures.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that he was with you,

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.120 align:middle line:90%
looking at these pictures.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.554 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's a
mother there as well.

00:46:08.554 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I have
Mother's picture there,

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.300 align:middle line:84%
my father's picture there, or
the family's picture there.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if you
are having a family

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.744 align:middle line:84%
reunion with all
these photographs.

00:46:15.744 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.094 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
know that someone

00:46:18.094 --> 00:46:19.260 align:middle line:90%
had trouble with their feet.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Feet.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Me.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You have
trouble with feet.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:21.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And have you thought about
going to a podiatrist,

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.700 align:middle line:90%
or just come from a podiatrist?

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Or going to a specialist
for your feet?

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I've
thought about it.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And are
you getting orthotics?

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have them.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hm.

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:32.726 align:middle line:90%
You need to change them.

00:46:32.726 --> 00:46:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You need
to change your orthotics.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So your mother's on the
other side with your father.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why I get a
lady here, very interesting.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Your father is-- I gotta
say, up here I'm not--

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I go up and down.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So I get bouts of
depression, then I'm happy.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.140 align:middle line:90%
I go up and down.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
that as raised as a child,

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel my worth
there in that family.

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:54.454 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:46:54.454 --> 00:46:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:55.828 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:55.828 --> 00:46:57.577 align:middle line:90%
So it's nothing to do with you.

00:46:57.577 --> 00:46:59.160 align:middle line:84%
It's to do with who's
been brought up,

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.827 align:middle line:84%
and that soul choosing that
family, that existence, there.

00:47:01.827 --> 00:47:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- he didn't get the
encouragement he needed for his

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.930 align:middle line:90%
own soul to go.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Where you live right now,
there are two sitting rooms.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.014 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:47:11.014 --> 00:47:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that your
family visits you in one

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:16.340 align:middle line:84%
sitting room more
than the other one.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.798 align:middle line:84%
And the one that
they visit you in,

00:47:17.798 --> 00:47:19.264 align:middle line:84%
there's photos all
over the place.

00:47:19.264 --> 00:47:20.180 align:middle line:90%
That's where they are.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:23.783 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I want to
talk about your dad fishing.

00:47:23.783 --> 00:47:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to say,
he loves fishing.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He loved it.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He loved it.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you have a
photo of him with a fish,

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:29.675 align:middle line:90%
holding a fish.

00:47:29.675 --> 00:47:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
have that photo.

00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there was
one of those photos that

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.410 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on that table
that you were looking at.

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:35.280 align:middle line:90%
He was fishing.

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.310 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Just evidential, so he knows
that you know that he's there.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I know that you need to
take care of-- go on.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:43.580 align:middle line:90%
He's talking with Mom.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.300 align:middle line:90%
He's talking a lot.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And his watch.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:90%
He's sorry any pain he's caused.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:49.340 align:middle line:90%
He's sorry.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.524 align:middle line:90%
And that Peggy's over there too.

00:47:51.524 --> 00:47:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Someone named Peggy or Margaret
on the other side as well.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Wants to say hello to you.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.380 align:middle line:90%
And what else.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:47:59.800 align:middle line:90%
What else was-- her eyes.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:00.944 align:middle line:90%
So your eyes.

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You either had to
have them looked

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.090 align:middle line:84%
at recently, but
something with the eyes.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So they're just
telling me that here.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things relayed to,

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.236 align:middle line:84%
they're looking after
you from the other side.

00:48:10.236 --> 00:48:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Your father's being
the father he can now

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.534 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't be on the earth.

00:48:13.534 --> 00:48:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So he wants to thank
you for everything.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.970 align:middle line:84%
He's sorry to cause
pain, but he's also

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.469 align:middle line:84%
thanking you for
being his daughter.

00:48:18.469 --> 00:48:19.815 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:48:19.815 --> 00:48:20.653 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:48:20.653 --> 00:48:21.569 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:21.569 --> 00:48:23.469 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It seems
that we mostly worked here

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and you guys, I
don't know, were just

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.154 align:middle line:84%
setting the space
and the energy.

00:48:28.154 --> 00:48:30.030 align:middle line:90%
But I thank you all very much.

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
for being here today,

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.680 align:middle line:90%
and everybody watching.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.926 align:middle line:84%
And [SIGH] religion is
really that belief system.

00:48:36.926 --> 00:48:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And the religion that
I think all of us

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:90%
would love to have is love.

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So use that religion wisely, and
change the energy of everyone

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you meet with that
religion, love.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Until next time, go in peace.

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Bye-bye.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.540 align:middle line:90%
