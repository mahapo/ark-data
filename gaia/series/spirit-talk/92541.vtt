00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.247 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.247 --> 00:00:33.691 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.215 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:37.825 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for joining me.

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Thank you at home,
also, for joining me

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
on "Spirit Talk," where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So today we're going to go
through a subject matter which

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
is held deeply in my heart,
because I am someone who works

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:84%
from this point of view,
in that today we're

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:90%
going to discuss healing.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
How many of you in
this room need healing?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:90%
Anybody not raising their hand?

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So healing, many people
don't know really

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
what we mean by healing,
so for today's show

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.045 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to share with
you my interpretation of healing

00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
for just this hour, what
we're going to go through.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:90%
Healing to me is balance.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Energy meaning that everything,
molecules or electrodes--

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and really vibrating and moving
at a certain rate of speed,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and we are pure energy.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:90%
We are just pure energy.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
This body that we have
here is just an illusion.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:90%
It really is, sorry.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
You the driver, being the
soul, are inside a car.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:90%
This is the outside of the car.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
You are the soul inside that car
that really gets from one place

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.350 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very important
that we realize, number one,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:90%
that we are energy.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
We are pure energy, and,
really, energy cannot die.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Energy changes form.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think as souls we
come back on this level

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to learn various lessons
and go through various tests

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that our soul needs to learn to
expand, to understand itself,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:90%
to understand one another.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's important also to
realize that the earth world is

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
not the only school
to come back to.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So your soul can go
to many other schools,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
because there are many
other galaxies, many star

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:90%
systems, many planets.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.212 align:middle line:84%
This is just one
of many schools.

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Probably one of
the hardest schools

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
to come back to, because we're
thrown here with other souls

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
from all different
levels of awareness.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
We're thrown here
with souls come

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
from-- learniong basic
things, like nursery school.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Or to other souls who are very
evolved in postgraduate work.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Some souls think that
violence and hatred

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
is the way it
should be, and there

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
are others that know that
only love and compassion is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.384 align:middle line:90%
the way it should be.

00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's just
something to look at,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
that you are really just a soul
having this human experience.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.824 align:middle line:84%
Now, today's show being on
healing, to me, is balance.

00:02:43.824 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:90%
It's about bringing balance.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's about bringing harmony.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It's about bringing
an awareness.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about bringing
enlightenment.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's really bringing
an awareness, if you will.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I often say the
first step in healing

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
is having an awareness of
something; it's being aware.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.975 align:middle line:84%
That's a first step,
and to opening yourself

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:90%
up to being aware of something.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And I like to stay
away from judgment,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because I find
judgment is fear-based,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and fear is the
opposite of what we are.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:90%
We, as soul beings, are love.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We are made from
the energy of love,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and the further you get away
from that energy of love,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.807 align:middle line:84%
the further you get away from
your natural state of being,

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:20.473 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
be har-- you're not

00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:90%
going to be happy in life.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find there's
no balance in your life.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.725 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find that
you're affected so easily

00:03:25.725 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
by what other people think.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start living
other people's lives instead

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
of your own lives,
and you're going

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to be less of who you truly are.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
When we take on
other people's energy

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.234 align:middle line:84%
and start living
their lives, we're

00:03:37.234 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:90%
not being true to ourselves.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:90%
We're not living our own lives.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So I often ask people in my
audiences how many of you

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
are living other
people's lives right now?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:90%
One.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
God bless you for
raising your hand.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.259 align:middle line:90%
You can raise your hand.

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:90%
We're all learning.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I think we all are.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:90%
So there.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
I think in some ways
we all are or we have,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because I think for the
majority, a lot of people

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:84%
have gone through their
lives really with a sense of,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
if I just do this
one thing, I'll

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.824 align:middle line:84%
receive more love from
my mother and my father.

00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:84%
If we just do this
or act a certain way,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
they're going to love me more.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
If I just do this
in the relationship,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:90%
they're going to love me more.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And if I just do
this for my child,

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:90%
they're going to love me more.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
I know that I entered
the priesthood

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.745 align:middle line:90%
when I was 14 years of age.

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:90%
To be a priest.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine me as a priest?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But I did that for
a very-- at the time

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I did it, because I knew there
was a calling that I had.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I had to do
something for the humankind,

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
what it was about.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.465 align:middle line:84%
Did I think I was
going to be a priest?

00:04:34.465 --> 00:04:36.775 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think so, but
something was going on there.

00:04:36.775 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
left that after I

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
heard a voice say to me,
after a year being there,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I heard a voice
say, James, you must

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
find God outside
these four walls.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
God is much bigger
than these four walls.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to go find God outside.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I went to a New
York City public high school

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:90%
and had a great time, loved it.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But I found out
that, after a while

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
of having a little bit
of space to look back,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I
went to that school

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to be a priest because I
wanted the love from my mother.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I wanted her to love me
more, and I thought, wow,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
if I did that, that
she'll give me more love.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So I did that just
to please her.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So many of us live our lives
just to please other people.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.722 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:05:16.722 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
How many people do
you go out of your way

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
to please just so you can
try to get back their love?

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.384 align:middle line:84%
People have to love you
just for who you are,

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:90%
not who they want you to be.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Just for who you are.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can reach more people,
you can teach more people,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and you can open
up to more people

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and make them be more aware by
being strong within yourself

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and holding on to who you are.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.015 align:middle line:90%
You're not here by accident.

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
None of you are
here by accident.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:84%
We're all here for
a great cosmic plan

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
which our souls have worked
out before we came back

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.935 align:middle line:90%
into this incarnation.

00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:46.555 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very true.

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:48.391 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny, people
say, I got to fit in.

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:49.516 align:middle line:90%
I got to do this to fit in.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I got to be this way to fit in.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Make more people
love me or like me.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Not true.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.765 align:middle line:84%
Every single person
here is a unique soul.

00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And I often say that
we're like snowflakes.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We have a unique pattern;
we have a unique description

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And no two people are like.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:84%
We're all unique beings,
and we are all stars.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:90%
Every single one of us.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And in order to make
that beautiful galaxy,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
we have to be our unique star.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And the further you go
away from that, the further

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:90%
you're in peril.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Peril.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Such a Biblical sound.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Peril.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:90%
But it's really, really true.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So as we go through
the school of life,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we tend to take on
other people's energy.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.143 align:middle line:84%
We tend to take on what
they want us to live

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:90%
instead of who we are.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We tend to feel, why
did they do that to me?

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.272 align:middle line:90%
And become a victim.

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I have victim
consciousness.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:90%
How could they do that to me?

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe they
didn't know any better.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.216 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they didn't
know any better,

00:06:39.216 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
so maybe now is your opportunity
to step back and, instead

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of being in judgment
and fear-based,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
step back, take
a breath, and see

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:90%
the totality of the experience.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
See it from a
bigger perspective.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Why did this person
manifest this behavior?

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And am I subjecting
myself to this behavior?

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:90%
What is it teaching my soul?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:90%
What's the reason why it's here?

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So many people hold
on to stuff not only

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
from people that, well,
supposedly do them

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
wrong in lifetime, family
members and friends

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And we really set a hold in
energy which is like, oh,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't have done that.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:90%
How could you do that?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forgive you.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forgive you.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's unfortunate because,
from a spiritual point of view,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
when I look at someone's
aura, their auric field,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic field
around every living thing,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.700 align:middle line:84%
I can see right away if
that energy is flowing

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:90%
or if it's not.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
If there are obstructions
in that flow.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And many, many times
the obstruction

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:90%
will be an emotional charge.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
An emotional charge which
they're holding onto

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
based upon what somebody
else might have done to them

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
or how could they have
done that to them,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.752 align:middle line:84%
should they have
done that to them.

00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, you're
not being in balance.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
You're throwing off that
balance of the energy flow.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Everything flows.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Energy flows, and if you're
going to hold onto something,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.561 align:middle line:84%
emotion let's say,
an emotional charge

00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
based on what someone
else did to you or someone

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't do to you or even perhaps
some kind of a loss, a divorce,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
or even someone who
passed over, sometimes

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:90%
we hold onto these things.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And they upset us because
the energy can't flow.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:90%
It dams us up.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It dams us up, and that'll
affect every single choice

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:90%
we have in our lives.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:90%
We'll be colored.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll be looking at the world
from different perspectives

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
of being half than we are.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to work
today with the healing,

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and the healing to me is
bringing through that balance,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that awareness, that we are
perfect in our beingness.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.806 align:middle line:84%
And we are perfect,
warts and all.

00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the experiences
we have on this earth

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
are really opportunities
for our growth.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:90%
They really are.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And healing energy
is all around us.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The healing energy is
really in the chairs

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.269 align:middle line:84%
we're sitting in and in
the walls and the cloths.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:90%
It all has energy.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And the trees and the
dirt outside, the grass.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all energy, and
part of, for you,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
is to realize that that energy
is always available for you

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
to use.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything is God.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:90%
God is a pure, loving energy.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I like to say that God is not
the bearded God that we grew up

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
with, many of us, in
a religious context.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
But also, I feel it's an energy.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:84%
I call God the Omnipresent
Nurturing Energy.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:90%
O-N-E. ONE.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Omnipresent Nurturing Energy.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:90%
And we're all one.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.962 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected as one.

00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Two biggest illusions we have
in this world is, number one,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:90%
that there's death.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:90%
There is no such thing as death.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't kill energy;
it just changes form.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And the second is that we're
separate from one another.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not separate; we're
connected to one another.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:90%
We're never separate.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you pass
out of this dimension

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
into the spiritual dimensions,
you'll see, oh my gosh,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:90%
we are all connected.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.059 align:middle line:84%
We're connected
with our thoughts.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:37.350 align:middle line:90%
When we think of somebody else.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
The actions that we
do to somebody else.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.711 align:middle line:90%
How do we think about ourselves?

00:09:41.711 --> 00:09:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
How do we think about ourselves?

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to work today with
bringing back that remembrance

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
that you have deep
within your soul

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that you are a beautiful
being of light.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And bring back that
balance, that harmony,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.565 align:middle line:84%
and that oneness that you are,
which sometimes, we get so

00:09:55.565 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
caught up in the head
about things that

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.780 align:middle line:84%
have happened or didn't
happen or people that left us

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and where are we that
we forget the heart.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is the seat
of the healing space.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It's in here, the heart,
that we can truly heal,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.786 align:middle line:84%
for this is where the
energy is, the soul energy.

00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
work with that today.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:90%
I like to use the green light.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The green light, for me, is
the light, the frequency,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:84%
of the heart energy that
brings about the balance, that

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:84%
brings about harmony
and peace and oneness.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:90%
It's that green light.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.181 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
use that today.

00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:26.805 align:middle line:84%
So before I bring
you into a meditation

00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:29.477 align:middle line:84%
and to this healing
vibration-- which

00:10:29.477 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I think you're all here because
you're meant to be here.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.268 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's watching
at this moment

00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
because they're meant to
be watching at this moment.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
believe in accidents.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
I believe in divine timing.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Things are meant
to be, and I think

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:90%
that's really what it's about.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.486 align:middle line:90%
What it's about.

00:10:44.486 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So before we begin,
would anybody

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
have any questions
about healing or today

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
or any general questions
you'd like to ask?

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Anything at all?

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.902 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: How does the
green light promote healing?

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.745 align:middle line:84%
The green light
promotes healing.

00:10:56.745 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, we use the color
green, for me personally,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
because the frequency of
the green-- every color

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
has a certain
frequency, if you will.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Or a voice to it or an
energy that's at a certain,

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
let's say, musical note
or resonance, if you will.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And for me, green is part
of the heart energy, which

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is where the healing
energy is stored.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I use
the green light.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, if you
want, thoughts are things.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are things.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you open yourself up to
the intention of your thoughts

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and be there-- the first psychic
I ever went to see said to me,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
if you can hold a thought for
three seconds, it's yours.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Because thoughts are things.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are real.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And so if we hold the
thought with that intention,

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that gives it the
energy, if you will,

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
to move ahead and come into
that awareness of healing

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and bring ourselves to a state
of mind to receive the healing

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and realize we're so much
more than we think we are.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that good?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.179 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Over here.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.944 align:middle line:90%
This lady right back here.

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.436 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So who
you-- what do you

00:11:53.436 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
want with healing
today as far as-- what

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
do you think about that
when I say "healing" to you?

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's a
good question, James.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.755 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:02.075 align:middle line:90%
I'm full of them.

00:12:02.075 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just felt
like I had to ask you.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
healing with or when

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
you think of healing,
what do you thing?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A lot
of times I feel--

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
feel that healing-- the opposite
of healing is resistance.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.566 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And I see people who
are resistant a lot of times,

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.919 align:middle line:84%
and I also see that I can
be projecting that also.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So maybe
just the healing

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of my own resistance
of who I am.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Fabulous.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's really-- that's
a great, great point.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name's Lori.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you, Lori.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.533 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:90%
It's really a good one.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a real good one
because so many people think

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.359 align:middle line:84%
about other people, and I
want to heal that person.

00:12:47.359 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that person.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I want this
situation in my life.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:90%
Or that.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And instead of--

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's really hard sometimes
to go and heal that person,

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
per se, or bring them
into balance or awareness.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But if we start
within ourselves,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and we worry first
about-- not worry,

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
but take awareness of
the microcosm that we are

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and bring that into oneness
and that into healing,

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
that will definitely affect
those in the macrocosm.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.321 align:middle line:84%
And it's also true with the
world's conditions right now.

00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:84%
People are often
emailing me saying,

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.880 align:middle line:90%
how can I help the world?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm upset with what's going
on in the world right now.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't go over,
necessarily, and fight,

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:84%
but you certainly can
work within yourself

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and have a healing here
and bringing a balance

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:90%
to your own life.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.649 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, there's what's
called the rippling effect.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And the rippling
effect really works.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Where you're just going
on here, and this happens,

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.808 align:middle line:84%
this awareness happens,
and eventually it

00:13:33.808 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
will lead to someone else.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
It'll be connect to somebody
else and somebody else.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And it really does work.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that it works because
I'm standing proof of that.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago, I went out
and talked to dead people

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:90%
and they thought I was crazy.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Because you wait.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:84%
You wait, because it'll
get to someone eventually.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
The rippling effect will
happen, and it has happened.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And now we wouldn't have
this television show.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:90%
There wouldn't be a Gaiam TV.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.350 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be
spiritual books and movies

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.600 align:middle line:90%
without this work out there.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It's now mainstream.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So, I do believe that if we
start working within ourselves,

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.022 align:middle line:84%
we can really affect
those in the greater need.

00:14:02.022 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So I want to do a
little meditation now

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.940 align:middle line:84%
for you, or a mind journey,
if we can call it that.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a wonderful
opportunity for you all

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to have this awareness and
take this home with you.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Take that home with you.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.436 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
start with a breath.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So all those people that are
watching us at home, just

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.664 align:middle line:90%
close your eyes.

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And those who are in the studio,
if you just want to close eyes.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And let's just take
a refreshing breath.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And I find when taking the
breath, if you breathe in

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:84%
through your nose and then
hold that and then let it out

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:84%
through your mouth, it's
really, really good.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that
with the breathing,

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to give
that breathing a little bit

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:84%
of a label on it, which
is when you breathe in,

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
imagine that you're
breathing in new energy.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.079 align:middle line:90%
You're bringing in new life.

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.495 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing
in the God source,

00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
or your connection
to God source.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing in that sense
of oneness, your connection

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.714 align:middle line:90%
to oneness.

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to envision
that as a beautiful, beautiful

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And this could be a
golden light coming

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.567 align:middle line:90%
through the top of the head.

00:15:05.567 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And just bringing yourself
to that beautiful space

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.781 align:middle line:84%
of the heart in your
neutrality of being.

00:15:10.781 --> 00:15:12.155 align:middle line:84%
So together we're
going to inhale

00:15:12.155 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful, golden light
through the top of the head.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.099 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:15:15.099 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And hold it.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Two, three, four, and exhale.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Let it go out of the mouth where
that energy really falls off

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to Mother Earth, and Mother
Earth recycles that to love.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So again, imagine a beautiful
beam of light, a divine light,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
coming within, illuminating
the inside of your being.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, let go of
all the old ways of thinking,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
old conditions, negative
thinking, other people's

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
energy in your space.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:90%
So together let's inhale.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:59.311 align:middle line:84%
And hold it two, three,
four, and exhale.

00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And just connecting
to your divine light.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:90%
And holding it.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Two, three, four, and exhale.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And just let it be.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.537 align:middle line:90%
Just let it be.

00:16:19.537 --> 00:16:20.880 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And just keeping the rhythm of
the breath remaining the same.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to pay
attention to your heartbeat.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:90%
The beating of the heart.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Like the ebb and
flow of the oceans.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:90%
In and out.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.949 align:middle line:90%
In and out.

00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:39.865 align:middle line:84%
We'll bring more light
to that beautiful heart

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
area, that green
light of the heart,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.550 align:middle line:90%
and feel your divine love.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Your soul's light is
tucked beautifully

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:90%
behind your heart center.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:58.068 align:middle line:84%
Just feel that beautiful light
of your soul, of your heart.

00:16:58.068 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes just giving
ourselves permission to feel,

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:84%
it's giving ourselves permission
to sit in this space, to be.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.700 align:middle line:90%
We worry so much about the past.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.700 align:middle line:90%
The past has already happened.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes worry
about the future.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
The future is yet to be,
so don't waste the energy.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.829 align:middle line:90%
Just live in this moment now.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.636 align:middle line:84%
This true moment where
there is no fear.

00:17:26.636 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:90%
You're living in the present.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
So again, inhale.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.275 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:17:35.275 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit in this space
of your beautiful divine light,

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
just feel now, standing
right behind you,

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:84%
there may be a guide, a
teacher, a healing guide.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And just sending out
a thought to them.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Dear healing guide of
light, we ask you now

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to step into our
space behind us.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Dear healing guide of light,
you have our permission just

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to step in this space
behind us, illuminate us

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:84%
as you touch our shoulders
and we feel your energy.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
We feel this beautiful
balance, this oneness,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:90%
this connectedness to light.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:90%
And just feel that.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge that.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Spirit are always around us,
but are we there to listen?

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Can we open up our minds
just a little bit to receive?

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So as you feel this beautiful
energy of your healing guide,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
just be mindful of
what that feels like.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, just
perhaps, they'll

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
give you a sign, a signal, a
feeling, an emotion, something

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
where you can recognize
your healing guide.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:90%
And let that be.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And connect with
them, and thank them.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, how beautiful.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath,
and feel their energy.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.148 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:19:04.148 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And now, in your mind's
eye, in your imagination,

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
your guide will take you
to a beautiful garden.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And just see, feel,
experience as best as you can,

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
whether you can
see it or feel it

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:84%
or just imagine
something like it.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:90%
A lovely garden.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Green, green meadows of
grass, and all different types

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:90%
of flowers.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Roses and daffodils and lilacs.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And trees of all
different types.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Sycamores and oak trees,
ficus trees, redwood trees.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
Whatever's right for you.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.639 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is in harmony with your
beingness, with your spirit.

00:19:46.639 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.556 align:middle line:90%
And breathe that in.

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you stand there
with your healing guide,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:84%
look all around you at
the spiritual landscape.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of every
flower, every leaf

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
on every tree, the grass
underneath your feet.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Be mindful how light it feels.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps in the distance
you hear children playing

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and the animals barking
at their new reunited

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:90%
loved ones crossing over.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the
oneness of all energy.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that,
your guide says to you,

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.400 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go to
a very special place.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go now to
the Healing Temple of Light.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So dear friends, your
angel, your healing angel,

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:90%
takes you by the hand.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you're standing

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
in front of this
lovely, lovely building.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
This marble building mixed
with the mother of pearl.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.570 align:middle line:84%
It's an open space
with just, perhaps,

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
an awareness that there are
walls, but there really aren't.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.014 align:middle line:90%
You can see right through them.

00:20:59.014 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And dear friends,
they have set up

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful space inside
this Healing Temple of Light

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:90%
just for you.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
The crowd has been
waiting for you.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Your loved ones in
spirit have been there,

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and your loved ones
living upon the earth.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
They've also been
waiting for this moment,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.130 align:middle line:84%
for their higher self is in
this spirit at all times.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So your guide leads you
to this lovely chair

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
this room, and there

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:90%
are bleachers all around you.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful seats of
beings of light.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit in this
red velvet gold chair,

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
just sitting there, you
become aware as you look down

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
at your clothing you no longer
are wearing earth clothes.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You have your
spiritual robes on.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Look and see and feel what
colors those robes are.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful of the
texture of the robes.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And why exactly are you wearing
those particular colors?

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Those particular robes?

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And just know the oneness
that has made this possible.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.235 align:middle line:84%
And as your guide
backs up behind you,

00:22:09.235 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
you look around the
crowd in this room.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.190 align:middle line:84%
They've all come for your
love and to love you.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you look around the
room, you see their faces,

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and there are some you may not
have seen for many, many years

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:90%
from this lifetime.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of those you
might have forgotten.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Many are still in the
physical vibration,

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.334 align:middle line:84%
but you haven't thought
of them for a long time,

00:22:34.334 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and there are some there
that have passed over

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
to the world of the
spirit full time,

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of standing there as
well or sitting there as well.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
As you sit in that chair, one by
one, someone comes before you,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and don't try to control who
it is, just let them present

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.120 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.375 align:middle line:84%
Whether they still have a
living body, that's fine.

00:22:58.375 --> 00:23:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The physical earth or in the
spirit, it doesn't matter.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Let them present themselves
one at a time before you,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.416 align:middle line:84%
for they have come now
to receive your healing.

00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
To receive a thought, a word,
about your love for them.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps an apology.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps an understanding
you now have.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps now is the
opportunity you can send them

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:90%
that love that you've held back.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.916 align:middle line:84%
That forgiveness
you've held back.

00:23:32.916 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Just one at a time let them
receive, and be mindful

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.780 align:middle line:84%
as you give out that apology,
as you give out that love.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of how
their colors change,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
the person in front
of you changes

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
by just hearing your
thought of how you truly

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.365 align:middle line:90%
feel from your heart.

00:23:54.365 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:90%
And the next person.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful as you
send out this healing

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
to those beings who you might
have thought did you wrong, who

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.116 align:middle line:84%
you might have thought
were not there for you,

00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:12.911 align:middle line:84%
who you might have thought could
have done something better,

00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:84%
who you might have thought
held something back.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Become aware what
it's like now to look

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.542 align:middle line:84%
at it from the spiritual point
of view, to take the high road,

00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:26.770 align:middle line:90%
to take the oneness.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.480 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they didn't know better.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Maybe life was tough for them.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So one at a time, let
them pass before you

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and receive your
healing for them.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Receive the balance,
receive the love,

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:90%
the harmony, the connectedness.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful how your
mind, your thoughts,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:55.160 align:middle line:84%
have gotten in the way
of that healing energy.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Things that you projected,
things that you thought were

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:90%
real really weren't.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Just the illusions, just the
limitations of your mind.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.284 align:middle line:90%
They understand that.

00:25:07.284 --> 00:25:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And notice as you heal
each one, as they walk away

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and form a big
circle behind you,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:84%
notice how much
lighter they are.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
How much brighter they
are in their mind,

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.750 align:middle line:90%
their spirit, their energy.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, and
of course, now we

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
have those who passed over
to the world of the spirit.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Mothers and fathers,
one at a time

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
wanting to share
healing energy with you.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
A healing word, a healing
thought, an appreciation.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Now is your chance to send
it back, to honor them,

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.590 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge them.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:90%
They say, we're not dead.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.810 align:middle line:90%
No one's dead.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:90%
There is no death.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:84%
You live in that physical,
three dimensional world thinking

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.590 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't you understand?

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.825 align:middle line:90%
That's the illusionary world.

00:26:05.825 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:90%
We're in the higher life.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:90%
We're home.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:90%
You're just visiting.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Be kind to yourself.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
Love yourself.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And soon we find those loved
ones, our friends, who we've

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
just sent beautiful healing
to are encircling us all.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
They put out their hands,
extend their hands,

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and they send love
from their heart to us.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And they want you
to feel their love,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
feel their healing for you,
feel their forgiveness,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:90%
feel their sorrow.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you feel the energy of
their healing rays of light,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful green
light, within that light

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
is illuminacity and is
awareness of yourself.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to see
yourself as you truly are.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Not what you think you are,
but what you truly are.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the
connectedness of oneness

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
with all of your
loved ones that you

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.310 align:middle line:90%
have healed and have healed you.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep
breath, coming back

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:90%
into the awareness of the body.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.701 align:middle line:84%
Come back into the
awareness of the feet.

00:27:21.701 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.165 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of your
feet and your legs.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.732 align:middle line:90%
Back into the body.

00:27:29.732 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And another time.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Coming back into the body.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.285 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:27:35.285 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Feel the chairs and your back,
your shoulders, your arms,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:84%
your chest, your
neck, your head.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.630 align:middle line:90%
One more time, fully back in.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And open up your
eyes and be as one.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Now put your arms up
and wiggle your fingers.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Get back with the body.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:90%
You all at home?

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.041 align:middle line:90%
I hope you're back.

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.172 align:middle line:90%
Hear my voice.

00:27:57.172 --> 00:27:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Back, back, back.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Was that nice?

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Was that nice?

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.671 align:middle line:90%
Feels nice, doesn't it.

00:28:03.671 --> 00:28:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Anybody have some experiences
you couldn't understand?

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Something happened that
you-- you had a lot.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:90%
You were going.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:90%
You were there.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.147 align:middle line:90%
You were there.

00:28:12.147 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Lots of people around you.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.450 align:middle line:90%
You felt it.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
You want to share
with us what you-- no.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:17.321 align:middle line:90%
It was deep.

00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Anybody want to
share what they got?

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.399 align:middle line:84%
I know it was a very personal
experience for a lot of you.

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it goes to
levels which you never

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:90%
expect, deep in your core.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And many times this
gives us space for us

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.170 align:middle line:90%
to have that healing energy.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.290 align:middle line:90%
It gives us space.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Instead of giving so much energy
to negativity and limitedness

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and judgment, we get a space for
understanding and compassion.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And that sometimes we need.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I find that sometimes
people-- I'm

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:84%
going to cry so I know
I'm feeling it, too.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I know that sometimes it's so
much easier for us to judge.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It's so much easier
as a human being.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, getting out of
the human box, it's tough.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.480 align:middle line:84%
This human world's
tough, because we think--

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.813 align:middle line:84%
we're in the world of illusion,
and we think this is it.

00:28:57.813 --> 00:28:59.210 align:middle line:90%
The limitations, this is it.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.867 align:middle line:90%
We're so much more than that.

00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And so when we have that--
the lid of that box opens up,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and we see that we're so
much more than that, oh

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.560 align:middle line:84%
my gosh, that behavior I had,
how could I have done that?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Why could I have done that?

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.474 align:middle line:90%
How could I behave like that?

00:29:11.474 --> 00:29:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Why did I blame that person?

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it was.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.825 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to do that
because we're here

00:29:15.825 --> 00:29:17.658 align:middle line:84%
in this limited
three-dimensional world, and

00:29:17.658 --> 00:29:18.990 align:middle line:90%
we try to be in control.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:90%
I got to control this is.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
The honest truth is
we have no control.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We have no control,
but we can control

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.940 align:middle line:84%
what we do with
the reaction as far

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:90%
as how we react to other people.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.916 align:middle line:84%
How do we react when someone
treats us a certain way.

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I've often said in this
show and everywhere I

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.490 align:middle line:84%
teach that my belief
is how people treat

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.880 align:middle line:84%
you is their karma; how
you respond and react

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.739 align:middle line:90%
is your karma.

00:29:46.739 --> 00:29:47.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's all energy.

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It's what you do
with the energy.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.190 align:middle line:90%
So is that good?

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.710 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody here in
the room who lost a son?

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.631 align:middle line:84%
A boy that passed over or a
friend of a son that passed?

00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:02.130 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.300 align:middle line:90%
No one knows about that.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know the name
would be Thomas or Tommy.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:90%
There would be a Tom connection.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.840 align:middle line:90%
You don't know that?

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody?

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:90%
I just got to say that to you.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
talk about somebody

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:84%
who either works at a school,
volunteers at a school,

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.680 align:middle line:90%
has been to a school this week.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Been some kind of a schooling.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Does it make sense to somebody?

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Would you have been
to a school this week

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.887 align:middle line:84%
or work at a school or
volunteer at a school?

00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not this week.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.118 align:middle line:84%
Do you volunteer at a
school or go to a school?

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I worked
at the Alaya Preschool.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
mind standing, please?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:34.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mitra.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.273 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mitra.

00:30:37.273 --> 00:30:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Mitra.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How
are you, my love?

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.026 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm goodly

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, good, lovely.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Mitra, so would you
volunteer at a school?

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.879 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I worked at
a Buddhist preschool.

00:30:45.879 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You worked
at a Buddhist preschool?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Priest school?

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Would you know if
there's somebody--

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.349 align:middle line:84%
so you never meet parents
of people, do you?

00:30:53.349 --> 00:30:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Occasionally.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:90%
But not so much.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:55.815 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would
you know someone

00:30:55.815 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Thomas
who passed over?

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.778 align:middle line:84%
Thomas or Tommy who'd have
some connection to a school?

00:31:00.778 --> 00:31:01.653 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Possibly.

00:31:01.653 --> 00:31:02.332 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:02.332 --> 00:31:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.789 align:middle line:84%
So I need to bring
this-- and I'm not sure

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:05.937 align:middle line:90%
if it's the early 20s.

00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:06.645 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: True.

00:31:06.645 --> 00:31:06.910 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I thought 24.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.220 align:middle line:90%
20s.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Understand that?

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.567 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you would--
he comes in close to me

00:31:12.567 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and he said you would
know his mother.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
It would be a connection
with his mother.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Lovely.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.120 align:middle line:84%
So would you mind being
the medium for him?

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, I would not.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if he was--
yes, thank you very much.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.047 align:middle line:90%
He's a very, very bright boy.

00:31:26.047 --> 00:31:28.630 align:middle line:84%
A very smart and bright boy, and
he comes in here and he said,

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.665 align:middle line:84%
please help my
mother and dad out.

00:31:30.665 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:90%
You, please, have to.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Especially my mother, because
she needs to know I'm OK.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I know the name would
be Tom or Thomas would

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.310 align:middle line:84%
be the formal name,
and I need to go there.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I know I have several roads
before me, this young man,

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure
which road to pick.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I know that the mother
feels guilty for some reason

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.124 align:middle line:84%
of his passing, and I don't know
if she was away from him when

00:31:50.124 --> 00:31:52.290 align:middle line:84%
he passed away, but I think
that might have been it.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Might have been away from
him when he passed over.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.280 align:middle line:90%
So I got to go with that.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on, go on.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.224 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:31:58.224 --> 00:31:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Would you know-- and
your name again is?

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mitra.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mitra.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So Mitra, would you know
about the phone ringing?

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Your phone ringing sometimes?

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.739 align:middle line:84%
Your cell phone,
and there's no one

00:32:06.739 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
on the other end or
there's no answer to it

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.450 align:middle line:84%
or something about
electronically something

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.660 align:middle line:84%
has happened with a
cellphone around you?

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.811 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So this man,
Thomas, wants me to tell you

00:32:14.811 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:90%
it's been him.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.112 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to get
your attention.

00:32:17.112 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that there would
be a room in your house,

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:84%
where you live or
where you stay,

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:84%
where there are definitely
a lot of books in that room.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's correct.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's like an
office or a computer's there.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:90%
This is the place there.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.824 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there would be some
time for meditation for you.

00:32:29.824 --> 00:32:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know this boy has

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.899 align:middle line:84%
come to your
meditation, and I know

00:32:32.899 --> 00:32:34.773 align:middle line:84%
this boy would've been
around you when you've

00:32:34.773 --> 00:32:36.200 align:middle line:84%
been around those
books recently.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.905 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:36.905 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:38.904 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
I know if I go

00:32:38.904 --> 00:32:40.600 align:middle line:84%
to the second
shelf of the books,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.650 align:middle line:84%
there could be some books to
do with numbers or mathematics

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.610 align:middle line:84%
or something about putting
pieces of something

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:47.702 align:middle line:84%
together mathematically
or with formulaic way.

00:32:47.702 --> 00:32:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.948 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very clear.

00:32:50.948 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because as
part of you, of your being,

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.881 align:middle line:90%
which is engineeric in a way--

00:32:54.881 --> 00:32:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, so true.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.796 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So true.

00:32:56.796 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And because as this
young man comes to me,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:84%
he brings me your
mind and he said,

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.764 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling her I'm with her.

00:33:02.764 --> 00:33:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling her
that I'm with her.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Please bring this to my mother.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They said to me I had to bring
her proof so he's bringing you

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:90%
proof.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So I know that there would be--

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.642 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at that
second or third bookshelf,

00:33:11.642 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:84%
there'd definitely be
some science books,

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.120 align:middle line:84%
there'd definitely be some
calculus books or some kind

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of mechanical engineering
type of books.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.868 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:33:18.868 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you'd be a
person of numbers around you.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.015 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:33:22.015 --> 00:33:23.056 align:middle line:90%
There's measures to that.

00:33:23.056 --> 00:33:24.420 align:middle line:90%
That formula goes with that.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:24.940 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.753 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:33:26.753 --> 00:33:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that you would have
also had been with this lady

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.090 align:middle line:90%
in passing, his mother.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.484 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of in passing or
you know something about her.

00:33:34.484 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.733 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, I'd also be
very, very aware as he gives me

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:40.300 align:middle line:84%
a sense that there could
be a book that you have,

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
a program, a book,
and there could

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.410 align:middle line:90%
be these people at the school.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:45.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.735 align:middle line:84%
And there might be pictures
of people at the school,

00:33:47.735 --> 00:33:49.915 align:middle line:84%
of students that have
passed-- students

00:33:49.915 --> 00:33:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that are there that have
passed through the school.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.214 align:middle line:90%
Would you know about that?

00:33:53.214 --> 00:33:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:54.713 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:33:54.713 --> 00:33:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And would you know
if that program--

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.190 align:middle line:90%
that manual-- is in a spiral?

00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:59.804 align:middle line:84%
Comes to me in a
spiral kind of--

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It is.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.621 align:middle line:90%
So I know that I'm seeing that.

00:34:02.621 --> 00:34:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very aware
that his photograph

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:90%
would be in there.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And I go toward-- this man
makes me go toward the end

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:84%
part of the book or three
quarters through that program.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.590 align:middle line:84%
I must tell you that his
passing is very quick

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:15.495 align:middle line:90%
and it's very fast.

00:34:15.495 --> 00:34:16.161 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't
feel any lingering.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel pain with him.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm gone.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's gone.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.338 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:22.338 --> 00:34:24.496 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you, though,
he's a very soulful boy.

00:34:24.496 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
He's a very soulful
boy, and he's

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:27.389 align:middle line:90%
received a lot of the prayers.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:28.580 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the prayers.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, can I be also--
the healing that you

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.678 align:middle line:84%
did in that meditation,
he was right with you.

00:34:33.678 --> 00:34:34.469 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.834 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did
you see him, please?

00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:36.699 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:90%
That's just confirmation.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:38.405 align:middle line:90%
That's just confirmation.

00:34:38.405 --> 00:34:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.995 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:90%
Great, great, great.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:41.937 align:middle line:84%
And please bring that
healing to his mother.

00:34:41.937 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
The family needs it.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that he has a sister,

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
so I want you to bring
it to his sister as well.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:47.804 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of that.

00:34:47.804 --> 00:34:49.219 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I know also, as I
work with you here,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady who
comes in who is a nun.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Who's a nun, and very much
a religious nun feeling.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I see that
as a guide with you,

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I see that you're a very
compassionate person.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you've done
a really, really good job

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.534 align:middle line:84%
balancing the left
and right brains.

00:35:05.534 --> 00:35:06.575 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I work on it.

00:35:06.575 --> 00:35:07.741 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, I love it.

00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I think you're doing a
really, really good job.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:10.940 align:middle line:90%
Really, really good job.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And your dad has
also passed over?

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:14.378 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No?

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I have a man who was
recognized as a father to me

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:90%
so I got to tell you that.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And I see horses
around him, and I

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.160 align:middle line:84%
got to tell you there's
an area growing up

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:90%
with horses and countryside.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:22.795 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: True.

00:35:22.795 --> 00:35:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:90%
That's just a--

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:24.638 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:35:24.638 --> 00:35:25.310 align:middle line:90%
So true.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just a validation.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Don't know if you were
adopted or what happened, or--

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Have you
lost touch with him?

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:30.678 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:30.678 --> 00:35:31.678 align:middle line:90%
My father was Holocaust.

00:35:31.678 --> 00:35:33.302 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah, it
was the Holocaust.

00:35:33.302 --> 00:35:34.126 align:middle line:90%
Oh, God bless you.

00:35:34.126 --> 00:35:34.625 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:36.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, he comes in
very, very strongly.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I lost 50 members of my
family in the Holocaust,

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.600 align:middle line:90%
so I can relate to that.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that that's
the reference that comes in.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So I know this man
shows me horses.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I know this man has a farm.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.374 align:middle line:84%
I know this man has a
countryside of life.

00:35:49.374 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot
of women over there

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:90%
on that side of the family.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.443 align:middle line:84%
There'd be, like, I
don't know, about eight?

00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Eight women over there
on the other side.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
they are aunts of his,

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:84%
but there's a whole
bunch of them.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's wonderful.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.278 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:35:59.278 --> 00:36:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this man, your
father, is very proud of you

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and wants you to live
your life as if-- what?

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:90%
The moment's now.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:08.710 align:middle line:90%
The moment's now.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:90%
The moment's now.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't live in the past.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Don't live in the future.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Live now.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.559 align:middle line:90%
That's very good advice.

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
In your room, that room
that we're talking about,

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.130 align:middle line:84%
are there photographs on
the wall of any people

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.020 align:middle line:90%
that have passed over?

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:23.438 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No.

00:36:23.438 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Are there any photos
of people on the wall?

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Or where is it?

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes, there are.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.348 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:36:28.348 --> 00:36:29.924 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm being
shown that my mind.

00:36:29.924 --> 00:36:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that I want

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to bring healing
to these people.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
people need healing,

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and would you please keep
them in your prayers.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:38.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think you're
a very prayerful person.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.303 align:middle line:84%
I think you have--
I don't know if you

00:36:40.303 --> 00:36:41.730 align:middle line:90%
have Beatitudes on your wall?

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:90%
That prayer Beatitudes?

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.670 align:middle line:90%
You do, don't you?

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, I do.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I see it.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Beatitudes.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.694 align:middle line:90%
Right there on the wall.

00:36:46.694 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's right there,
and I love that for you.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:50.599 align:middle line:84%
This nun comes in
here, not a relative

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:84%
of yours necessarily, but
definitely a spiritual family

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:53.509 align:middle line:90%
of yours.

00:36:53.509 --> 00:36:54.550 align:middle line:90%
I got to say that to you.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I think you're
a great one in compassion,

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.734 align:middle line:84%
and I think you could
teach compassion.

00:36:58.734 --> 00:36:59.839 align:middle line:90%
I really, really do.

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I think you're great with that.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I also feel there's
a lost brother.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Or a brother that's
gone somewhere from you.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.453 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what means, if
you've havne't spoken to him

00:37:06.453 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:90%
in a while, but a lost brother.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.930 align:middle line:90%
They say a lost brother.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.852 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And your dad
wants me to mention that to you.

00:37:11.852 --> 00:37:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you've
just lead different lives,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.226 align:middle line:84%
completely different lives,
that you've lost contact

00:37:16.226 --> 00:37:18.659 align:middle line:84%
with each other, but your
father's trying to help you--

00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think you know
your father very well?

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But I know that he
knows you very well,

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:90%
and I know that I want to-- OK.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to be with
you with gardening.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.770 align:middle line:90%
The gardening.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
that you love the gardens,

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and I know that you've
created a memorial

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.610 align:middle line:90%
garden for your father.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.781 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he wants
to thank you for that.

00:37:35.781 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And I love lilies; I love
tulips; I love roses.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:90%
I love all that.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.095 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:37:39.095 --> 00:37:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know, you
are very gifted with nurturing,

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:90%
that earth energy.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.861 align:middle line:90%
Very, very gifted that way.

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she also has a
vegetable garden?

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, he said you have a
vegetable garden, too,

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:47.535 align:middle line:90%
in the right season.

00:37:47.535 --> 00:37:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
said that to me.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:90%
He said your-- OK.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.970 align:middle line:84%
He said your tomatoes
are very big this year.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And prolific.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And prolific.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he's saying that to me.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:56.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Prolific.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very good.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:57.839 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:57.839 --> 00:37:58.645 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:37:58.645 --> 00:38:00.759 align:middle line:84%
So keep on doing what
you do, and continue

00:38:00.759 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:90%
with that teaching.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And would you please help
that Thomas family, please?

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.110 align:middle line:90%
For him.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I will.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.030 align:middle line:84%

>>VAN PRAAGH: God bless you.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:90%


00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Interesting work, isn't it?

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.104 align:middle line:90%
Interesting work.

00:38:15.104 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So a lady comes into my
mind, and as this lady comes

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.680 align:middle line:84%
to my mind, she's talking
about her daughter being

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.330 align:middle line:84%
in the audience here,
and I know that I

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.804 align:middle line:90%
want to talk about scissors.

00:38:22.804 --> 00:38:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So I know I want to
talk about scissors.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure if my
daughter is sitting here

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.722 align:middle line:84%
in this room having my--
who owns my scissors now.

00:38:28.722 --> 00:38:31.055 align:middle line:84%
This lady is making me feel
something about the scissors

00:38:31.055 --> 00:38:33.850 align:middle line:84%
or shears, and I got
to talk about that.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I am also talking
about my sewing stuff.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking
to me about that,

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know where I am.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.965 align:middle line:84%
Does it make sense
to anybody here?

00:38:41.965 --> 00:38:43.181 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense to you?

00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.870 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name, lovely?

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Carol.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Carol.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Carol.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:90%
So you know about-- go on.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:90%
She's never come through before.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
She said this is brand new for
her so please bear with her,

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.785 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She's been
trying really, really hard

00:38:56.785 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
to come through to you and
other members of the family.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:90%
I've got to say that.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And you would know about having
her scissors or her shears?

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
several of her scissors.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And would she have been
into the sewing situation?

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.220 align:middle line:90%
This lady?

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She gave
me her sewing machine.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She gave
you a sewing machine.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is your
mother or stepmother?

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Stepmother.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Stepmother, great.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.034 align:middle line:84%
So to me it like feels
like a mother here.

00:39:16.034 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I know she comes with that--
got you, got you, got you.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.102 align:middle line:90%
Slow down.

00:39:19.102 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
She's very, very
excited to speak to you.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.447 align:middle line:84%
You have my scissors, and
you recently looked at them.

00:39:23.447 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:84%
You were recently looking
at my scissors, correct?

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's this
gentleman coming in

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.040 align:middle line:84%
over here, like a
father coming in.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So I got to tell you a
father's over here in a second.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.302 align:middle line:90%
He'll be just with you.

00:39:32.302 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
He said he was just with
you in the meditation,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and he said he'll
come in just a second,

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.960 align:middle line:84%
but this lady's got
to come through.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.090 align:middle line:84%
This stepmother's got
to come through here.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So they must have been
together obviously.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Duh.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.182 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They are.

00:39:42.182 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And I like her.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.500 align:middle line:90%
I like her a lot, this lady.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I just want to give more
of my space and my mind.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.075 align:middle line:84%
And as she comes in, I
like to do my sewing.

00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:52.540 align:middle line:84%
She's all about the sewing,
she's all about crafts,

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and she's all about
that sort of thing.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
do you know about--

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:90%
and this is a weird one.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a weird one, but I got
to go with what I'm hearing.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.152 align:middle line:90%
Remember those paper dolls?

00:40:02.152 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.109 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cutting
the paper dolls?

00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why she's
giving me that in my mind,

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
but she's giving me a memory
of making paper dolls.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:84%
My sister and I did that
when we were a lot younger.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
the kids have grown up,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.410 align:middle line:84%
but there's still a
little one somewhere.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if that's
a great grandchild.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And would this great grandchild
be around seven years of age

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:90%
or five years of age?

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.496 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:40:27.496 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Would you please pass on
the tradition of the dolls?

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:90%
The cutting paper dolls?

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that strange?

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It is strange.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.791 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But they
want you to do that.

00:40:35.791 --> 00:40:36.944 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:40:36.944 --> 00:40:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So this mother figure is coming
and telling me about that.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm also getting, as your
dad comes closer, he has--

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.600 align:middle line:84%
you have your mother's--
stepmother's ring.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Her wedding ring.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:84%
You look at that every
once in a while, don't you?

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.015 align:middle line:90%
And do you have a son, please?

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.621 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You worry
too much about him.

00:40:53.621 --> 00:40:55.851 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.851 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Dad says you worry way
too much about him.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.225 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:58.225 --> 00:41:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So remember,
when you're sending out energy,

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
send out worry,

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:84%
because it'll bring
the energy down.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.404 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:05.404 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So when
we send out worry,

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.945 align:middle line:84%
when we send out
negativity, when we send out

00:41:08.945 --> 00:41:12.195 align:middle line:84%
limited thoughts, we bring
the energy down to fear.

00:41:12.195 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.403 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you don't want that,

00:41:14.403 --> 00:41:16.220 align:middle line:90%
because you don't want dis-ease.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.956 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:41:16.956 --> 00:41:17.352 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:41:17.352 --> 00:41:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So you want to bring up to the
love and high level of energy,

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.450 align:middle line:90%
yeah?

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So your dad is
telling me he's with your boy.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:24.752 align:middle line:90%
He's helping the son out.

00:41:24.752 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's
emotional problems going on

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.380 align:middle line:84%
back and forth
with him, and he's

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.780 align:middle line:84%
got to find something
else about himself.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I understand.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.498 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:31.498 --> 00:41:33.620 align:middle line:90%
And-- hold on, hold on.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.780 align:middle line:90%
You have a husband also.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.206 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's passed.

00:41:38.206 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.620 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.897 align:middle line:90%
That's my specialty.

00:41:42.897 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:90%
That's my specialty.

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.790 align:middle line:90%
May I bring him through for you?

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:49.496 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:49.496 --> 00:41:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.249 align:middle line:90%
What is his same?

00:41:51.249 --> 00:41:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Robert.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Robert.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Robert's been
hanging out all day.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.152 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:41:55.152 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Now I just want to bring him
through and let him come in.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So I know that he's telling
me-- acknowledging him.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.027 align:middle line:90%
He's thanking them.

00:42:02.027 --> 00:42:03.110 align:middle line:90%
He's thanking the parents.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.060 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of aunts and
uncles there, too, by the way.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.601 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
people that didn't

00:42:06.601 --> 00:42:09.080 align:middle line:84%
really were blood people,
but belonged to that family.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:90%
I just got to say.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like one big happy--

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
This guy that comes
through, Robert, I

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
want to tell you that there's
a lot of animals he's around.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I just want to tell you
there's dogs over there.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a farmer.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he has
animals, but there's dogs.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Like, three dogs.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Dogs.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:20.311 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:20.311 --> 00:42:21.934 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Three
dogs, specifically.

00:42:21.934 --> 00:42:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Three dogs.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.895 align:middle line:84%
And as I want to say to him--
he's talking about the son.

00:42:24.895 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
if that's a son

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:84%
that he had with somebody
else or that's your son.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:28.880 align:middle line:90%
It's your son.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We had a son, yeah.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.548 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The same one that
you worry about.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.400 align:middle line:90%
So stop worrying about him.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His
name is Robert, too.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: His
name is Robert, too.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So I know that I'm
taking care of him.

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.418 align:middle line:84%
I know your husband's
taking care of him.

00:42:38.418 --> 00:42:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that I feel--
I got to tell you

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that I feel when this man
left you a long time ago.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:90%
It feels like a bit ago.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if there
was still a lot

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of unfinished business
between you and him.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:49.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
I want to say I'm sorry to you,

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and I know that he did
things that I'm not

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:54.850 align:middle line:90%
very proud of doing.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.170 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I know I did
not honor you like I

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:90%
should have as a husband.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is what he's
just saying to you.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
He has to get this off his chest
for this healing to happen.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying,
please forgive me.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.025 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:06.733 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:43:06.733 --> 00:43:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Please forgive him, sweetheart.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I forgive you.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:09.618 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:43:09.618 --> 00:43:10.360 align:middle line:90%
She forgives you.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
think he knew better.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.567 align:middle line:90%
I don't think he knew better.

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
sense of not being

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
aware of who he was, and
unfortunately acted out

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.450 align:middle line:84%
certain ways and did things
that were not appropriate.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:22.880 align:middle line:90%
And he's sorry.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:84%
He misses you
cooking food for him.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
When you first got married, and
you cooked him perfect meals.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
You used to do perfect
things for him,

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and he's telling me about
go back to those memories.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:32.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:34.285 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I like
spaghetti and meatballs.

00:43:34.285 --> 00:43:36.451 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why, but I
like spaghetti and meatballs

00:43:36.451 --> 00:43:37.540 align:middle line:90%
when I'm younger.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to leave you with
those-- that information.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.263 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:43:40.263 --> 00:43:44.957 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.957 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you, please?

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:48.671 align:middle line:90%
And your name is?

00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:49.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Bonnie.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Bonnie.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a gentleman
that passed over

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:90%
you want to contact?

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.276 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:53.276 --> 00:43:53.970 align:middle line:90%
My friend Kip.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your friend Kip.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.055 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there's
a man, but there's also

00:43:56.055 --> 00:43:58.096 align:middle line:84%
a lady coming in next to
you on this side of you.

00:43:58.096 --> 00:44:00.774 align:middle line:84%
And I feel more like a
grandmotherly feeling.

00:44:00.774 --> 00:44:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I get-- or I feel like it's
almost like an older woman who

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.620 align:middle line:90%
helped at one time in life.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And I feel she's
older in life, and I

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.229 align:middle line:90%
think you helped her one time.

00:44:08.229 --> 00:44:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if it's a
relationship with your family

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.520 align:middle line:84%
or with you, but I know you
did a nicety for this lady

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.320 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think she's a
friend of your mother's.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It
could be my grandma.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.784 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is
this your mother?

00:44:19.784 --> 00:44:20.285 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:44:20.285 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I never
met her before

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.080 align:middle line:90%
but-- did she have white hair?

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.334 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
have her blanket?

00:44:25.334 --> 00:44:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.041 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, you do.

00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:28.794 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing up?

00:44:28.794 --> 00:44:30.210 align:middle line:84%
You both can stand
up, sweetheart.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know
that this lady is here.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking
about her, and she

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.233 align:middle line:90%
talks about she has others, too.

00:44:36.233 --> 00:44:37.814 align:middle line:84%
Are there two other
kids you have?

00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.000 align:middle line:90%
Two other girls.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two other girls.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:39.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.970 align:middle line:90%
So there are three altogether?

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Because she tells about the two
other kids, she's telling me.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:45.095 align:middle line:84%
I also know your father would
be in the spirit world as well,

00:44:45.095 --> 00:44:45.280 align:middle line:90%
correct?

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I get the gentleman

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:47.751 align:middle line:90%
that she comes here with.

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And he stands on your left
side and she's on right side.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Did you have crocheted
blankets somewhere?

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Or someone that made a blanket?

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.206 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:44:54.206 --> 00:44:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
whose blanket is that?

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Pam.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Pam.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Who's Pam?

00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Pam would
be my sister-in-law.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:44:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
sister-in-law.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Who passed.

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
whose blanket you have?

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.228 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:03.228 --> 00:45:04.914 align:middle line:84%
And did you think
of her recently?

00:45:04.914 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.664 align:middle line:84%
And did you want to
thank her recently?

00:45:07.664 --> 00:45:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she
said you thanked me recently.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.850 align:middle line:84%
You came through to
say thank you to me.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
lady, Pam-- and I'll

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.140 align:middle line:84%
get to-- your mother's
right here, too.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And your father's over here.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say, Pam,
you helped her a lot.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know why, but
it's when you helped her.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So was she in a hospital
before she passes over, please?

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She was.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:25.825 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
was, wasn't she?

00:45:25.825 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.326 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I get
this lady coming in to me

00:45:27.326 --> 00:45:28.320 align:middle line:90%
as a hospital feeling.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I feel very ill.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.334 align:middle line:84%
I feel the energy's
being drawn out of me.

00:45:31.334 --> 00:45:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure it's a
cancerous condition,

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.990 align:middle line:90%
but I feel it could have been.

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.246 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:34.246 --> 00:45:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
feel like we tried

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.690 align:middle line:84%
all different types of
methods to get me better,

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and different types of
things, but I didn't make it.

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:40.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.217 align:middle line:84%
I also feel there might
be two kids involved here

00:45:42.217 --> 00:45:43.550 align:middle line:90%
so she might have had some kids.

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She did
have some children.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Boys.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two kids?

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.001 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:45:46.001 --> 00:45:47.541 align:middle line:84%
And would you let
them know I'm fine?

00:45:47.541 --> 00:45:48.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.193 align:middle line:84%
But you wants to thank you
for your help with her.

00:45:50.193 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, even if it was on the
telephone, you helped her.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.584 align:middle line:90%
You listened.

00:45:54.584 --> 00:45:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You helped her.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:90%
You listened to her, didn't you?

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.414 align:middle line:90%
Because you were her voice.

00:45:59.414 --> 00:46:01.566 align:middle line:84%
You heard her voice,
and you listened.

00:46:01.566 --> 00:46:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you for that.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you
that, all right?

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's
very proud of you,

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.962 align:middle line:84%
and your mother is also coming
through apologizing to you.

00:46:08.962 --> 00:46:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why she's
coming to apologize to you,

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.340 align:middle line:90%
but she has to say I'm sorry.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: This is
probably my birth mother.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, she's really
apologizing to you

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:90%
that she wasn't there for you.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.310 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
there are photographs of me

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.840 align:middle line:90%
that you don't know who I am.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I feel that
this lady was not everything

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:90%
that she could be for you.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.589 align:middle line:90%
But I forgive her.

00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'm getting from
her point of view.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Her point of view.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if she feels she
couldn't do enough for you when

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.470 align:middle line:84%
she was younger, and she
wished she could've been,

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.095 align:middle line:90%
but she wasn't.

00:46:41.095 --> 00:46:42.160 align:middle line:90%
And you understand that?

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I want to jump into the
father saying he loves you.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.828 align:middle line:84%
Your dad's saying he
loves you very much.

00:46:46.828 --> 00:46:50.004 align:middle line:84%
When you hear him whistle,
his specific type of whistle.

00:46:50.004 --> 00:46:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
you'll know it's him.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Make sense?

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what he wants
to come through with.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to come through
also with someone

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.770 align:middle line:84%
over here that you
went to school with.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, would that be this person
Kip you went to school with?

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Your friend that passed away?

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.334 align:middle line:90%
This guy that passed?

00:47:04.334 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You can
stay standing, mom,

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.230 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
back and forth here.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We went
to school together.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You went
to school together.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.526 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there'd be
a connection with a school

00:47:11.526 --> 00:47:12.880 align:middle line:90%
as I connect with this person.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.089 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
something also about career.

00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:16.796 align:middle line:84%
Or we're talking to
each other about what

00:47:16.796 --> 00:47:18.715 align:middle line:84%
jobs to do, what
career we're going to,

00:47:18.715 --> 00:47:20.090 align:middle line:84%
what jobs we're
going to go into.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have this--
it's a man, correct?

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:26.661 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you
have his voice on tape

00:47:26.661 --> 00:47:29.250 align:middle line:84%
or do you have something
that-- his voice of his?

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.769 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I used to listen
to his cell phone voicemail.

00:47:31.769 --> 00:47:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.860 align:middle line:90%
He said you still have my voice.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.730 align:middle line:84%
You listen to my voice, and
it's still very real for you.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:41.466 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there was
more to it than this friends,

00:47:41.466 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:84%
that there's a little
bit more to this.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.525 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I feel it could

00:47:45.525 --> 00:47:47.014 align:middle line:90%
have been a romantic connection.

00:47:47.014 --> 00:47:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.858 align:middle line:84%
I also think that there might
have been a connection as far

00:47:50.858 --> 00:47:52.940 align:middle line:84%
as partnering
together or getting

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.290 align:middle line:90%
married or something like that.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:55.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.405 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:55.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Absolutely.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:58.071 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when
he comes in here,

00:47:58.071 --> 00:48:00.790 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense of a wedding or
a sense of connection with you.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:01.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this-- shortly
before that something happens,

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.430 align:middle line:90%
and he's gone.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.570 align:middle line:90%
So I got to tell you that.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It was very sudden.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.286 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A fast
passing, wasn't it?

00:48:11.286 --> 00:48:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Drug overdose.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.631 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't
tell me; I'll tell you.

00:48:14.631 --> 00:48:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.368 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:48:16.368 --> 00:48:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you this.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Tattoos.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So he's talking to
me about tattoos.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So I know I got to
talk about a tattoo.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I think he had tattoos,
and I think you either

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.290 align:middle line:84%
want to get a tattoo
with his name on it

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:25.020 align:middle line:90%
or something about a tattoo.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
one on my hand.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have one on your hand.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:27.770 align:middle line:90%
With his name on it?

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:28.890 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
he's talking about.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Got that.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.599 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:48:31.599 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:84%
He's right with
you all the time.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So you're still a part-- what?

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:35.590 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.964 align:middle line:84%
So in the back of
your head, when

00:48:36.964 --> 00:48:39.170 align:middle line:84%
you feel a little headache
coming on, that's him.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.058 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I got you, Kip.

00:48:41.058 --> 00:48:43.325 align:middle line:84%
So when you-- when
we talked about you

00:48:43.325 --> 00:48:45.805 align:middle line:84%
bringing a guide next to
you, behind you, he came in.

00:48:45.805 --> 00:48:46.732 align:middle line:90%
Do you see him?

00:48:46.732 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I feel him.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And I know that he's so funny.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:54.510 align:middle line:90%
He's so gross, in his own way.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:57.856 align:middle line:84%
Like, toenails and the
whole gross toenail thing.

00:48:57.856 --> 00:49:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't why he's talking about
gross toenails, but he is.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.445 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of like funny,
goofy kind of gross,

00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:04.450 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:04.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like he'll say
things that no one's thinking--

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Just to get,
like, a rise out of people.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.360 align:middle line:84%
He comes in with that
energy like, ooh.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.990 align:middle line:90%
This sort of thing, OK?

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:90%
So I got to say that.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel with this
gentleman-- I like I'm a lot.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I like him a lot.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.664 align:middle line:90%
Who was the DJ?

00:49:19.664 --> 00:49:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My friend Mandy.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:21.996 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Somebody DJ'd.

00:49:21.996 --> 00:49:24.310 align:middle line:90%


00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And he's around all
the time the DJ person.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.430 align:middle line:90%
He's around the DJ person.

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mandy.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mandy.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that that's a woman, then?

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.579 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:32.579 --> 00:49:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I know the she's
just-- I don't know

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.065 align:middle line:84%
if she goes from job to job
to job or gig to gig to gig,

00:49:37.065 --> 00:49:38.440 align:middle line:84%
but he's been
helping her at gigs

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.090 align:middle line:90%
because she's been low lately.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And he's telling me that.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.835 align:middle line:84%
And would you let
her know he's OK?

00:49:42.835 --> 00:49:44.170 align:middle line:90%
That he's fine?

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want you
crying at my photo anymore.

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you crying at
my photo anymore, he said.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm
going with this man

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if he's so damn
sure of himself sometimes.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:90%
He's so stubborn.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like, don't
you have a heart?

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to say
he's just like go, go, go,

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and he doesn't listen
to your feelings.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.120 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't listen emotionally.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he had a
father when he was younger.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think his father
was present for him.

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.485 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know as he lives his life

00:50:11.485 --> 00:50:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and he manifests
things in his life,

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.200 align:middle line:84%
that he had that
absence of a father.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.500 align:middle line:84%
He had the absence of
really receiving love

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.880 align:middle line:84%
from that male figure
that he looked up to,

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and he really needed that.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.950 align:middle line:90%
I know that this boy is in pain.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know, mom, that you
tried helping him in some ways.

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I know you did, because
he's thanking you so much.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.100 align:middle line:90%
He's thanking you so much.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.375 align:middle line:84%
And I know you must have
given him money sometimes.

00:50:35.375 --> 00:50:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I know you must have
given him money.

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You know that, and he's
thanking you for that.

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:84%
He's thanking you for
that, because it really

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.220 align:middle line:90%
meant a lot to him.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:46.271 align:middle line:84%
And you really saw the goodness
of him when everyone else

00:50:46.271 --> 00:50:46.770 align:middle line:90%
didn't.

00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.470 align:middle line:90%
You saw the goodness in him.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:51.892 align:middle line:84%
And you're like--
grace of God go me.

00:50:51.892 --> 00:50:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.485 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
wouldn't be a bit surprised

00:50:53.485 --> 00:50:54.650 align:middle line:90%
if he even used that term.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.540 align:middle line:90%
But for the grace of God go me.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for the flowers.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.825 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you planted
some flowers, but your flowers.

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
think you for that.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I leave
flowers all the time.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do?

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
leave flowers, yes.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.836 align:middle line:84%
He comes to you
with flowers, too.

00:51:07.836 --> 00:51:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you smell flowers
in the air, it's him.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.814 align:middle line:84%
I know he had a car
that never worked.

00:51:12.814 --> 00:51:13.575 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:13.575 --> 00:51:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He had a
car that never worked.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said he doesn't
need cars anymore.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.060 align:middle line:90%
He's healed.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.812 align:middle line:84%
He's healed himself
in the spirit world.

00:51:20.812 --> 00:51:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I think he learns fast.

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:22.978 align:middle line:90%
He learns very, very quickly.

00:51:22.978 --> 00:51:24.827 align:middle line:90%
He's learning about poisons.

00:51:24.827 --> 00:51:25.660 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.120 align:middle line:90%
He said poison in the body.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.120 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Putting poisons in the body.

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.454 align:middle line:90%
So the drugs probably.

00:51:31.454 --> 00:51:32.870 align:middle line:84%
But I know he's
worked with groups

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of people on the other side,
and he's a fast learner.

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:36.334 align:middle line:90%
He's gone back to school.

00:51:36.334 --> 00:51:38.750 align:middle line:84%
He's finally finishing school,
because he didn't finish it

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.350 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I think he dropped out in his
third year of high school?

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.379 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:51:43.379 --> 00:51:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Third year of high
school dropped out of.

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.558 align:middle line:84%
And he said to tell you that
I'm finishing up school.

00:51:48.558 --> 00:51:50.660 align:middle line:84%
You'd be very proud, and
I got to tell you that.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Is his mom still alive?

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would you
let her know I'm with her

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and thank her for me please?

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Please thank
her, because he's really--

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and your family helped to
bring him in, by the way.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.643 align:middle line:90%
Your family helped bring him in.

00:52:01.643 --> 00:52:03.170 align:middle line:90%
So, he loves you very much.

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.478 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you living
your life for me.

00:52:05.478 --> 00:52:08.370 align:middle line:84%
He said you got to live
your life for yourself, OK?

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:09.640 align:middle line:90%
Are you not remarried now?

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.075 align:middle line:90%
Are you married?

00:52:10.075 --> 00:52:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:10.940 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.036 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:52:11.036 --> 00:52:12.244 align:middle line:90%
We want you to get remarried.

00:52:12.244 --> 00:52:14.320 align:middle line:84%
He wants you to find
another love in your life.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We really want that
healing to happen.

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.082 align:middle line:90%
So for you and for him.

00:52:18.082 --> 00:52:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:19.539 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:19.539 --> 00:52:20.256 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:52:20.256 --> 00:52:21.005 align:middle line:90%
No, he's not dead.

00:52:21.005 --> 00:52:22.029 align:middle line:90%
He's very much alive.

00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:23.070 align:middle line:90%
So think of him that way.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:24.020 align:middle line:90%
As a guide.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.509 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:52:27.509 --> 00:52:30.862 align:middle line:90%


00:52:30.862 --> 00:52:32.070 align:middle line:90%
I want to come to the father.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Your father passed over?

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:33.860 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Amy.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Amy.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Why do you worry, honey?

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Why can't you bring
healing to yourself?

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you be happy?

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:44.714 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Good question.

00:52:44.714 --> 00:52:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good question.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.963 align:middle line:84%
I just think that you have
a lot of other people's

00:52:47.963 --> 00:52:51.330 align:middle line:84%
energy in your space, and you
try to be something you're not.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we always continue
living life that way,

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:90%
we'll never be happy.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.529 align:middle line:84%
We just got to be
who we are instead

00:52:56.529 --> 00:52:59.201 align:middle line:84%
of being what other
people expect.

00:52:59.201 --> 00:53:00.200 align:middle line:90%
You're married, are you?

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.206 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:01.206 --> 00:53:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does your husband
support you and acknowledge you

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:04.714 align:middle line:90%
and be there for you?

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.129 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Embrace
you and empower you?

00:53:07.129 --> 00:53:07.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I like that for you.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.214 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:53:10.214 --> 00:53:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that-- is
your mother still living

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:12.674 align:middle line:90%
on the earth?

00:53:12.674 --> 00:53:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.342 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
this man comes

00:53:14.342 --> 00:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
in, your father's coming
in here, I got to tell,

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:16.890 align:middle line:90%
dad comes in here.

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:18.801 align:middle line:84%
He's concerned
about your mother.

00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So he's concerned
about your mother.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.510 align:middle line:84%
She's often talking to
dead people he said.

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking to dead people,
and she's talking in her mind

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and she's seeing them and
she's talking to them a lot.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.912 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:53:28.912 --> 00:53:30.703 align:middle line:84%
Is there a sister of
her's that passed over

00:53:30.703 --> 00:53:31.850 align:middle line:90%
to the world of the spirit?

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I get your father
coming through for you,

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.120 align:middle line:84%
he's worried about your mom
so I got to tell you that.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.078 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that he's
trying to help things out

00:53:39.078 --> 00:53:41.530 align:middle line:84%
with the family as far as
moving her around or changing

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:84%
the way she is or
this sort of a thing?

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.059 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:53:45.059 --> 00:53:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
going on right now

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.280 align:middle line:84%
about where she's
living or who's

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.420 align:middle line:90%
going to take care of her?

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:49.765 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:49.765 --> 00:53:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
your father is on about.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.569 align:middle line:90%
He's talking to me about that.

00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said you're going
to have to do that.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:57.335 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:57.335 --> 00:54:00.094 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want to do
that before she falls down.

00:54:00.094 --> 00:54:01.002 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:01.002 --> 00:54:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.251 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a conversation
you recently had with someone.

00:54:04.251 --> 00:54:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.300 align:middle line:90%
You got to answer.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:09.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in your head.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:11.143 align:middle line:90%
You got to yes or no, all right?

00:54:11.143 --> 00:54:11.942 align:middle line:90%
I'll take nos, too.

00:54:11.942 --> 00:54:12.900 align:middle line:90%
You just got to answer.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Ok.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I want
to be respectful to them.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:17.490 align:middle line:84%
He comes through really, really
hard to try and help you.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.656 align:middle line:84%
And he knows that you--
there might be some problems

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:21.240 align:middle line:84%
with-- there is a
sister or a brother?

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.114 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Brothers.

00:54:22.114 --> 00:54:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Brothers.

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
why, but I can't

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.485 align:middle line:84%
get them to hear what
I want them to hear.

00:54:27.485 --> 00:54:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you can't
get through to your brothers

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:30.832 align:middle line:90%
about your mother.

00:54:30.832 --> 00:54:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Is there something going
on with that, correct?

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I don't know who's

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:35.350 align:middle line:90%
in control of the checkbook.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Is your brother in
control of the checkbook?

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
recently your father said

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.800 align:middle line:84%
there are some problems
with the monies

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.380 align:middle line:84%
or payments or the checks or
getting her financial stuff

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:44.890 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:48.370 align:middle line:84%
He's been trying
to help over here.

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Who's the oldest son?

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mark.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mark.

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that he likes-- well,
he loves-- but all three

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:55.774 align:middle line:90%
very differently.

00:54:55.774 --> 00:54:57.440 align:middle line:84%
All three are very,
very different kids.

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But
it's the older one

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that he's having a
little trouble with.

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:02.098 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the older one seems
to be the financial guy.

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:07.520 align:middle line:84%
In charge of things or
wanting to get things.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't know what
he's doing, your father said.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.782 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:15.782 --> 00:55:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Go ahead.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He's not in
charge of the financial end,

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.220 align:middle line:84%
but he's really
having challenges

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.202 align:middle line:84%
with some of the other
things in managing.

00:55:23.202 --> 00:55:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And who's the one in
charge of the finances?

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My
other brother, Jay.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
second brother?

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.568 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the first
brother and the second brother

00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:31.190 align:middle line:90%
get along.

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:32.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That is correct.

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because your father

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is having trouble with
the two of those boys.

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's trying
to get them to get together,

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.710 align:middle line:90%
and they're not.

00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And that-- what?

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.989 align:middle line:84%
He's really-- Dad is really
pissed off about this.

00:55:40.989 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:90%
He's pissed off about it.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, he is.

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:46.687 align:middle line:84%
He said, would those two fools
get their heads on straight?

00:55:46.687 --> 00:55:47.770 align:middle line:90%
That's how he's saying it.

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:49.853 align:middle line:84%
Would those two fools get
their heads on straight?

00:55:49.853 --> 00:55:51.096 align:middle line:90%
Now, who lost a kidney?

00:55:51.096 --> 00:55:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Who had problems with a
kidney or kidney breakdown?

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.504 align:middle line:90%
Kidneys broke down?

00:55:54.504 --> 00:55:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: An old
friend of mine.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: An old friend
of yours that passed over?

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is it
a woman that passed

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:01.034 align:middle line:84%
over who had the kidney
dialysis or kidney problems?

00:56:01.034 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Many years ago.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.788 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that she
must have kidney problems

00:56:04.788 --> 00:56:06.163 align:middle line:84%
or lost one kidney,
specifically,

00:56:06.163 --> 00:56:07.787 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like
I want to say hello

00:56:07.787 --> 00:56:08.980 align:middle line:90%
from her in the distance.

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.044 align:middle line:84%
And that been around you in that
meditation she was with you.

00:56:12.044 --> 00:56:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you could have
seen her in that meditation.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I did.

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But
she's right around you,

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and let her family know
she's with you, OK?

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I got
to tell you that.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.946 align:middle line:84%
Your father is saying I'm
trying to work things out,

00:56:20.946 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:84%
but one most
important thing is-- I

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.690 align:middle line:84%
know he passed away in a
hospital setting of some kind.

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I know he's in a hospital bed.

00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I know I want to lean
my head upon his chest.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know someone
does that; that

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.210 align:middle line:90%
must've been you doing that.

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:33.626 align:middle line:84%
I know that there
must be machines

00:56:33.626 --> 00:56:35.230 align:middle line:84%
around with him,
which is very common,

00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:84%
but know that it's
my time to go.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:37.867 align:middle line:90%
It's my time to go.

00:56:37.867 --> 00:56:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a military
connection somewhere here as

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.330 align:middle line:84%
well, because I know that he
was in the military at one point

00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:42.840 align:middle line:90%
when he was younger.

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:43.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:44.225 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that there

00:56:44.225 --> 00:56:46.370 align:middle line:84%
are people that come to get him
when it's time for him to come

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.130 align:middle line:84%
over to the other
side who are military.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.130 align:middle line:84%
His platoon or
his group of guys.

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They're all there
waiting for him, OK?

00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I feel very much
honored with this man

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.039 align:middle line:84%
as far as he must have been
a high level in the military

00:56:56.039 --> 00:56:57.830 align:middle line:84%
because they're all,
like, saluting to him.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.204 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:56:59.204 --> 00:57:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, isn't it?

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:01.850 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:57:01.850 --> 00:57:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:57:02.490 --> 00:57:04.010 align:middle line:90%
And the kids always fought.

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Those boys always
fought growing up.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Always fought.

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.955 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would you
tell them to get their heads out

00:57:07.955 --> 00:57:09.897 align:middle line:84%
of their asses
about your mother.

00:57:09.897 --> 00:57:10.980 align:middle line:90%
That's how he's saying it.

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:13.164 align:middle line:84%
I don't speak like that,
at least on television.

00:57:13.164 --> 00:57:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Sound a
little bit like him.

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But it's him.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:15.695 align:middle line:90%
It's him.

00:57:15.695 --> 00:57:16.570 align:middle line:90%
It's his personality.

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:17.800 align:middle line:90%
It's his energy.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you've
got to think of mom.

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:20.940 align:middle line:84%
He wants her to be
in a place that's

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:22.415 align:middle line:84%
safe, because he
doesn't feel she's safe.

00:57:22.415 --> 00:57:24.020 align:middle line:84%
She's going to fall
down, and that's

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.186 align:middle line:90%
going to be the worst thing.

00:57:25.186 --> 00:57:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So you need to put
her somewhere where

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.325 align:middle line:84%
she can go where you
can all look at her, OK?

00:57:29.325 --> 00:57:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:30.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
what you have to do.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:90%
That's his connection.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:33.930 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:34.070 --> 00:57:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you, sweetheart.

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:39.395 align:middle line:90%


00:57:39.395 --> 00:57:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Before I go to bed at night,
one of the things that I do,

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.436 align:middle line:84%
which I'd like to
share with all of you,

00:57:43.436 --> 00:57:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is as I'm falling
about to sleep,

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.970 align:middle line:84%
I think about every
single part of the day

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.065 align:middle line:84%
that I have to send
healing to and someone

00:57:51.065 --> 00:57:52.370 align:middle line:90%
that needs healing in my life.

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine them in that
beautiful green ball of light,

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of healing.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I see the people I made
connection with during the day,

00:57:58.970 --> 00:58:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and I'll send them healing.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Or other people in the
world who need healing.

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.567 align:middle line:90%
And I fall asleep that way.

00:58:04.567 --> 00:58:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a great way to fall asleep.

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So I leave that with
you and all of you.

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, everyone,
very much for being here.

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:10.497 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:58:10.497 --> 00:58:11.580 align:middle line:90%
And all of you, thank you.

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:28.134 align:middle line:90%
