00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.404 align:middle line:84%
>>And now, world renowned
spirit medium, James Van Praagh.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:33.116 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone, hi.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And thank you also for
inviting me into your place.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting,
because as we

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
do this show and
these episodes, I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
have in my mind what I want to
accomplish with each episode.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And each episode
is very different

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.090 align:middle line:84%
because I'm a teacher,
first and foremost.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.764 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
You'll say, well,
you're a medium.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but as a medium,
I'm also a teacher,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
a teacher of the spirit,
a teacher for you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:90%
to remember who you are.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
That you are first and
foremost a soul or a spirit

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.594 align:middle line:84%
having a human experience,
not the other way around.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Can we get that?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Some people are going, what?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really true.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it needs to have

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
a dramatic effect,
some experience

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to happen, hopefully,
that you realize that.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that we
take on that perspective

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that indeed we are
spirits first and foremost

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:90%
having this human experience.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a three
dimensional world,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and really it's a
very linear world.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Time is very linear.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
We have time here.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the reality of who we
truly are, there is no time.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual dimensions,
the spiritual realms,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
which are all around us and
they interpenetrate our three

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
dimensional world,
there is no time.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you leave this body,
you're outside of time.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Did you all get that one?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.875 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.625 align:middle line:84%
I look at some of you
in my audience here,

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.505 align:middle line:84%
And it's great because it's
as if I'm just reminding you

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:04.320 align:middle line:90%
of your truth, right?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.804 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminding you of things that
you know deep down inside you.

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
this that makes sense.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.350 align:middle line:84%
There's something
that clicks here.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
I've heard this before
deep in my soul.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.269 align:middle line:84%
And I always say it's
food for the soul.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
All this information is
food for your soul, stuff

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that you know deep down,
but I'm just reminding you.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So my job, really, I always
feel is I'm the mirror.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.337 align:middle line:84%
I'm holding the mirror up
to show you who you are,

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that you're a spirit having
this human experience,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and that when I bring through
the spirit world, it's, again,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
validation that
there is no death,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're all energy
and we cannot die.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Energy just changes form.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.335 align:middle line:84%
That's really what it's about,
and that's why I'm here today,

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's why
you're here today.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason I
love to do the work I do

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
is because of the life
experiences that I have,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I like to share
with other people,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
because I find that a
lot of the experiences

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
are common experiences, that
we all have them in some way.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.227 align:middle line:84%
So how many people
here-- And experiences,

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to back that up.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The experiences that we
have are not necessarily

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%
limited to the physical body.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of you are spirits
who are outside the body

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:90%
more than are inside the body.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that weird?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.914 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think that's odd?

00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.019 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good, perfect.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Good answer, good answer.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.890 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, really true,
because being a spirit,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
first and foremost, we really
are not limited to this shell.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.590 align:middle line:84%
We are more times out of
the body than in the body,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.449 align:middle line:84%
because we as spirit, pure
consciousness, consciousness

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.615 align:middle line:90%
is not confined in the body.

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:90%
It's outside the body.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So how many people here in
this audience, and you people

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.795 align:middle line:84%
at home watching this, have read
a book and you're going back

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
reading this book
and you say, wait

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
a minute, what just happened
in the chapter before?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
And you got to turn back.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Or now we have Nooks,
and whatever you do,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
go back on the arrow
and see, right?

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:84%
How many of us had
that experience?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.629 align:middle line:90%
Most of us.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you're watching a movie, and
you've got to rewind because,

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:90%
like, what just happened?

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get that, right?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Who had that experience?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.970 align:middle line:84%
The best one is
you're driving along

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
the freeway or the highway,
and all of a sudden, you go,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%
my exit.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there it goes.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.695 align:middle line:90%
Where was I?

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:10.587 align:middle line:84%
So spaced out-- we've heard
that term, spaced out.

00:04:10.587 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that is a
good term, because I

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
do think we're spaced out,
because I think, many times,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:84%
our spirit is outside
that physical body.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:84%
How many people here have
had dreams of your loved ones

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:90%
at night when you go to sleep?

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Mostly all of you, all of you.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because you leave your body,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
your spirit, your soul, will
leave that physical body,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
usually out of the top, the
crown chakra, or the heart

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
chakra-- it goes right out--
and you will be with your loved

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:90%
ones on the other side of life.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:84%
You'll see your teachers,
your family, your guides.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.046 align:middle line:84%
You prepare for new experiences
that are upcoming in your life.

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:90%
You're aware of them.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you go to
school or classes

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for a forthcoming
event in your life.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And many times in the
morning when you wake up,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:90%
you have memories of loved ones.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I was with them, and
it felt more than a dream.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
It was like, I was with them.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.945 align:middle line:84%
It's like a crossover, I call
it, because it's so real.

00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It's so solid.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Our spirit will come back
in the morning to the body,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and we wake up,
and sometimes we're

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.432 align:middle line:84%
exhausted when we
wake up, right?

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
had that experience?

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:90%
All of us.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Like eight hours,
a complete sleep,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
you think great, perfect.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it is is you've
been working on the other side.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Whether visiting your loved
ones, or going to classes,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
talking to your guides, going
to schools, going to meetings,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:90%
happens all the time.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:84%
When I teach a class,
happens all the time.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I swear to you, the next day
in the class, people will say,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream about you on a
school bus or in a classroom,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.484 align:middle line:90%
and you were teaching.

00:05:37.484 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I teach
on the astral level.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.733 align:middle line:90%
I do go in and teach over there.

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very true.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So that brings us to today's
show, which is really

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
a show about out
of body experiences

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
or near death experiences
or actually ways

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
of leaving the body, and
our spirit leaves the body,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and how do we do that?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.064 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to share with
you another experience I had,

00:05:57.064 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
which was a near
death experience.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of those near death
experiences-- Eben Alexander,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Eben Alexander had one,
which many of you are aware of,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:84%
a neurosurgeon, who
went out of his body,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
had experiences
which were very real.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And he met a woman there who
he kind of knew on some level,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:90%
long blond hair.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:90%
There was a recognition.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't tell who,
but he knew this woman

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.162 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

00:06:17.162 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And when he came
back to the earth,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
when we came back into his
body, he found out much later

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
on that that was his twin
sister who he'd never met,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:84%
who had passed over when
she was a young girl.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very true story.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And hew as a neurosurgeon--
he's a neurosurgeon,

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
so it's very interesting,
from a scientific point

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.264 align:middle line:84%
of view, how things
are certainly changing

00:06:34.264 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and the world of science
is getting very, very close

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.740 align:middle line:90%
to spirit.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:90%
So I had--

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And I can only tell you this
based on my experiences,

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I had-- 10 years ago about,
roughly a little bit more,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.725 align:middle line:90%
probably, I had food poisoning.

00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.325 align:middle line:84%
And I was sick for
about 12 hours.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
I was in the bathroom

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
for the 12th time,
blood everywhere.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my
head hit the counter.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:90%
And I popped out of my body.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking down at my
body, and I'm like [GASPS].

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I won't say the word,
but not spiritual.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.944 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at that body,
and I had the realization,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:90%
number one, that I wasn't dead.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was not my time to go.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It was not my time to go.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just like hovering
there, totally outside of time.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as time.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I was outside of it.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.406 align:middle line:90%
I was looking outside of it.

00:07:22.406 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
But I was like, OK-- I had
the awareness of, OK, then

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.085 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing here?

00:07:26.085 --> 00:07:27.459 align:middle line:84%
Because if this
isn't my-- I know

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:90%
this is not my time to leave.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was so interesting.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, I
had these realities

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that I was connected to,
if you will, a tapestry.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of my head was
this kind of cord, if you will,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:90%
or a ribbon.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that if I would
think good thoughts, loving

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.520 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, positive
thoughts, that ribbon

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:84%
would turn beautiful colors and
bleed into this other tapestry,

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:84%
which I call the
human tapestry, which

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.275 align:middle line:84%
is above everyone,
like a matrix.

00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
also that if I had

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:84%
negative thoughts, fearful
thoughts, dense thoughts,

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
the colors would turn
murky and gray and dark,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and also, then, bled
into that tapestry,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
making it kind of
murky and dense.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, at
the end of my life

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
there would be a
life review, and I

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
would look back at
that tapestry and see

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and be responsible for
what I put into it, how

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:90%
I influenced that tapestry.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Did I make it
beautiful and loving

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and beautiful to look at?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Or was it really ugly and
distasteful and really bad?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.523 align:middle line:84%
What was my part in that human
tapestry that everybody shared?

00:08:30.523 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So then, immediately, I
had a sense of the oneness,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
that we're all connected to
this one tapestry or matrix,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and that what we
think, what we create,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:90%
will influence that tapestry.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And we're all connected.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:90%
We're all one.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that pretty
wild to have that?

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow, that's
pretty incredible.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had
that experience, I know,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.670 align:middle line:84%
because I'm teaching it now,
or reminding people now.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So I remember then
the experience

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.295 align:middle line:84%
was I saw my dead cousin,
Patricia, right in front of me,

00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
her face, had never
seen her in 35 years.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
She was the one who taught me
metaphysics when I was a kid.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was way before people
knew about these things.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And she was really into
reincarnation, metaphysics,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and I was fascinated.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.202 align:middle line:84%
She had completed suicide, and
I never saw her since then.

00:09:19.202 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm driving home on
the train from her--

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:90%
We went to her funeral.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.630 align:middle line:90%
I was a young kid, 10, 11.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And I remember her
sister said to me,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
do you want to pick
anything from hers

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:90%
of her library, any books?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.417 align:middle line:90%
I want that book.

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was Ruth Montgomery's
book called A World Beyond.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.517 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure of any
of you know that book.

00:09:40.517 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a great book,
the very first book

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.016 align:middle line:90%
I read of metaphysics.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.865 align:middle line:90%
You read it.

00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm on the train
going down to New York

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:90%
City from Upstate New York.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.329 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going through these
pages, and on page 45 it said,

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I want this read at my funeral.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:90%
It was her book.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that wild?

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when those
things happen,

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
coincidence, meant to
be, no accidents, divine.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that
was pretty weird.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So that was like,
we're so connected.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So the next person I saw in
that out of body experience

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.342 align:middle line:84%
was my cousin for
the first time.

00:10:11.342 --> 00:10:13.675 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at me, and I
saw her beautiful blue eyes.

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:14.932 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.932 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I knew her from
the inside out.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to her,
not even telepathically,

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:90%
just I know her.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:90%
She knows me.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her,
what's going on?

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.714 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I need to-- She
goes, don't worry.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be OK.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be all over.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be all over.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.551 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you never lose
your sense of humor, so I said,

00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:90%
do you mean over over, or over?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Because I need to know.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I have a really
bad time right now.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure where I am here.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And she left.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw this figure
in the garden bent down.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.295 align:middle line:90%
It was a man in a suit.

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I went closer,
and it was my father.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:90%
He was 27 years old.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
He handed me a flower, and he
said, it's not your time yet.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Go back.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And I came back into the body,
and that was my experience.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that--
and I say it very,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.386 align:middle line:90%
very often that-- dying is easy.

00:10:59.386 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Living is hard.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So based upon
that, today I would

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
like to help you to
leave your bodies.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.464 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] What?

00:11:11.464 --> 00:11:12.901 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go.

00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So that was a near
death experience.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are other ways that
you can leave your body, still

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.583 align:middle line:84%
being in control of the
body, but your mind,

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness
will leave the body.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's called an out
of body experience.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's the Monroe
Institute, very, very

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
famous for teaching people
how to leave the body

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and going to a certain
area, or a target location.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It's called remote
viewing as well.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.899 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have heard
about remote viewing, yes?

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And our government
facilitated, in the '70s--

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:90%
they used that, '60s and '70s.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
Russians also used it

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:84%
for spying activities-- very,
very successful, I might add.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I think-- can't say
officially-- that they're still

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:90%
using aspects of remote viewing.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's just placing your
awareness, your space,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
to a place and
going to the target.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So before you came here today--
and for you people at home,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
you also can do
this as well, if you

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.705 align:middle line:90%
get a piece of paper and pencil.

00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll wait.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:90%
So I placed a target.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Now the target is a spoon.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I went to the cafeteria,
and I took a spoon.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.104 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.104 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And I took that spoon.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.325 align:middle line:90%
That's the target, the spoon.

00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a metal spoon,
a regular soup spoon.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.115 align:middle line:90%
And I put that spoon in a place.

00:12:22.115 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.719 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I'm
going to tell you is-- I'm

00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:90%
not going to tell you anything.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.879 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you
that I put that spoon

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in an area, a
location, and I really

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
want you to tune
in to where it is.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
guide you in this.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And what I want you
to do is I want you,

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
with that piece
of paper and pen,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
just to either-- you're gonna
write down something that comes

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.576 align:middle line:84%
into your mind, or you're
going to take yourself

00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to go-- and I'll

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:90%
help you in a second to do this.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.371 align:middle line:84%
You're actually going
to go out of the body

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:84%
to that silver spoon, bring your
consciousness to that spoon,

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and be mindful of any
movement around it,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
any shapes around it,
any activity around it,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
anything you pick up from
when you leave the body,

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:90%
your conscious will leave.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that's
how spirits communicate,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.340 align:middle line:84%
because they come
close to us, remember.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm picking up in my mind.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It's a mind to
mind communication.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to take
your mind out of that body

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and just go to the target,
which is that silver spoon.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Is that good?

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.897 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.897 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.721 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I expect you all
to do really well.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to guide you
a little bit on how to do this,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So just close your
eyes for a second.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Just close your eyes.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.145 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
you to be mindful.

00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of the
sound of my voice,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and just be mindful of
your feet on the floor.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Place all of the
awareness on your feet,

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:84%
because if you become
too much in the head,

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.970 align:middle line:90%
you won't integrate the energy.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So bring the energy
down to your feet.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And also imagine that
you, as a spiritual being,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.892 align:middle line:90%
go way beyond your feet.

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The feet go straight
down to Mother Earth

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.124 align:middle line:90%
like roots of a tree.

00:13:56.124 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And they are part
of Mother Earth,

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
limited to the body.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And be mindful also that you
are a divine spark of God.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
You are this light, and that
light permeates everything.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So that light, you are
part of the heavens.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The beam of light,
you are connected

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.380 align:middle line:84%
to that light, which is in
the heaven worlds around us.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So you bring in that beautiful
sense of loving light.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And place that, bring that
lovingly, heavenly light

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.599 align:middle line:84%
and the earth light, the earth
energy, up to your heart.

00:14:28.599 --> 00:14:30.015 align:middle line:84%
The heart is the
seat of the soul.

00:14:30.015 --> 00:14:31.510 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And just for a second,
remind yourself

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
with gratitude about who you
are, that you are a soul,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
and you have chosen this
particular time in history,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
in human history, to come back
here to experience human life,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reasons your
particular soul chose.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Just get to that heart space.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
The soul is tucked
nicely behind the heart.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And just give yourself a bit
of gratitude for being here.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy
school to come back to.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Just be with that for
a moment, and just sit

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:90%
in that space for a moment.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.235 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.235 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath,
and then exhale.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And let it go.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Now do that two more times.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And inhale, and exhale.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Good come back into
your heart space.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And just one more time,
and inhale and exhale.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Great, into the heart space.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And as you notice
now, you become

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:84%
mindful that you are in
that space of your heart.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:84%
You feel much more connected
with your true self,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.316 align:middle line:90%
the true essence of your being.

00:15:44.316 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I would like for you to
place your mind and a vision,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:84%
imagination, whatever you want
to use, on that silver spoon.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:90%
It's outside the studio.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.417 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
say that to you.

00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:90%
It's outside the studio.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you
to envision, let

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
your mind take you and travel
to its location, the target

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:84%
location, and just see what
you can see and envision.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And write down whatever
you see, whatever you feel.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:90%
It could be words.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:90%
It could be shapes.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.196 align:middle line:84%
You could draw a picture,
whatever comes to you.

00:16:16.196 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And just think-- feel it.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.707 align:middle line:90%
Feel with the silver spoon.

00:16:18.707 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the textures, is there
movement, shapes, feelings.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So just take your mind and go.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Don't think about it, because
then you get in your way.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.076 align:middle line:90%
Let your soul travel.

00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Let your soul just
take you to anything

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:90%
you get with that silver spoon.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Here it comes in.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
are going there.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:90%
OK, you ready?

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.661 align:middle line:90%
We're going to finish up.

00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:49.749 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:50.790 align:middle line:90%
What did you get, lovely?

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you
explain that to us?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.628 align:middle line:84%
Because God knows I don't
know what that means.

00:16:59.628 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I saw eggs and
like a kitchen and a gal

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.146 align:middle line:84%
with a ponytail with an
apron on, and maybe grates.

00:17:10.146 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.366 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Straight lines.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, very good.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Anybody back there?

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I pictured it
outside in a silver SUV

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:90%
on a black seat.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.599 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're a weirdo.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.424 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.424 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Anybody over here?

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear from you, sir.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
What did you see?

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.652 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:17:31.652 --> 00:17:33.277 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I was
outside with it also.

00:17:33.277 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's some trees, and
kind of like a bench thing.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's some meditation
type stuff around it too.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.267 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like
there's a figure there.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.715 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Shapes?

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Is there a shape?

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's a
meditation-- like a rock type

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.559 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a statue--
a little small statue.

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very interesting.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I got under
one of those picnic

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
tables, the benches, and it was
close to the earth on cement.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.062 align:middle line:84%
And I saw blue skies,
clouds, and the grass.

00:18:11.062 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.949 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.949 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Any of you guys?

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.102 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.102 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:90%
What did you get?

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:90%
You had to go somewhere?

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:90%
You went, so--

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: In a closet, inside
a lapel jacket, or a jacket.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I had it
there before I placed it.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Did you really?

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my god.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
I saw it there.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I had it
there before I placed it.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.331 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.258 align:middle line:84%
So where it was was--
and you were the closest.

00:18:32.258 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So right now, if you
looked at that spoon,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it will be facing up
to the sky, looking up.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
It's underneath a tree
and next to some--

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in a little meditation
area with stones on it.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are like
bushes all around it.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.479 align:middle line:84%
And the picnic table
isn't too far away.

00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's next to a
building with old stone.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.609 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:90%
So you did really, really well.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.274 align:middle line:84%
So some of you
got the structure.

00:18:54.274 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of you got a
feeling of stone.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.595 align:middle line:84%
Somebody got the
light of the sky.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.774 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.774 --> 00:19:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
if you just go with it.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:90%
I like that you left.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.576 align:middle line:90%
You left.

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:90%
You went there.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.307 align:middle line:84%
Your mind kind of
went, and I love that.

00:19:05.307 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And the more one can do that,
the more practice you get,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:90%
the better you'll get at it.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.584 align:middle line:84%
So if I put that spoon
next to water, one of you

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
might have picked
up the movement.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.125 align:middle line:84%
And you say, there's movement
going back and forth,

00:19:15.125 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and that would have
been the water moving.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.044 align:middle line:90%
So that happens, too.

00:19:18.044 --> 00:19:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you get a cold
breeze, a hot breeze,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:90%
and it all means something.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So the more you can
fine tune into that,

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
you can do it, because
you travel all the time.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, is that good?

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.324 align:middle line:84%
So try it at home,
too, and good luck.

00:19:30.324 --> 00:19:31.240 align:middle line:90%
I hope all of you did.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
If you did get it at home,
write to me on my Facebook page

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:90%
and tell me, would you please?

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.926 align:middle line:84%
What I like to do is I
like to open up my mind

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and bring spirit
through for you.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And if that's-- if
I can communicate,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to bring through
several people here.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And if the information
makes sense to you

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.757 align:middle line:84%
please raise your hand
and acknowledge it, OK?

00:19:49.757 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:90%
So I have a couple people.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.981 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady here, and
I feel like I'm a sister,

00:19:52.981 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going
to stay with that.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
But I feel a lady in my 70s.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I was in a
hospital or I was in a bed

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:90%
before I passed over.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.607 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure I was either
in a hospital or right before.

00:20:02.607 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would it
be a sister of yours?

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My grandmother.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your grandmother?

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.698 align:middle line:84%
Well, just let me get a
little further, please.

00:20:08.698 --> 00:20:10.685 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure, but I
feel like I'm in my 70s

00:20:10.685 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
when I passed over.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm either in a bed,
and I know that I'm

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:90%
being visited by you beforehand.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I'm a
sister-in-law or a sister,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
but I almost feel like
I'm in the same line here.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that there must
have been some temperature

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.951 align:middle line:84%
problems, a fever
going up and down.

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
they tried giving me

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:84%
some antibiotics at
one time as well.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that I also needed
help with oxygen breathing,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
breathe too well.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just know that's
very, very true.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm also very aware that I used
to like to wear house dresses

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:84%
or house coats, this
sort of a thing.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very
aware that I used

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
to like to keep coupons or
have coupons for the store

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and cut the coupons out,
and I'm aware of that.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense to you?

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.133 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: May I come to you?

00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:51.387 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.387 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
What is your name, please?

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Patty.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Patty.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, Patty.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.489 align:middle line:84%
So Patty, so this lady--
go on, mm hm-- would she

00:20:58.489 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
be on your mother's side of the
family, your mother's mother,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
is it, please?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.238 align:middle line:84%
Because she talks
about your mother very,

00:21:04.238 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:90%
very strongly here, too.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.625 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking
about jewelery,

00:21:06.625 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:84%
so I've got to put that
aside about jewelery,

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.404 align:middle line:90%
all of her jewelery.

00:21:09.404 --> 00:21:11.319 align:middle line:84%
And she's mentioning
that to me to give to you

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:12.810 align:middle line:90%
so you understand that it's her.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I
had that house coat,

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put my
hands into pockets here.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.732 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you, do you
understand the information

00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
about either being in a hospital
or being in a hospital bed

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.680 align:middle line:84%
before she passes over,
or she passes in that bed?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Does that make sense
to you, darling?

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.159 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:31.244 align:middle line:84%
And would you know about
people saying prayers

00:21:31.244 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:90%
at the time of her passing--

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --or right
before the passing?

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be very,
very aware then,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.263 align:middle line:84%
also-- I've just got to repeat
my information that I receive--

00:21:38.263 --> 00:21:40.709 align:middle line:84%
about whether there would be
fevers or temperatures going

00:21:40.709 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:90%
up and down at one point?

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you would remember,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
as she comes close to me,
gives me a memory of someone

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
dabbling her forehead
with a cloth.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Would that-- you
would have done that?

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.763 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:21:52.763 --> 00:21:53.734 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.734 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:90%
So you would have done that.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.527 align:middle line:84%
And she's just remembering
this, as she comes closer

00:21:57.527 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
into this atmosphere,
into your space,

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.800 align:middle line:84%
she's remembering
that you did that.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.564 align:middle line:84%
She was a-- This is
your grandmother then?

00:22:03.564 --> 00:22:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
you took good care of her.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.053 align:middle line:84%
I know when other
people in the family

00:22:08.053 --> 00:22:10.380 align:middle line:84%
would not take care of
her, you stepped in.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to
thank you for that.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.195 align:middle line:90%
Is her dad with her?

00:22:15.195 --> 00:22:15.861 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:15.861 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Her dad's
over there, has to be.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He's too old to be
here, I'd think.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a brother
as well, she said.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.330 align:middle line:84%
She says my brother's
finally here.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I know there's another
sister over there as well.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.496 align:middle line:84%
And she's now talking
about my whole family.

00:22:28.496 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, but I still
have some things down there

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:90%
on the earth.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there was
a problem with her family

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.119 align:middle line:90%
after she passed away.

00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know whether
it was an argument,

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:84%
or whether there was some
separation, some disagreement

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:84%
with some of her belongings,
do you understand that, please?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.219 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And she's just
acknowledging that.

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.242 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about you
really cared about my things.

00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that you
care about dignity.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I know that you-- She
comes beautifully perfumed.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:54.422 align:middle line:90%
She has perfume on.

00:22:54.422 --> 00:22:56.213 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to say
something about either

00:22:56.213 --> 00:22:58.865 align:middle line:84%
you have her perfume, you have
an old bottle of her perfume,

00:22:58.865 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:90%
don't you?

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So she's talking
about you having that.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And she said, as you smell
that, that's me there.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.845 align:middle line:84%
And you know you've
smelt it, don't you?

00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.756 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm
going to tell you,

00:23:11.756 --> 00:23:14.785 align:middle line:84%
within the past week, you smelt
that perfume in your house.

00:23:14.785 --> 00:23:15.945 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:23:15.945 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.575 align:middle line:84%
So it's just acknowledgement and
validation that she's with you

00:23:19.575 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and that she's--- that's her.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that I like--
OK, thank you.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Got you.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.776 align:middle line:84%
She said, I haven't
gone anywhere, darling.

00:23:26.776 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
I haven't gone
anywhere, darling.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I still like to watch--
sit and TV with you.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:84%
I still watch my favorite
television shows with you.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still watching
you watching shows.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I know that you love to do those
crossword puzzles and watch TV,

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:84%
or you have a newspaper
there with the TV on.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.794 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:23:41.794 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She said she was
with you in the living room

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
or TV room, and you
were sitting there

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and you either had a
periodical or a newspaper

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
on your lap while you're
watching a television show.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.381 align:middle line:84%
She's just giving
me that in my mind.

00:23:53.381 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me
that in my mind.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.199 align:middle line:84%
Now why do you like to watch
these crime shows, or you like

00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:00.115 align:middle line:84%
to watch the crime shows,
you understand that?

00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:01.864 align:middle line:84%
But you said, as I'm
with her, she goes, I

00:24:01.864 --> 00:24:04.484 align:middle line:84%
don't understand why
she watches that stuff.

00:24:04.484 --> 00:24:06.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why
she watches that stuff.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And she's saying that to me.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:84%
It's all this nitty
gritty crime, dirty.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.692 align:middle line:90%
You know, get some stuff going.

00:24:12.692 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to tell you that.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And she's just
laughing about that.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.950 align:middle line:84%
She said, they
told me over here I

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
had to come through with
something you understood,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:19.416 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that
she wants to talk

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.640 align:middle line:84%
about a cuckoo clock,
a grandfather clock.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:90%
You understand, please?

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Do you own that clock?

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Would you understand
about having the clock?

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.782 align:middle line:90%
And I know that it doesn't work.

00:24:31.782 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm very aware it
doesn't work, because I

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.820 align:middle line:90%
know the hands are stuck.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So if I go to there, I
know the hands are stuck.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.111 align:middle line:84%
I would know that one'd be
the longhand looks like it's

00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:84%
going to 10, and whether
it's a four or a three,

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:90%
it's down this way.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.599 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
a sister that she has,

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:90%
and she must have had a sister.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I know there's problems
there with her sister,

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.237 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think they
talked for a while.

00:24:51.237 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But she's met her
in the spirit world,

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and she's forgiven everything.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.335 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She has her
animals with her as well.

00:24:56.335 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I know she has a
little doggie with her.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:90%
But she has a doggie.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
You understand, darling?

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.976 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that
doggie was her life.

00:25:03.976 --> 00:25:04.872 align:middle line:90%
It was her life.

00:25:04.872 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:90%
It really was her life.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know in her
lifetime, she had

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
brought through many, many-- she
had been through an experience

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:84%
where she lost some people
in a war or in the military,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:90%
and she got to meet them again.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.257 align:middle line:90%
I need to let you know that.

00:25:18.257 --> 00:25:19.215 align:middle line:90%
I need to let you know.

00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I think there were two
men, two men, not one, two,

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that she had lost in a war
or in a military situation.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.054 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:25:26.054 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
One more thing, then
I've got to move on here,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.803 align:middle line:84%
because I have another
gentleman pushing in.

00:25:29.803 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I am very aware either of a
board games or board game.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my gosh.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you
used to play the board

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:90%
game with me, board games.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure if it was Monopoly.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It was, great.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And she wants to thank you.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.791 align:middle line:84%
She said she cheated
every once in a while.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:90%
She just said that in my head.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.320 align:middle line:84%
She cheated every
once in a while.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So she wants me
to tell you that.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.557 align:middle line:90%
And she comes in love.

00:25:51.557 --> 00:25:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And she's talking about your
mama, your mama, your mama,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.400 align:middle line:90%
your mama.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.941 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:54.941 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I just think your mama has
strange views, she said.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
says your mother

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:90%
has some very strange views.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
This lady doesn't care what
people think, you know.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.600 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't care what
people think of her.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.890 align:middle line:90%
The heck with them, she says.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know she was
raised in a farming area.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
There was a farm in the Midwest
and she has a farm as a girl.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:90%
She's telling me that.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:90%
And I know that.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.323 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
she, in some ways,

00:26:13.323 --> 00:26:15.156 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you're more
of a daughter to her

00:26:15.156 --> 00:26:16.197 align:middle line:90%
than her own daughter is.

00:26:16.197 --> 00:26:16.934 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:16.934 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now if I
can say one more thing,

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to move
onto this gentleman.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I have Rebecca's Farm.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Rebecca.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:23.966 align:middle line:90%
Rebecca's Farm.

00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.465 align:middle line:84%
There was, I don't
know, Rebecca's Farm

00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:29.362 align:middle line:84%
was either a book or
something, Rebecca's Farm,

00:26:29.362 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Remember
that, the title?

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why she's
referring to this,

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
but I want to refer
to Rebecca's Farm.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.275 align:middle line:84%
Would you look
and see if there's

00:26:37.275 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:84%
a book with that name on
it, or see what that means,

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:84%
because she's just
bringing that to my mind.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I know
what it means.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.295 align:middle line:90%
She used to read it to me.

00:26:43.295 --> 00:26:44.305 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She used
to read it to you.

00:26:44.305 --> 00:26:45.002 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:45.002 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
I'll leave with that.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.260 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.416 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:55.766 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:55.766 --> 00:26:57.182 align:middle line:84%
I have a gentleman
here who comes,

00:26:57.182 --> 00:26:59.682 align:middle line:84%
and he's a father figure who
comes to me very, very clearly.

00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Have you lost a father?

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right
over here, your dad?

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're not
related, are you?

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.176 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:07.176 --> 00:27:09.716 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: See, I have a man
here, so he's right with her,

00:27:09.716 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was with you,
because he comes over here.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So I need to go-- come--
Isn't it interesting?

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.880 align:middle line:84%
One right after
to the other one.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.545 align:middle line:90%
Love that.

00:27:16.545 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
This grandmother's very
open to staying, you see.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.800 align:middle line:84%
She would have been
into this stuff.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.674 align:middle line:84%
Your grandmother would
have loved this stuff.

00:27:23.674 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:90%
She's so happy you're here.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.740 align:middle line:84%
She's saying, bring
champagne toast.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
She brings me a champagne glass.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Toast, toast, toast.

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.176 align:middle line:84%
I know February birthday,
also mentioning.

00:27:33.176 --> 00:27:34.092 align:middle line:90%
So let me come to you.

00:27:34.092 --> 00:27:34.841 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:27:34.841 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Anne.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Anne,
do you remember

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.468 align:middle line:84%
when he used to open up the
map and show you the map?

00:27:38.468 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I'm going
to talk about a memory

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
that he comes
through with for me.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.194 align:middle line:84%
Is I'm either in a
Chevy car, an old Chevy

00:27:45.194 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:90%
that he used to drive.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It was an old car.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And he used to open
up his old maps

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.605 align:middle line:84%
that he would get at
the filling station.

00:27:51.605 --> 00:27:52.869 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:54.035 align:middle line:90%
He's saying filling station.

00:27:54.035 --> 00:27:58.056 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard that expression
in years, the filling station,

00:27:58.056 --> 00:27:58.555 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:27:58.555 --> 00:28:01.154 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying, they gave
us a map when we filled up.

00:28:01.154 --> 00:28:02.695 align:middle line:84%
They gave us a map
when we filled it.

00:28:02.695 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Would you remember
either Sunday afternoon

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.514 align:middle line:84%
drives, or just going in
that car with your dad.

00:28:08.514 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With the drives?

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:12.868 align:middle line:84%
And would you remember that,
unfolding the map or something

00:28:12.868 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:90%
like this, right?

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I know that I love this guy.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:90%
I love him.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:90%
I just love his energy.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I love his energy.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.084 align:middle line:90%
I love his handwriting.

00:28:22.084 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I've got to tell you, he
has very neat and beautiful

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:24.820 align:middle line:90%
handwriting.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know that, if you
look at his handwriting,

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I know you must
have books that he

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.104 align:middle line:84%
had with his signature
in the front of it.

00:28:31.104 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
You understand
that, please, Anne?

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Good.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
if I look at that,

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.422 align:middle line:84%
I see these big loopy letters,
and very artistically done.

00:28:38.422 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm very aware
that there could

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
have been a middle
initial with him,

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and that he would
not write his name

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:84%
without that middle initial
being point-- sorry, part

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:84%
of it, because his whole name--
And I can't get necessarily

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.420 align:middle line:84%
the full name, the
middle name, but I

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.774 align:middle line:90%
know it's an initial there.

00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.898 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I
feel, in some ways,

00:28:57.898 --> 00:28:59.350 align:middle line:90%
a bit conservative to this man.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I grew up in a,
I'm not going to say staunch,

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:84%
but there's an establishment
he grows up in.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.044 align:middle line:90%
I feel he's a self-made person.

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.168 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I think everybody

00:29:08.168 --> 00:29:09.510 align:middle line:90%
should be very proud of him.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:11.970 align:middle line:84%
He works his hands to the
bones when he's younger.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I know that he works, aged
12 that he starts working.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Age 12 he has to go out there
and do hard, difficult things.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very
aware at one point,

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:84%
around 18 years of
age, 19 years of age,

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I know mechanical
things, he's got

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to go in to fix cars or
fix the underneath of cars,

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:27.190 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
he's showing me.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.546 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who used to
deliver things to places?

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.657 align:middle line:84%
Did he have to deliver
things at one point, please?

00:29:33.657 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He was a newspaper--

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A newspaper
man, delivered newspapers.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Threw
newspapers as a boy.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, great.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:90%
I know that was very hard.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.920 align:middle line:90%
I like horses, by the way, too.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So I like farming
or horses around

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:90%
or pastures around there.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:45.510 align:middle line:90%
And I like that with this man.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I would ask you if you thought
about keeping a hat of his,

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and don't you have it?

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's
one in my house, yes.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much,

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
because he wants
you to acknowledge

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.720 align:middle line:90%
the hat that you have of his.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.676 align:middle line:90%
Where is your mother?

00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's
in North Texas.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What's
going on with your mother?

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you not speak with her?

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We are estranged.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.178 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:30:01.178 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So I know that the reason
why he's here tonight

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:84%
is for you to make
amends with your mom.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you happy you came today?

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And I knew you were
going to say that.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You knew
I was going to say that,

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because it's a real
important thing.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.325 align:middle line:90%
Your father loves you so much--

00:30:19.325 --> 00:30:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I know.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --that he's come
all this way from the spirit

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.120 align:middle line:84%
realm to tell you the most
important thing for your soul

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:90%
is to forgive your mother.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, she's a big mouth.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:90%
She's a loud mouth, he says.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.270 align:middle line:84%
He says she has no
sense of caution.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.004 align:middle line:84%
She has no sense of
holding things back.

00:30:33.004 --> 00:30:34.295 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't respect boundaries.

00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
She just speaks it,
but that's who she is.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I know that.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.353 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's who she is.

00:30:39.353 --> 00:30:42.220 align:middle line:84%
We've got to love her, warts and
all, because nobody's perfect,

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.850 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.080 align:middle line:90%
We all have a history.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:90%
We all have that back history.

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you can find
it in your heart

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.580 align:middle line:84%
to forgive her for the
little that she knows,

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
she's probably not
even aware of that.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So as I say before--
I say in every show,

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
practically-- take the
high road, less traffic.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
forgive someone else,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:84%
you would love if they could
forgive you, so do that.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.486 align:middle line:84%
It's causing problems
in your stomach.

00:31:04.486 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It's causing these
little indigestions.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got some indigestion
things going on,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:90%
your dad's saying.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what that
is, but it's emotional.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.400 align:middle line:90%
It's emotional stuff.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.185 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
split up the family.

00:31:14.185 --> 00:31:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, it has.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Didn't she live
with your sister for a while?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Um,
I have a brother.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.492 align:middle line:84%
My brother lived with
her for a while, yes.

00:31:20.492 --> 00:31:22.783 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And does she
not get along with his wife,

00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:24.270 align:middle line:84%
or there's little
problems there?

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, there's
big problems there.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah,
I know there is,

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's your
sister-- I'm sorry.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.183 align:middle line:90%
He corrected me.

00:31:29.183 --> 00:31:29.715 align:middle line:90%
It's the sister-in-law.

00:31:29.715 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's problems
with the sister-in-law and her,

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
she's living at the
sister-in-law's house,

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and there's problems there.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.285 align:middle line:84%
Who did the cartoons,
cartoon drawing?

00:31:37.285 --> 00:31:39.785 align:middle line:84%
When your dad was younger, did
he ever fool around with just

00:31:39.785 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:84%
for the heck with
these sketches?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes,
he loved to sketch.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that some of his sketches,

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.270 align:middle line:90%
he tells me, still exist.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think your mother
might have some.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm sure she does.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know there's an attic,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.696 align:middle line:84%
or there's a garage
or something where

00:31:49.696 --> 00:31:50.904 align:middle line:90%
she has some of those things.

00:31:50.904 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And send her a card and
say, I'm very sorry.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Please forgive me.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.130 align:middle line:90%
I love you for who you are.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to say.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.394 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS].

00:31:58.394 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
it's hard, honey.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.520 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to come back
and do it all over again now,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.220 align:middle line:90%
do you?

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:90%


00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.610 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you with that.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:06.900 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.844 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: All
right, thank you.

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:09.052 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You're welcome.

00:32:09.052 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk
about somebody who

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:84%
knows about a little
girl, young girl.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.281 align:middle line:84%
I would say she's probably in
her late teens to early 20s,

00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not sure if she's
directly affected here

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.562 align:middle line:84%
in the room or that
you would know of her.

00:32:24.562 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I need to ask somebody
if they know someone

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that past quickly,
unexpectedly, in the spirit

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.220 align:middle line:90%
world who was very young.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I lost my daughter.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You lost
your daughter, OK.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And was she in her
early 20s or late teens?

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Were they 21?

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 21.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 21, great.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So may I bring her
forth for you, please?

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And would
you mind standing, my love.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.328 align:middle line:84%
Give me a hug first,
because I want

00:32:46.328 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:90%
to give that to you from her.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.495 align:middle line:90%
That's from her to you.

00:32:49.495 --> 00:32:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And I had to do that to you.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:90%
And your name again is?

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Donna.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.353 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Donna.

00:32:53.353 --> 00:32:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Donna, can I just say,
and on behalf of her,

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:84%
because I love
her energy, I just

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.239 align:middle line:84%
want to say on behalf of
you and your daughter,

00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:02.780 align:middle line:84%
she wants to thank everybody in
this audience for being here,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.738 align:middle line:84%
because without you, she
wouldn't have made it,

00:33:04.738 --> 00:33:05.350 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's the energy
that you set up,

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.298 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere you
set up for being here,

00:33:08.298 --> 00:33:09.820 align:middle line:84%
including all the
technical people,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:90%
that she can come here today.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Mom,
you've made a big step,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.710 align:middle line:90%
and thank you for forgiving me.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:15.551 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:17.425 align:middle line:84%
Because for years, you
would not forgive her.

00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:18.966 align:middle line:84%
For a time, you
wouldn't forgive her.

00:33:18.966 --> 00:33:20.170 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Now did you want to bring
a picture with her--

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:84%
you have today, or did you
want to bring that with you?

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Was there a thought about
bringing that with you?

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.535 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you have
a picture of her at all?

00:33:27.535 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In my wallet, yes.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In your wallet.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Where's your wallet now?

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.460 align:middle line:90%
In your bag?

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You have a picture
of her with you.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.155 align:middle line:90%
Just saying.

00:33:36.155 --> 00:33:36.655 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.655 --> 00:33:39.082 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I carry
it all the time, yes.

00:33:39.082 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm just
saying, she's telling me that.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm being very literal here.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:90%
She's being very literal, OK?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Very literal.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So that's
OK, baby, that's OK.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So I know that when the
girl comes close to me,

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.193 align:middle line:84%
I know I didn't make
my 22nd birthday.

00:33:50.193 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I know I didn't.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I know that I passed
around my 21st.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.181 align:middle line:84%
So there's not too much time
passes by afterwards where

00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I go.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.605 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:33:57.605 --> 00:33:58.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Because she's just
giving this to me

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:90%
into my mind to give to you.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that you tried to
make her look very pretty,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.889 align:middle line:84%
made her as pretty as
you possibly could.

00:34:05.889 --> 00:34:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think this must have
been when she was laid

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.135 align:middle line:90%
or, or she was in a coffin.

00:34:09.135 --> 00:34:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that you wanted her hair.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:14.172 align:middle line:84%
I know you wanted the
piece of the hair.

00:34:14.172 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I know that you cut
the piece of the hair

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.504 align:middle line:84%
and that you wanted,
right, sweetheart?

00:34:17.504 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.659 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
That's so beautiful.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:90%
And she honors that.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.219 align:middle line:90%
She honors that.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my mom
made me look so pretty.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about the angels.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk
about an angel pin,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.185 align:middle line:84%
or somebody put an angel
pin near that coffin.

00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:30.781 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.781 --> 00:34:32.530 align:middle line:84%
I also want to talk
about pictures of her,

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.607 align:middle line:90%
photographs around there.

00:34:33.607 --> 00:34:34.440 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I understand
about writing a letter.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.166 align:middle line:84%
I understand you're
putting it in there.

00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:39.129 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.129 --> 00:34:39.754 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:34:39.754 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that she

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
said she didn't feel anything,
and things happened very, very

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I know there was a grandparent
over there for her.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you that
she will finish school.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:51.940 align:middle line:90%
She loves animals.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:84%
She loves kids, and she's
going to work on that, OK?

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you if you
have an earring of hers?

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Why is she talking about
earrings or earring?

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Did she ever have an
earring in her nose

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:84%
or one of those things,
or a belly button?

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's one of
those sorts of things.

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's
like an earring,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.391 align:middle line:90%
but it's not in the ears.

00:35:12.391 --> 00:35:13.314 align:middle line:90%
So it's a belly ring.

00:35:13.314 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you had that?

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.085 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:15.085 --> 00:35:16.418 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's what it is.

00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.171 align:middle line:84%
You never know the
weirdest things you get,

00:35:19.171 --> 00:35:20.430 align:middle line:90%
but that's great proof.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that she's telling
me her clothes didn't fit her.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I know that she had a very
bad self-image of herself

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.600 align:middle line:90%
at one point, you know that.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
look beautiful now.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
she's telling me,

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.130 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't even look
at herself in the mirror,

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:84%
or she had a hard
time with that.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:34.890 align:middle line:90%
She's in a good space.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of her
as in a bad space.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of her
as going to hell,

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:90%
because that doesn't exist.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And she's a good person.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.295 align:middle line:90%
She had to go in her own time.

00:35:43.295 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Why did you leave me?

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Why did you leave me?

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.435 align:middle line:90%
Why'd you leave me?

00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:46.518 align:middle line:90%
She can hear you say that.

00:35:46.518 --> 00:35:48.727 align:middle line:84%
You must wake up at
3:30 every morning.

00:35:48.727 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
clock, it's around 3:30,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.647 align:middle line:90%
3:40 every morning.

00:35:51.647 --> 00:35:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Because she goes, I come to
visit her at 3:30 to 3:40

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:90%
every morning.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.690 align:middle line:84%
She looks at the clock,
and it's on the left side.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I look over, and
there's my clock.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.044 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:36:02.044 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.168 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That
is because she's

00:36:04.168 --> 00:36:06.330 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the bed
with you, hugging you.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you have t-shirts
of hers, by the way?

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So I know there's
t-shirts there.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I know I have some
brushes of hers.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.836 align:middle line:84%
I know you must have a
brush of mine, don't you?

00:36:18.836 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know you must
have a cosmetic bag.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know you do.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I know you have my cosmetic bag.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.969 align:middle line:84%
I know that cosmetic bag--
my little flowers on it,

00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
graphic with flowers.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know if
I open up that cosmetic bag,

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that I'm very aware there could
be a little brush in there

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:90%
and bigger-- got a comb.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I am very aware of the
eye stuff going on.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.147 align:middle line:84%
Do you have there, mascara
and all that stuff.

00:36:39.147 --> 00:36:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very aware, she
keeps on telling me,

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:84%
two brushes you have of hers,
one bigger, one smaller.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
finding coins around.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.621 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And she said,
it's me dropping the coins.

00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:50.121 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.121 --> 00:36:52.004 align:middle line:84%
So she's dropping those
coins all around you.

00:36:52.004 --> 00:36:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you know it's her.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.734 align:middle line:84%
And you talk to
her all the time.

00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:56.046 align:middle line:90%
You talk to her all the time.

00:36:56.046 --> 00:36:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And where is the crucifix,
the cross that you have?

00:36:58.170 --> 00:36:59.229 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.229 --> 00:37:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
a cross or a neck or--

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.012 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She had a--

00:37:02.012 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A tattoo?

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.595 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband
wore a crucifix.

00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It was hers.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.403 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There we go.

00:37:06.403 --> 00:37:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A
little copper cross.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
this is significant.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And he's still alive, is he?

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
husband, isn't he?

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.045 align:middle line:84%
So could you please let him
know that she sees him wear it?

00:37:18.045 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:90%
He stopped wearing it.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know that it's

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:84%
in his top drawer or the
top drawer of his dresser.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.303 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she
knows that he did that.

00:37:26.303 --> 00:37:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I go
there-- interesting,

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
she watches her father
wear socks at night,

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:90%
like his sweats and his socks.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, he does
wear socks at night a lot.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
one more thing I'm

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:39.966 align:middle line:84%
going to let you know that
she did not die in vain.

00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:41.100 align:middle line:90%
She did not die in vain.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I know that.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And you said that.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.811 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say thank you
for the-- yeah, all right.

00:37:44.811 --> 00:37:45.475 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:37:45.475 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.325 align:middle line:90%
She's not dead.

00:37:47.325 --> 00:37:47.950 align:middle line:90%
She's not dead.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:48.575 align:middle line:90%
She's not dead.

00:37:48.575 --> 00:37:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know the garden,
the back, or something

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.220 align:middle line:84%
in the back you have
going on for her.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:90%
And she loves that.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.036 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want you to
be obsessed with that,

00:37:55.036 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:90%
she said, OK?

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I know the pictures need
to be changed inside the house.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.316 align:middle line:84%
You have some pictures
that are sitting there.

00:38:00.316 --> 00:38:01.547 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's on the shelf.

00:38:01.547 --> 00:38:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I know in the kitchen you
make her favorite meals still.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:84%
You still do that in her
honor, and you sit there

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:90%
at the table talking to her.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And you just did it
recently, didn't you?

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.674 align:middle line:90%
Was it Thursday or something?

00:38:11.674 --> 00:38:13.715 align:middle line:84%
You just made a meal for
her, Thursday or Sunday.

00:38:13.715 --> 00:38:14.587 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.587 --> 00:38:15.170 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I can't
even remember.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
think about that.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.490 align:middle line:90%
I like pasta.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm liking pasta.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.757 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, we had
shrimp scampi, yes.

00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hello.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.011 align:middle line:90%


00:38:24.011 --> 00:38:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So she wants me to tell
you she's right with you

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing that.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And now this is something
very interesting to know.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.620 align:middle line:84%
The spirit can get the essence
of your eating something.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And they can feel the essence
of what you're eating,

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the flavors, whether
it's drinking,

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.650 align:middle line:90%
or the flavors of food.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.704 align:middle line:84%
They can get the essence
one more time of that.

00:38:39.704 --> 00:38:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said thank you for
making that in the honor.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said I'm bringing
roses to you when I see you.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.315 align:middle line:90%
And the dream we had with roses.

00:38:47.315 --> 00:38:50.280 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I smell things.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:90%
I know it's her.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
her with the roses.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.838 align:middle line:84%
She's saying it's the
rose significantly.

00:38:54.838 --> 00:38:56.339 align:middle line:90%
So her love continues.

00:38:56.339 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave you with that.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my love.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:38:58.445 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:58.445 --> 00:38:59.611 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: God bless you.

00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.925 align:middle line:90%


00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very, very much.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.393 align:middle line:84%
That was a great demonstration
of the love of the spirit

00:39:10.393 --> 00:39:12.940 align:middle line:84%
world, how we know we're not
limited to this physical body.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can be with
them in your dreams.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.710 align:middle line:84%
If you meditated and
started going into center,

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you could learn to just
connect with them even further.

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.552 align:middle line:90%
I hope you will do that.

00:39:21.552 --> 00:39:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Go to my website.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
programs that I created,

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.470 align:middle line:90%
meditations to help you do that.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.011 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
a great audience.

00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And thank you everybody
at home who are watching.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And until we meet next time, my
love and light to all of you.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:36.180 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:48.834 align:middle line:90%
