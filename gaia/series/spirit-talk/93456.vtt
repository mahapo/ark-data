00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:32.633 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:33.133 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.578 align:middle line:90%
Hi, thank you.

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:35.078 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:36.056 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Thanks you very much.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much, appreciate it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And thank you at home, also, for
watching "Spirit Talk," where

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I take you one step
closer to heaven.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And today you might notice
that our set has gone.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.619 align:middle line:84%
And, in turn, we've
created these-- well,

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:90%
we have two boxes on the floor.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.347 align:middle line:84%
And God only knows
what's going to happen.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:57.180 align:middle line:84%
The spirit world wanted
me to share with you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:90%
a very special type of species.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.175 align:middle line:84%
They wanted me to work today
with the animal kingdom.

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
How many people out there,
how many people in here,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:90%
have animals?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.414 align:middle line:90%
Practically all of us.

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Animals to me-- and
ever since I started

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
doing this work
over 30 years ago,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that the animal
kingdom is very, very special.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think that
maybe the animal kingdom is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:84%
a separate species or a separate
kingdom from the humans.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And over the years,
spirit would say to me,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:90%
why would you limit spirit?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
We can be part of
the animals as well.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So part of our energy is in
the animals and vice versa.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Everything is one.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no lineation,
if you will.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in their mindset
they're a little different.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I often think that animals
are way beyond the humans.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I think they're pretty evolved.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think they know
about unconditional love.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're incredible healers
about unconditional love.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think we could learn
a lot from our animals

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.480 align:middle line:84%
about unconditional love,
about patience, about humility,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:90%
about compassion.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you hit a dog.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They come back, and
they lick your face.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.155 align:middle line:90%
I wish humans would do that.

00:01:58.155 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe not
licking the face,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
but I wish they would
come back and do that.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So, recently--
well, we know this,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
but we recently we found out
in scientific communities

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
that animals are
really, really important

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
for the healing
aspects of humans.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Animals are now used, of
course, in hospitals and really

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:90%
in centers all over the world.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
This nurse, Rebecca Johnson
from the Integration

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of Humans and Animals Center,
she has found that, of course,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
different types of dogs
are able to detect things

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
before they happen,
like a heart attack.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Certain animals, dogs, can
detect cancers in people.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.870 align:middle line:84%
They can detect,
of course, bombs.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have them for
security reasons.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Animals are so much more aware
on so many levels than we are.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Their sixth sense is
very, very, very refined.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And they'll know things before
they happen all the time.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
There are also animals that are
working now with institutions,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
hospital institutions and
jails and so forth to help.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
To open up, if you will, that
person's sense of connection,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that person's sense of love
and caring, compassion.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:90%
They teach us a lot.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And they could really be
used for institutional work

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:90%
and health work.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
That we find that when we're
around animals-- and even

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.226 align:middle line:84%
the word pet, the word pet
comes from lightly stroking.

00:03:10.226 --> 00:03:11.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what it means,
lightly stroking.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So even if you just
pet a pet, whether it's

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
a cat, a dog, or you can connect
with a fish or your bird.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Just connecting
with them sets off

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:84%
a certain hormone in
the body, oxytocin.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And that really--
that oxytocin hormone

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
releases happiness.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:90%
It's the joy hormone.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the joy hormone.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So, really, working with
animals, being with animals,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:90%
really, really important.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we, as
the human species here,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
have responsibility
to those animals

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:90%
because they give so much to us.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Can't we give a little
bit back in return?

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Don't you think?

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So I often say spay and neuter
are very, very important.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And really help with
shelters and rescue shelters

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
all over the country,
if you could.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:90%
I work a lot with rescuing dogs.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.725 align:middle line:84%
And I once-- this is a
story which I rarely will--

00:03:57.725 --> 00:03:58.476 align:middle line:90%
I'll start crying.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:90%
But I gotta tell it to you.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It's so real.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
For me, personally, when I was
going through an experience,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I was down in San
Diego, California.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.297 align:middle line:84%
And I went to go see a
friend do a show there.

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:09.838 align:middle line:84%
And it was early in the morning,
at 9 o'clock in the morning,

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted Starbucks
because I love my Starbucks.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was at a four-way
stop, downtown San Diego.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:84%
And as if a movie was playing
out two seconds before it

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
happened, I could see
as I'm at the stop sign,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.974 align:middle line:84%
a little girl on the
left was holding a puppy.

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And she was with her mother.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And I saw this happen
right before it did.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:90%
The puppy got out of her arms.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.746 align:middle line:84%
Ran right into the
middle of the street.

00:04:30.746 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I saw this Volvo come up,
and then roll over the dog.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And I freaked.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I freaked out.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:90%
I was like, ah!

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:90%
I had never seen that before.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And I got out of my
car as if in a trance,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and I went down
to that poor dog.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And as if I wanted
to turn back time.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.315 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to turn back time.

00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:49.023 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make sure
this didn't happen.

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I was like, no, no, no, and
this poor dog just writhering

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:90%
in pain there.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.996 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, gosh.

00:04:54.996 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to turn back time.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying
to heal the dog.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.146 align:middle line:84%
I was bringing
everything I could,

00:04:59.146 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:84%
bringing a sense of healing
and love to this animal.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was really painful.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I got
back into my body.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, James, if they
didn't see a little dog down

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.680 align:middle line:84%
here, the cars might
not see you either,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
so you should probably
get up off your rear end

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.447 align:middle line:84%
and get a parking space
and do some-- so I did.

00:05:16.447 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%
I got back up.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what was I thinking?

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.598 align:middle line:84%
But you had to what
you have to do.

00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Your heart tells you.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So I found a parking
space down the street.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I got back
there to the intersection,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
there was a police woman
holding the dog in a blanket.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And the poor little girl
is there, and her mother,

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
who I was not liking.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl was
saying, please, please, please,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say goodbye.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say goodbye.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And it really hurt.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:90%
And it hurt so much.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you think about
that poor little girl,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
how that's going to really,
really take hold of her life,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And that emotional
kick in the heart

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:90%
for that poor little girl.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was so angry
with that mother

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:84%
for not letting that girl have
a leash for that dog downtown.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how would
you not think that?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, that stayed with me.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.058 align:middle line:84%
That experience stayed
with me for a long time,

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:90%
for at least two weeks.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.300 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep at night.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of
scarred by it myself,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
because I was so
obsessed with that.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It hurt so much.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And that one night when I was
able to sleep, I had a dream.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.431 align:middle line:84%
And a guide came to mind who
I'd never recognized before.

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And this guide said
to me, from what

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I can remember, because it's
bits and pieces, fragments.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.631 align:middle line:84%
And the guide said, we're
going to help you now.

00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:90%
We're going to help you.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.629 align:middle line:90%
I said, how is that?

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
You need to go to the
rescue center this weekend.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
There's a dog waiting
there to heal you.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
The dog's waiting to heal me.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.116 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to my
partner, Brian,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.795 align:middle line:84%
and I said, Brian, we have to
go to this-- down to the shelter

00:06:33.795 --> 00:06:34.492 align:middle line:90%
and get a dog.

00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:90%
The dog's waiting to heal me.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, anything
we could do for you

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
to get you back to
normal, we'll do that.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So we went down that Saturday
to this shelter, this rescue

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there and I
looked at all the kennels,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
every single one of
them, all 10 of them.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And I walked by.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And none of the
dogs spoke to me.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:90%
None of these dogs spoke to me.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.101 align:middle line:84%
And the cats spoke to me,
but I'm allergic to cats.

00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But the cats were in the back,
and they were speaking to me.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty good
connecting with animals.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:90%
You'll see in just a bit.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.570 align:middle line:90%
So I remember.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I went back into the lobby.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I sat down, and
I started crying.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, spirit, how
could you do this to me?

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do this to me?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.194 align:middle line:90%
As any human says.

00:07:11.194 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do this to me?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Why would you bring me here?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
I thought there was an
animal here to help heal.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, I look down.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I leaned out.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was a dog that
had been-- was being walked

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.989 align:middle line:84%
and wasn't there
the first go round.

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So I saw this little
white face leaning out

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:90%
the very last kennel.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And I walked down.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:90%
And I got there.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
And she looked up at me.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.348 align:middle line:84%
And then she went
down on her back.

00:07:31.348 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Rolled out and showed me her
belly just like that, just

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.610 align:middle line:90%
like that dog was in the street.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that this was my dog.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I knew that that was my dog.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I knew it right away.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:90%
We felt a connection.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.607 align:middle line:90%
And I took that dog.

00:07:43.607 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And now that's my
proud daughter named

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Maisey May, which
she's a beautiful girl.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.450 align:middle line:84%
She's a dachshund, a white
dachshund Jack Russell.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:90%
So you can imagine.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to my Facebook
page, you'll see her.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I show her there all the time.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I also have a boy rescue
who is a Boston Terrier

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.325 align:middle line:84%
Chihuahua, which looks a little
black Boston Terrier named

00:08:04.325 --> 00:08:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Boo Radley based on "To
Kill a Mockingbird."

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.747 align:middle line:90%
So that's my family.

00:08:08.747 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go get
some more family members, too.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.011 align:middle line:84%
So right now I'm looking to
buy property, lot of acreage,

00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
to get more animals
and rescue them.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important that
we do our part with the animals.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they certainly
do a part for us.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They always wait
for us when it's

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
our time to pass into
the spirit world.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.474 align:middle line:84%
They will be there right there
with-- and waiting for us,

00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:90%
and waiting, and waiting.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Many times, I've brought
through animals where they've

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
said to their owners, I'm
right there at the bed

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:90%
where I used to sleep all time.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I once had a dog come
through to its owner.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.362 align:middle line:90%
And the dog was a little upset.

00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And I know they go
beyond those emotions.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
But this dog said, my
owner got a new dog.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you got a new dog.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, your
dog got passed over.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:90%
I think his name was Bobby.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Bobby's OK with that,
except one thing.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:90%
She goes, yes?

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Bobby said that you're using
his bowl for the new dog.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And he would like you to get
a brand new bowl for the dog.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.690 align:middle line:90%
And she agreed to it.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:90%
She said, OK.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.701 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that.

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I will do that,
thank you right away.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's incredible.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So today's show, I thought
we'd bring on some animals.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.974 align:middle line:84%
And our lovely people
here at Gaiam TV,

00:09:03.974 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
they have their lovely pets
with them, some of them.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.692 align:middle line:90%
And I just met them briefly.

00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to
bring them on stage

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.774 align:middle line:84%
and first do a reading
for the animals.

00:09:10.774 --> 00:09:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Call me Doctor Dolittle.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.761 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great pet
psychic named Sonya Fitzpatrick

00:09:15.761 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:90%
who actually is still working.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.343 align:middle line:90%
And I did a radio show with her.

00:09:18.343 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:90%
She's very, very good.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.976 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to attempt
to do what Sonya does.

00:09:21.976 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's easy talking
with the animals.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
They're much easier
than the humans.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Because humans have
stuff in the way,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
where animals just
going through.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.902 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to bring out
some animals and the owners.

00:09:32.902 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see what we can do.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.765 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:35.765 --> 00:09:36.265 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go down here.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look at this corgi.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Hi, baby.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:90%
And this is a boy or a girl?

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Boy.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's a boy.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And what is his name?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.025 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Huckleberry.

00:09:48.025 --> 00:09:49.983 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Huckleberry,
you want some water?

00:09:49.983 --> 00:09:50.637 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:09:50.637 --> 00:09:52.112 align:middle line:84%
You can have-- he
can have water.

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Come here, buddy.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He already
drank a cup before the show.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So Huckleberry is a
sweet, sweet baby.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And Huckleberry would
have been the middle

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.865 align:middle line:84%
of the litter, probably,
middle of the litter.

00:10:01.865 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Did you get him
through somebody or did

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.698 align:middle line:90%
you hear about him somewhere?

00:10:04.698 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Did you go somewhere?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We got him from
a friend of ours, actually.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: From a friend,
heard about him, great.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.825 align:middle line:84%
And would there have been
a man involved with that?

00:10:10.825 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Was it a male friend?

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My father's friend.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
father's friend.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.338 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that it
came from a male friend.

00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:90%
And- look at him.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:90%
He loves it.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:90%
He loves being in the outdoors.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.780 align:middle line:90%
He loves being in the outdoors.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:90%
He loves to run.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:90%
He loves the outside elements.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.561 align:middle line:90%
He loves to dig.

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I can you say that, you know
him digging all the time.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I see him
digging all the time.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Come here, buddy.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.068 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Come on, buddy.

00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you want me to read you?

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.645 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to read you?

00:10:31.645 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you want come up on here?

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Go say hi.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah,
yes, I'll go down.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to your level.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.125 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's low.

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's low.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm low too in the human
standards, so that's all right.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's some water for you.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.362 align:middle line:84%
So I know that
there's no-- is there

00:10:48.362 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
another animal in your
place, like a cat?

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Or is there any other
animal you have or you had?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: In where he lives?

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.541 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, he lives
with a dog, another dog.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, because
he keeps on telling me here

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that he's not sure
about that other animal.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:90%
He's not sure about that.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.335 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if that other
animal steals his space where

00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:06.751 align:middle line:84%
he's sleeping all the time,
they fight, go back and forth,

00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:90%
trying to take his space?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, they--

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah?

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is the
other dog bigger?

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, much bigger.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.343 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Mm-hm.

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:15.186 align:middle line:90%
Don't like that.

00:11:15.186 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
He feels a little
bit-- hi, sweetheart.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I know, hi.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah he feels a little
bit intimidated.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I know you must give him
biscuits around 2 o'clock

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, we give
him a lot of biscuits.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that some things are OK.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.405 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
you just do dry food.

00:11:32.405 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do wet, too.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.571 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do wet?

00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And you just changed
it up recently?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He just got
a new bag yesterday.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.514 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There you go.

00:11:38.514 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I know that he's
OK with his food.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
He likes a little
bit of variety.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.729 align:middle line:90%
Now, he loves rabbits.

00:11:45.729 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loves rabbits.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: To eat or to chase?

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No, to chase.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.765 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: See, humans are
crazier than the dogs are.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%
He likes rabbits to chase.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:90%
He likes to run in the wild.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
If you can bring him
out there, do you

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:84%
have a field where you
can bring him out to?

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He actually--

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lives in a farm?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We have
a big backyard.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
He chases rabbits
in our backyard.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.991 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's what I'm--

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I'm trying to see things

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:90%
through his point of view.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I
love those rabbits.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I know that I love
to chase them.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And he loves squirrels.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loves
the squirrels.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Obsessed.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loves
the squirrels.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are
some rats or some mice where

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:90%
you live.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
that he's looking for them.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he
goes underneath there,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.444 align:middle line:84%
or wants to go underneath the
house or going under that area.

00:12:21.444 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Understand that?

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, did you
find him digging at one point

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.467 align:middle line:84%
under the house
or near that area?

00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
when he was younger,

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
he dug a hole under the porch
and ran under the porch.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.943 align:middle line:84%
And I had to dig a hole and get
under there and get him out.

00:12:32.943 --> 00:12:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.704 align:middle line:84%
So what he gives me,
what he tells me,

00:12:35.704 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is that there are
some rats there.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't call them rats.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.153 align:middle line:90%
We call them rats, humans.

00:12:39.153 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But that he's very
curious about that.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.237 align:middle line:84%
And I know that goes from
his breeding as well.

00:12:43.237 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you that
before that other person gave

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:84%
him to you, I think he was
with a woman at one time.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you that he
has memories of that woman.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you,
I don't like that.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like that because
I feel with him when he first

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:84%
started out that-- I don't
want to say abuse with her,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.479 align:middle line:84%
but I want to say
neglect in a way.

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to say that he was
by himself quite a bit.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.607 align:middle line:84%
And he does not
like to be isolated.

00:13:06.607 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:90%
You know that?

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.784 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to sit up on
the bench because this

00:13:09.784 --> 00:13:11.100 align:middle line:90%
is getting a little weird here.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.044 align:middle line:90%
Yes, kisses, kisses, OK.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he's not always
sure about people.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.418 align:middle line:84%
There must be a brand
new man in a house,

00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
or a man recently came
in that's new, yeah?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Um.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.705 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is there
new people in the house?

00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:22.552 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No?

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
There was recently a
man that came to visit.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:26.996 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh--

00:13:26.996 --> 00:13:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In his space?

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.454 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm trying to think.

00:13:29.454 --> 00:13:31.411 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't
know if it was a brother,

00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:90%
or it was a relative, a friend.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But there was a male
figure that came in.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, yeah, last week.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Last week, and
he would have worn a darker

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.183 align:middle line:90%
jacket, or a dark coat.

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:39.742 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
you remember that.

00:13:39.742 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't
remember a dark coat.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, and if
you walk into your place

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.420 align:middle line:84%
where you live, is there a place
where you put your jackets up,

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
like a hook or something?

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah-- oh!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.863 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right.

00:13:48.863 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.341 align:middle line:84%
So, because I know that
he didn't like him.

00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I know that he felt
very intimidated by him.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He did.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's
telling me that now.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:90%
He's saying that to me.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say
that I don't know

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:90%
if I like him in his space.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:00.845 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:00.845 --> 00:14:02.845 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's very
protective of his space.

00:14:02.845 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have the hardwood
floor somewhere, don't you?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.901 align:middle line:84%
Because he likes
that hardwood floor.

00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I see his piddy pads on that
hardwood floor running around.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I don't
know if it's a long hallway,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.157 align:middle line:90%
that is, yeah?

00:14:12.157 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
goes back and forth,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.156 align:middle line:84%
that hallway going
back and forth.

00:14:15.156 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
He loves the toys.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.570 align:middle line:84%
He loves some squeaky
toys, very much so.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the ones with
the perfume or the smell.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So you got to be very,
very careful of that.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Because he's very,
very sensitive to that.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that sometimes he

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.374 align:middle line:84%
must go up and lie on
the pillow in the bed.

00:14:27.374 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
it's his favorite spot.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.726 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:29.726 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He loves that.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:90%
It's his favorite spot to go.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:90%
So I got to tell you that.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.758 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I loved you.

00:14:33.758 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:90%
You're great.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, he wonders how
long that other dog's

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.468 align:middle line:90%
going to stay there.

00:14:37.468 --> 00:14:38.416 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:38.416 --> 00:14:43.094 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.094 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We're
actually moving,

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:84%
so he won't be with him for
just a couple more months.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.398 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He knows it.

00:14:49.398 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.272 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He knows it.

00:14:51.272 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:90%
He knows it.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:90%
He looks forward to that.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think animals are
great together-- socialization,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:90%
they need socialization.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.668 align:middle line:84%
But that dog there, it's just--
it's a different vibration.

00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just a different energy.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And that older dog,
or the bigger dog,

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.155 align:middle line:84%
needs a little
bit more attention

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:08.072 align:middle line:84%
than this dog does, or
tries to get attention.

00:15:08.072 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And this one's like, come on.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:90%
This is my house.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:90%
This is my place.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.709 align:middle line:90%
Stop this, you know.

00:15:11.709 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:90%
This sort of thing.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know that
you've got be very, very

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.484 align:middle line:84%
careful at dinner time,
around 7 o'clock at night.

00:15:16.484 --> 00:15:17.983 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
you're giving scraps,

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:90%
or you're cooking something.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:90%
He's looking at you like that.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.582 align:middle line:90%
And I'm giving him something.

00:15:22.582 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.081 align:middle line:84%
And do you have a
butcher block table

00:15:25.081 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:90%
where you-- in the kitchen?

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Not a table--

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A center
island or something there?

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I know that he

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
sits in front of that
when you're cooking.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:90%
The sink is here.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And I see that over there.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.670 align:middle line:90%
And you're giving scraps.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to say
be very, very careful.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.165 align:middle line:84%
Because there are certain
things that his digestion

00:15:37.165 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:90%
is very, very sensitive.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And he could be very
allergic to certain things.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.303 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
so like carrots, I'm

00:15:42.303 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:90%
not sure about the carrots.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I think carrots
you've been giving him.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.669 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He eats everything.

00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:49.085 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
see and that's

00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the part where the human has
to have responsibility, OK?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because we want
him to live as long as we can.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:90%
He's very happy with you.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
He likes you-- are
you with a man?

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.041 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah?

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.925 align:middle line:90%
He likes you more.

00:16:00.925 --> 00:16:02.244 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:90%
You know that, though.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do know that.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And it's
really a matter of energy.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the frequency.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:90%
And he feels that you're his.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:90%
And he's yours.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.735 align:middle line:84%
And when that man comes by, he's
not overly crazy about that.

00:16:13.735 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.715 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now, I'm not going
to say it's like the emotion

00:16:15.715 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:90%
that humans have.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just energetically.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.300 align:middle line:90%
So you'll just know that.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.970 align:middle line:90%
And I like this dog.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I like a lot more
water, obviously thirsty.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But needs more
water all the time.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.877 align:middle line:84%
And I don't like putting him
outside, leashing him up there.

00:16:27.877 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, I don't do that.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the
lady-- the first did that.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the lady that had him
at the very beginning used

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.354 align:middle line:84%
to put him on a leash
for a long, long times.

00:16:35.354 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:90%
And didn't that.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He also likes
to look out the window.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He loves it.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.015 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He loves
looking at what's

00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:90%
going on outside the window.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:40.927 align:middle line:90%
And I like that.

00:16:40.927 --> 00:16:42.468 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask
you one more thing.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:45.151 align:middle line:84%
Is there a car with like a back,
like a station wagon or an SUV?

00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I love him in there.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:90%
He loves to be in that ride.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.752 align:middle line:90%
I love the doggie bed.

00:16:49.752 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So I thought there must be
a doggie bed in that back.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.106 align:middle line:84%
Because he loves to
stay in that doggie bed

00:16:53.106 --> 00:16:54.106 align:middle line:90%
and look out the window.

00:16:54.106 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there you go.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.213 align:middle line:90%
And just look at his diet.

00:16:58.213 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:90%
He seems fine.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Make sure his diet.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And might
have been trouble with worms

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.527 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Huh, OK.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
just watch for that.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:90%
But I feel pretty healthy.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:90%
He's all yours.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:90%
All right, honey?

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: All right.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:08.923 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:17:08.923 --> 00:17:10.881 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: All right,
thank you, sweetheart.

00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, baby.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I know, a lot of people.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
You can go right down
there, that's great.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:90%
Come on, Buddy.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:17.880 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's interesting.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.692 align:middle line:84%
You ever feel depressed,
you feel down,

00:17:19.692 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
you feel out of sorts; you just
have an animal come and sit

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:90%
there with you.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.026 align:middle line:90%
And just feel the energy.

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:90%
Just pet the animal.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
It really does
release the hormone.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.462 align:middle line:84%
And you really will feel
much better, of course.

00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how much we
give to the animals.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.149 align:middle line:90%
They give us so much.

00:17:32.149 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
have a second dog come on.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We'll see what we get
for the second doggie.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And dogs, of course,
it's just energy

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.284 align:middle line:90%
that I'm reading with them.

00:17:38.284 --> 00:17:40.684 align:middle line:84%
Some dogs are very, very open
as far as letting you share

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and getting into
their head space,

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.391 align:middle line:90%
and others are very protective.

00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:90%
So here's our next lovely.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Is this Lola?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.265 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: This is Lola.

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.223 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Hi, Lola.

00:17:47.223 --> 00:17:48.207 align:middle line:90%
Lola's a girl or a boy?

00:17:48.207 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lola's a girl.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: A girl.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.277 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Lola.

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:90%
You want some water?

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Hi, baby.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a new space.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.279 align:middle line:84%
She always wonders
where she's going.

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:90%
She always wonders, new spaces.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
She's not comfort--
first five minutes,

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:84%
she'll be-- but once she feels
the energy, she'll be fine.

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:03.284 align:middle line:84%
Very psychic dog,
very intuitive dog.

00:18:03.284 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And she's very, very,
again, protective.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
There must be three people
in the house around you?

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: There are.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, three
people in the house.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My wife,
my daughter, and I.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your wife and
your daughter and you, yep.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:84%
She says she's with
the three people.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.037 align:middle line:90%
And she likes you.

00:18:13.037 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there was a
thought about having another

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
baby, or getting someone
else in that house,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.308 align:middle line:84%
or there was a thought of--
if you had a miscarriage,

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:20.590 align:middle line:90%
or there was--

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.299 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My wife
had two miscarriages.

00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:24.381 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I
know that the dog tells me

00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
there are three, but there's
one running around, spirit.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So not
the two, just the one.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So the other one's in the
spirit-- they're all-- but when

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:84%
we go to the other side,
we see them many times.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
We will see them when
it was a miscarriage.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:90%
But I know it was a boy.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.052 align:middle line:84%
And I know he plays with
the girl, your girl.

00:18:37.052 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very,
very interesting.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are you
the second owner of Lola?

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We got her
from Humane Society.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love
that you saved her life.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.863 align:middle line:90%
I loved that you saved her life.

00:18:47.863 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And she appreciates that every
single day, every single day.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.081 align:middle line:90%
And Lola-- hi, Lola.

00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:53.955 align:middle line:84%
Your leg's been bothering
you a little, baby?

00:18:53.955 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Her leg has been bothering
her a little bit.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really?

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I don't
know if it's a hind leg,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.316 align:middle line:84%
or there's been a
little bit of something

00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
with a bone, something
with the bones.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.361 align:middle line:84%
So there might be just a
little bit of arthritis.

00:19:04.361 --> 00:19:06.424 align:middle line:84%
And you might notice
that with her hind leg.

00:19:06.424 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
You haven't noticed
it yet, right?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.948 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And was she into the
vet just recently?

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She was--
yeah, not too long ago.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like
two weeks ago?

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: A little
more than that, yeah.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.074 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
did the vet say

00:19:17.074 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
that she has to have
an x-ray or something?

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No,
but she was found

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.209 align:middle line:84%
to be hyper thyroid--
I'm sorry, hypothyroid.

00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So she needs
a pink pill every day.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.380 align:middle line:90%
You just started the pink pills?

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.245 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Not just-- probably
within the last six months.

00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Right, I like that.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:90%
My dog also has that.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is very
common with dogs.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.924 align:middle line:84%
And does she hang out underneath
the dining room table?

00:19:39.924 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No, not so much.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Whenever
you're eating.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.181 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She-- no, no.

00:19:43.181 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:84%
She likes to wedge herself
between the armchair

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:90%
and the side table.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:84%
That's like a little,
that's her safe--

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.985 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:19:50.985 --> 00:19:53.435 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I like that furniture
over me, or around me

00:19:53.435 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%
to feel secure.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
she said you don't

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:90%
use that dining room anyway.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.832 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:59.832 --> 00:20:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She
just said that to me.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't use that
dining room anyway.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
He likes to sit with that chair
you can go all the way back.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There
must be a room

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
with a television set there.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
where the TV is.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:09.945 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And that's
where you hang out?

00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
that what she shows me.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you watch
games or things like that,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:90%
but she's there with you there.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Could
I say that she'd

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
be-- I feel equally between
you and your wife, as far

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.546 align:middle line:84%
as she loves you
both very much so.

00:20:22.546 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that your wife needs her
a little bit more than you do.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I can say that to you.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel there's a
connection there with her.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, as she gets older,
she also has heart stuff.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:90%
So just be aware of that?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.920 align:middle line:90%
How old is she, seven, eight?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She's six.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Six.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She'll
be seven in April.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Seven in April,
so around the age of eight--

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
I just want to check and
make sure her heart's OK.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels
like that's something

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
that she said be aware of.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I think she's very
good exercise.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.994 align:middle line:90%
She likes to walk with you.

00:20:46.994 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
She loves walks.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I think
the weekends are a big deal.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
She looks forward
to the weekends.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So you guys must go out on
a big walk on the weekends.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do, yeah.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
she loves that.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:90%
She loves that.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
She love some of those dogs,
not all the dogs, the dog park.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She loves some
of them, not all of them.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And she makes it known.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.895 align:middle line:84%
And I know there
must be-- do you

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
have a second story
to your house?

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's a
second floor, correct?

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Because as I go with her up the
stairs, up the stairs there,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:90%
she's smelling everything.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.794 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if there
was some new carpeting put

00:21:13.794 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
in recently, or there's some new
furniture or something up there

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:90%
at all?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We painted my
daughter's bedroom recently.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Is that off to the right
side as you go up the stairs?

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, as you go
up to the right, exactly.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You turn
to the right, correct?

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that that smell bothered her.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really?

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
smell bothered her.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.825 align:middle line:90%
And it was like this--

00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:32.069 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:21:32.069 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She knows
you didn't mean it.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But she's just telling me
that the smell bothered me.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.485 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
been about a month ago,

00:21:37.485 --> 00:21:38.986 align:middle line:84%
a month a little
bit more than that.

00:21:38.986 --> 00:21:39.943 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Six weeks ago.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And she's very
much-- she loves you.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:90%
She's very loyal, of course.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I need to ask one
more thing to you.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Are there other little
animals around your house?

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's got a brother,
another dog, yeah, Kona.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.284 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, Kona,
looks very much the same?

00:21:54.284 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Same size, yeah.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Different breed?

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Different breed,
a mixed, also a rescue.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I like Kona.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:21:59.915 align:middle line:90%
I like them together.

00:21:59.915 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:90%
I like them together.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.057 align:middle line:84%
Now, opposed to that
first dog that came in,

00:22:03.057 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:90%
she likes to have company.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
She likes another
animal with her.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I know that she
loves her food, of course.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.564 align:middle line:84%
But I also love-- she
loves the washing.

00:22:10.564 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:90%
She loves getting the baths.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.940 align:middle line:90%
She loves getting clean.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:13.999 align:middle line:90%
She likes to be clean.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Much more
than Kona does, yeah.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She likes it.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%
She looks forward to it.

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Really?

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, she does.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, have you tried doing
it outside the house once?

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:21.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.040 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And do you ever give her rawhide
bones or bones to chew on?

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We-- yeah, we have.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.577 align:middle line:84%
She shares our office here at
Gaiam with several other dogs.

00:22:35.577 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And she steals rawhides
from the other dogs.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.409 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's it.

00:22:38.409 --> 00:22:39.603 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:22:39.603 --> 00:22:41.853 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She's the culprit
when someone's missing--

00:22:41.853 --> 00:22:43.686 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That is
her mission every day.

00:22:43.686 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
When she comes to Gaiam,
she looks for that rawhide.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
that is her mission.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:90%
That is her mission.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
There must be a
black dog in Gaiam

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:90%
around where she looks at.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:51.585 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:22:51.585 --> 00:22:53.543 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
the black dog is spoiled.

00:22:53.543 --> 00:22:56.727 align:middle line:84%
And the black dog has
all the good stuff.

00:22:56.727 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:90%
The black dog.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And she loves being here.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.213 align:middle line:90%
She loves going on these jaunts.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I love going out, of
course, out the window.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:90%
She likes the air.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
She likes looking out
the window very much so.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Loves it.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I love those walks.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.233 align:middle line:84%
She really looks
forward to the walks.

00:23:09.233 --> 00:23:13.255 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you must have
a little beddy for her, a dog

00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:13.755 align:middle line:90%
bed.

00:23:13.755 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And is it
underneath a heating unit,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.671 align:middle line:84%
like a radiator, or something--
a heating unit near it?

00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:19.315 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
close to a floor

00:23:19.315 --> 00:23:20.690 align:middle line:84%
vent, very close
to a floor vent.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So, I just
want-- she said to me,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:23.255 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it gets too hot.

00:23:23.255 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So just be
aware of where you place that.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes it's a
little bit too hot for her.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.465 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's why she
jumps up on our bed then.

00:23:29.465 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's why
she jumps up on the bed.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because animals are very, very
sensitive to temperatures.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
tell you, it happens

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:84%
around 1 o'clock in the morning
that the temperature goes up.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.017 align:middle line:84%
So you'll have to
look and see that.

00:23:40.017 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:84%
You might just move it
a couple inches away.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But she's very
sensitive to that.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.201 align:middle line:84%
I also want to put
water over there for her

00:23:45.201 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:84%
when she's at
that-- near the bed.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:47.842 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:47.842 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't have it
in her room, but--

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what she told me.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.325 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:52.325 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.533 align:middle line:90%
We've got to train these humans.

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:90%
We've got to train them.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.144 align:middle line:90%
Any questions you have?

00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name?

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Don.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don,
nice to meet you, Don.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Nice to meet you.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Didn't
even ask the human.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.075 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don, do
you have any questions

00:24:03.075 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to ask?

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
See if-- what--

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just sometimes
she-- like you said,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:90%
she doesn't like all dogs.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
She can be quite aggressive
towards smaller dogs,

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and mainly females.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.782 align:middle line:90%
And I want to curb that.

00:24:16.782 --> 00:24:19.714 align:middle line:84%
Because she'll go after them,
and she'll clamp on them.

00:24:19.714 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't bear down.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:90%
But she'll-- and it's annoying.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Got it.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because
our other dog

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is just wonderful
with other animals.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.164 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Got it.

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.939 align:middle line:84%
She was in a cage
when she was younger.

00:24:27.939 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
That's where it
comes from, she said.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So when she was in that cage,
she had other dogs there,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and there was one Chihuahua mix
that was barking at her a lot.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you something.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I feel that dog
tried nipping at her.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And she remembers that.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tell her that
it's all right, that that's OK.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:44.695 align:middle line:84%
That was just the
past, not anymore.

00:24:44.695 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:90%
She got it.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:48.650 align:middle line:90%
She said she got it.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.858 align:middle line:90%
She'll do her best, she said.

00:24:49.858 --> 00:24:50.879 align:middle line:90%
She's very unsure.

00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.239 align:middle line:90%
OK, I got it.

00:24:52.239 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But she's you very
much into control.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
She likes to be in control, and
she likes to own this space.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.120 align:middle line:84%
She likes to hear the TVs at
night, the sounds of the TV,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and playing movies in the TV.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.455 align:middle line:84%
And that puts her
right to sleep.

00:25:04.455 --> 00:25:05.087 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, she's great.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.211 align:middle line:90%
And one more thing.

00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:08.375 align:middle line:90%
Did she ever have a scar?

00:25:08.375 --> 00:25:11.046 align:middle line:84%
Or was she ever
fixed in some way?

00:25:11.046 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She was spayed.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Spayed, uh-huh.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:90%
That was OK?

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything worked
out fine with that?

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.125 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I
believe she-- yeah,

00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:19.735 align:middle line:90%
she was spayed when we got her.

00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:90%
So, she had already--

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't like
with that rescue, when

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
she was in that
cage, the kennel.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But
you've rescued her.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.898 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
wonderful thing to do.

00:25:26.898 --> 00:25:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.140 align:middle line:90%
She rescued us, too.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And is your
wife's birthday coming up?

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.432 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a birthday
celebration soon?

00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My
daughter's birthday.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your daughter's.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, coming up.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: When is that?

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And mine's
actually in a couple weeks.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Couple
weeks, thank you very much,

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
because she's just
said, happy birthday.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:84%
She just said, there's
a birthday coming up.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting excited
for it because there

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
people at the house.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be things
that are going to happen.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I know
there's excitement.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.380 align:middle line:90%
There's a birthday coming up.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And she said that to me.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there's
going to be a celebration.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.049 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're a
good guy, too, Don.

00:25:56.049 --> 00:25:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I think you're very good.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.298 align:middle line:90%
You take care of your family.

00:25:58.298 --> 00:26:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You're very even-keeled,
nice person.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So thank you for
taking care of Lola and Corey.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you very much.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.048 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:26:06.048 --> 00:26:07.173 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Let's go, Lola.

00:26:07.173 --> 00:26:11.597 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.597 --> 00:26:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So for
everybody sitting

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
in the audience, and you
people at home as well,

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.680 align:middle line:84%
you can-- as we sit
here with the dog,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.221 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to
tune into the dog,

00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
too, and see what
you can pick up

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.660 align:middle line:90%
for the next dog that comes in.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And we'll work together,
and we'll see what you get,

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:90%
if you pick up something.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.589 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it interesting just
to see-- because the energy is

00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
so different with each
animal, just like each human.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And just we'll see
what you guys get, too.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that fun?

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.810 align:middle line:84%
All right, so now we
have a really big dog,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:90%
a Malamute, I believe, right?

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
and your name is?

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm Wendy.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Wendy, hi Wendy.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:90%
And this doggie is?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Chilkoot.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Chilkoot!

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Chilkoot!

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He's named for
the Chilkoot Pass in Alaska.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.226 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
isn't he a sweetheart?

00:26:46.226 --> 00:26:47.325 align:middle line:90%
You want some water?

00:26:47.325 --> 00:26:48.783 align:middle line:84%
You're gonna knock
that right over.

00:26:48.783 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:90%
We'll move that.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Chilcoat.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.545 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Chilcoat.

00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Chilkoot.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.079 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Chilkoot,
give me lovings.

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you want to lie down.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.580 align:middle line:90%
You can lie down.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.001 align:middle line:90%
Here, where you are.

00:26:59.001 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:90%
You can trust me.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So he loves to be
petted, obviously.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Are there are other
animals around as well?

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We have cat.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.004 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So he
didn't like this stage

00:27:08.004 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:90%
when we were up here before.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh it's OK.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.383 align:middle line:90%
I might just say, it's OK.

00:27:12.383 --> 00:27:15.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.730 align:middle line:84%
He has a favorite
blanket at home?

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He has
like a dog bed.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a padded bed.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
feels really secure.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.632 align:middle line:90%
And he loves that.

00:27:21.632 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
just told me that.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.732 align:middle line:90%
He's a very sensitive boy.

00:27:25.732 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very,
very sensitive, and he's

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.379 align:middle line:84%
very sensitive to the
energies in your house.

00:27:30.379 --> 00:27:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a lot of
windows in your house?

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I almost
feel it's a house of glass.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very much, yeah.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.023 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I really
got to tell you that.

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.912 align:middle line:90%
I feel he's so wolfie, this dog.

00:27:39.912 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
He's very much connected
with the wolves.

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:90%
Of course, he comes from wolves.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.690 align:middle line:84%
But he's a lovely animal,
but a very sensitive being,

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:47.610 align:middle line:90%
very sensitive.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:90%
He's a caretaker.

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.990 align:middle line:84%
He's very good at-- don't you
feel how great his energy is?

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he's very, very good.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like certain people.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like people
surprising him at the house.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.140 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like
people surprising--

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.115 align:middle line:84%
coming up to the
door and surprising.

00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't like that.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.433 align:middle line:84%
He has his own thing he
likes to do in that house.

00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:90%
He owns that space.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It's his space.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you have
a four poster bed?

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.785 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He tells me that.

00:28:13.785 --> 00:28:14.785 align:middle line:90%
That's what he tells me.

00:28:14.785 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know that-- I
know that he would

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:84%
love to get up there,
that four poster bed.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He sometimes has--

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
likes to go up there,

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.174 align:middle line:84%
but he's not sure
about it, you see.

00:28:23.174 --> 00:28:24.340 align:middle line:90%
But he likes to go up there.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:24.923 align:middle line:90%
Come on, baby.

00:28:24.923 --> 00:28:26.306 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:28:26.306 --> 00:28:26.925 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:28:26.925 --> 00:28:27.800 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sit down.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.732 align:middle line:90%
Sit down, there.

00:28:28.732 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, there you go.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Want to lie down?

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.105 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Have my hand.

00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:35.353 align:middle line:84%
So I don't-- a couple
things let me just tell you.

00:28:35.353 --> 00:28:37.102 align:middle line:84%
He loves going up on
that four poster bed,

00:28:37.102 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:84%
but at the end of it, I see a
lot, and looking up for food,

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:90%
wanting food, wanting food.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes maybe
comes wanting food

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:90%
in the morning or something.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But he likes to go-- he
likes that four poster bed.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:90%
You said you had a cat?

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cat's tricky.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you want him
to wander around?

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.646 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He just
doesn't-- for some reason,

00:28:55.646 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
he doesn't like
this wood surface.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.318 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: How about that?

00:28:58.318 --> 00:29:00.744 align:middle line:84%
You just get your hair
all over my crotch, great.

00:29:00.744 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Come here.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Let him go down.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.238 align:middle line:90%
He wants to meet with people.

00:29:05.238 --> 00:29:06.594 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:06.594 --> 00:29:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He feels
more comfortable.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.083 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:29:09.083 --> 00:29:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's right.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So he feels-- he's very
sensitive to people.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:84%
There are some people he'll
like and some people he won't.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't like
surprises at that house,

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you right now.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:84%
He's very, very
sensitive to people.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you, very,
very sensitive to people.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I also got to tell
you, his eyesight,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.351 align:middle line:84%
one is more powerful than
the other in his eyes.

00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:27.391 align:middle line:90%
Like, one is outstanding.

00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:90%
And then one is OK.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He was
actually attacked

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:84%
by a pit bull a few months ago
and almost lost his right eye,

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:90%
and had surgery on it.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, I see that.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.166 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Huh.

00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You like that?

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But he's just
giving me that sense

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that one eye's better than
the other one, is stronger.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I also got to tell you,
I think you keep really,

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.390 align:middle line:90%
really good care of him.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I really honor you for
taking care of him.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really
in tune with him.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean you, you are him.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.439 align:middle line:90%
He is you.

00:29:54.439 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:90%
It's really, really true.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We're pretty close.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.535 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
I know you must

00:29:57.535 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:84%
have-- are there three
bowls you have down.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.659 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He has--
well, he usually has two--

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, you have
big things, like a trough.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He has
two silver bowls.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.269 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And then
there's another one, no?

00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Our cat has a bowl.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:90%
But he usually has two.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The
cat has a bowl.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I know I see three down
on the floor there.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The cat's OK.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I think they could
be good friends.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They are, actually.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.658 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think they
could sleep together, too.

00:30:18.658 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We had Mocha--
Mocha's like 17 now.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:23.847 align:middle line:84%
So we had him when
he was a puppy.

00:30:23.847 --> 00:30:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He respects Mocha.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:84%

does respect Mocha.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
he's good to him.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.568 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can
I come down here?

00:30:28.568 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good boy.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
there's something

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.430 align:middle line:90%
about this he doesn't like.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
yes, that's OK.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give
you some lovings.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:90%
You like some lovings?

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And you don't give
him chew toys, do you?

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.288 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, he
doesn't really--

00:30:39.288 --> 00:30:41.239 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He
doesn't like chew toys.

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.780 align:middle line:84%

bones with meat.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.113 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And where's Daddy?

00:30:44.113 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:90%
He wants to know.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.189 align:middle line:90%
He misses his Daddy.

00:30:46.189 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:90%

>>AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He wants
to play with Daddy.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.672 align:middle line:84%
Daddy gets a little rough
with him sometimes they play.

00:30:50.672 --> 00:30:51.380 align:middle line:90%
They rough house.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
like to run together.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:90%

He loves rough housing
with Daddy, he says.

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I know there must
have been photographs

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:57.931 align:middle line:90%
taken of him recently.

00:30:57.931 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:90%

photographs of him

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.766 align:middle line:90%
on a wall where you live?

00:31:03.766 --> 00:31:04.271 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do.

00:31:04.271 --> 00:31:06.510 align:middle line:84%

00:31:10.924 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.206 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and where is the room
that you all go and relax in?

00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: You know, honestly,
the room that we spend the most

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:84%
time with him, we have
this very big kind

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of dining room, great room
thing that we hang out in there.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.702 align:middle line:84%
And he likes to be
there, probably there

00:31:25.702 --> 00:31:26.410 align:middle line:90%
most of the time.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.195 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's a people dog.

00:31:27.195 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.810 align:middle line:84%

he's a lot bigger than he is.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.184 align:middle line:90%
He thinks he's a horse.

00:31:35.184 --> 00:31:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Do you have horses
around your property?

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We do, yeah, we do.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
he talks about horses

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.640 align:middle line:90%
around the property.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And he thinks he's one of them.

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And he talks to those
horses all the time.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
our back fence--

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perimeter.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
a horse pasture.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:50.368 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, and don't
be surprised in the afternoon

00:31:50.368 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:90%
if he talks to the horses.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:90%
If you let him out there--

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, he's
out there all the time.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He'll
be free out there.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.096 align:middle line:90%
It's good to run him free.

00:31:56.096 --> 00:31:57.220 align:middle line:90%
He'll talk to those horses.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And they like each other.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:84%

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.830 align:middle line:84%

horses over there.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.913 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He likes them.

00:32:01.913 --> 00:32:04.980 align:middle line:84%

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.440 align:middle line:90%
I really like-- I love his life.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had his life.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And I like the horses.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you do.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And is there anyone
named Charlie around,

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Charles or Charlie?

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.476 align:middle line:90%
Whether living or dead?

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Charlie.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.559 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Or a friend
named Charlie he plays with?

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Does he play with
any other dogs?

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Not too much,
because mostly he's at home

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.140 align:middle line:90%
in the backyard and we--

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.265 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Look at that.

00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No, I don't
think any Charlies

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:90%
that I can think of.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
see if a Charlie

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
comes into the life, or
something with Charlie.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Because I like that for him.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:32.738 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:32:32.738 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.391 align:middle line:90%
That's what I get.

00:32:35.391 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
honey, thank you.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.190 align:middle line:90%
You're going to go.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So it goes to show you that,
really, we can read each other.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:50.520 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.394 align:middle line:84%
I was just listening to
the dog and listening

00:32:52.394 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:90%
to them speak to me.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, not necessarily
was I able to get

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:84%
them to focus on me because
they're not used to,

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.862 align:middle line:84%
many times, that adults,
that someone hears them.

00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:02.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was just going
with the-- if you will,

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:84%
my mind was blending
to their mind.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.786 align:middle line:84%
And I was just seeing
their experiences,

00:33:06.786 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and what really came to
the surface, that either

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.090 align:middle line:84%
had to be known or
that sort of thing.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can really send
thought out there

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
if there's a question,
and ask the dog.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And the dog will
send it right back.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.819 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- like, the
humans have all the stuff

00:33:18.819 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:84%
in the way, all the judgment
and all the fears, limitations.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Animals are not like that.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.972 align:middle line:84%
So as I continue, I
just want to start

00:33:24.972 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:84%
working with animals
in the spirit world.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.199 align:middle line:84%
And there's a horse that comes
here with a father figure.

00:33:29.199 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So I know the horse
would have been--

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.948 align:middle line:90%
you would have had the horse.

00:33:31.948 --> 00:33:33.512 align:middle line:84%
And your father is
also passed over.

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's somebody
in the audience.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.292 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a woman.

00:33:36.292 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I have.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So I have-- anyone make sense
with a horse that passed over.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And your father's also
in the spirit world?

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's you.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, and that's you.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, great, and would
this be a horse

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.411 align:middle line:84%
that your father
would have known?

00:33:50.411 --> 00:33:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:51.868 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm right here.

00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:90%
May I come to you?

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.295 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing?

00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, and
what is your name?

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kathy.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.293 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kathy.

00:33:57.293 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Kathy.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I have this brown horse here
that would have known of you.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And the brown
horse-- I think there

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.380 align:middle line:84%
might have been another
horse also somewhere.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But I like the
brown horse for you.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:84%
Because this brown horse
wants to come for you.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.062 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know before
the horse passes over,

00:34:12.062 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:84%
there's some internal stuff
going on with that horse.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.353 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if the
diet had to be restricted,

00:34:16.353 --> 00:34:18.044 align:middle line:84%
or they couldn't
have the diet that it

00:34:18.044 --> 00:34:19.085 align:middle line:90%
couldn't eat for a while.

00:34:19.085 --> 00:34:20.044 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:34:20.044 --> 00:34:22.459 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: This is a different
horse than I was thinking.

00:34:22.459 --> 00:34:23.595 align:middle line:90%
I have had two horses.

00:34:23.595 --> 00:34:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about a brown horse.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
were both brown.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But this-- one of
them had a metabolic problem.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's the
one I'm talking about.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.663 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right, so the
one was a metabolic problem,

00:34:31.663 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:84%
or a diet problem, or they had
switch to the-- I hear you.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Tried switching
up the diet, tried

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.986 align:middle line:84%
switching up what it
was getting to eat.

00:34:37.986 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:84%
Even tried to get it
sunlight, or something

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:90%
changing the elements around.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.905 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell you
that you tried everything,

00:34:44.905 --> 00:34:46.659 align:middle line:90%
or they tried everything.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.854 align:middle line:84%
This horse is saying,
they tried everything.

00:34:48.854 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Not just you, but
they tried everything.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My husband's
a veterinarian.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.671 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
husband's a veterinarian

00:34:53.671 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: For horses,
and we tried everything.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
you tried everything.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Now I know that before
I said the name Charlie.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Charlie, I don't
know what that means.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that might apply to
you for someone, not an animal,

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.800 align:middle line:90%
but someone.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to say to you to bring
a message to your husband.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say thank you
on behalf of all the animals

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.370 align:middle line:90%
that he tried helping.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.137 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would have been aware
that your husband might have

00:35:18.137 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
thought about either-- I don't
know if he was going to retire,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:84%
or change a business,
you understand that?

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, and I just want to say,
based on the animal kingdom,

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
they don't want him
to do it right now.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They don't want
him to do it right now.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Little more time,
maybe a couple more years.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Because they really look up--

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's thinking five.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Perfect, perfect.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Because they really love him.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And if I go into his office,
and I see all the awards,

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:84%
or I see that on
the wall-- there's

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:48.100 align:middle line:84%
like certificates or diplomas
or something over there.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are
pictures of animals around.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
in our clinic.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
in your clinic.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.843 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And we're
just work with-- there

00:35:53.843 --> 00:35:55.690 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of veterinarians
in the clinic.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
I love that work.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Wasn't that interesting that
it came through for you?

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.126 align:middle line:84%
So on behalf of those animals
that have passed over,

00:36:01.126 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:84%
thank you to you, your
husband, and the staff,

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:84%
for your love and affection
for healing those animals.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, this brown
horse that comes in,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:90%
really, I get very emotional.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that your husband
or your team, or his team,

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.260 align:middle line:84%
might go out and
visit properties.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.167 align:middle line:84%
And go out and give
shots, or go do that.

00:36:19.167 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.184 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, horses mainly.

00:36:21.184 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Horses, great.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
they appreciate that.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know your dad
has also passed over.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your dad,
before he passes over,

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.107 align:middle line:84%
I feel a bit ill
with your father.

00:36:30.107 --> 00:36:32.148 align:middle line:84%
And I know he went through
a period of being ill,

00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:90%
he says to me.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:90%
And he has this horse here.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Your horse is lovely.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:90%
He loves this.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when you
come to this side of life,

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.210 align:middle line:84%
you can make any
environment you want.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And there definitely will
be animals and horses there.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they
help with your-- right,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I know these animals,
from their side of life,

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.780 align:middle line:84%
help you with your
practice down here.

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.842 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your husband
is very, very intuitive

00:36:53.842 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:90%
doing the work he does.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:56.707 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
your father wants

00:36:56.707 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:84%
me to tell you that it's all
different than he expected.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.260 align:middle line:84%
He never expected it to be
like this, where he's at.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:84%
He knows someone
named Bob, or Robert.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:90%
He knows that person, that name.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So someone in the spirit
world with that name.

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Just so we know.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:90%
So-- and he comes in.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.354 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask him
who had the diabetes?

00:37:15.354 --> 00:37:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Or was there a problem at
the end with the diabetes?

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:90%
You know this.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Are you a sister, or a friend?

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My daughter.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Daughter, stand up.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:90%
He's part of your-- that's your.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That was my dad.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
That's your grandpa.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Right?

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So you know about the--
I'm going to ask you both.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:90%
So one might not remember.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.952 align:middle line:90%
One will.

00:37:28.952 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So you know about the diabetes
before he passes over.

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.647 align:middle line:84%
It must have been some diabetic
situation going on there,

00:37:33.647 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and he had to be very,
very careful of that.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask
you, was he also

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.865 align:middle line:84%
in a hospital setting
when he passes?

00:37:40.865 --> 00:37:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he was
there for a couple of months

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:45.210 align:middle line:84%
or it was an extended
leave at one point?

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Short time.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.261 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Short time.

00:37:47.261 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Was he in once before then
came out, and had then

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.007 align:middle line:90%
back in finally?

00:37:50.007 --> 00:37:50.756 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:37:50.756 --> 00:37:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Like seven
months before or something?

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.811 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he's
just giving me that.

00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:84%
He's also give me a
sense here that we really

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what to do
toward the end with him.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what we should
do with him at the end.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know why,
but I can't breathe.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.504 align:middle line:90%
My heart is acting very strange.

00:38:05.504 --> 00:38:06.919 align:middle line:84%
And I can't-- it's
like [GASPING].

00:38:06.919 --> 00:38:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm short of breath.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And now my heart
is going like that,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.922 align:middle line:90%
the arrhythmia of the heart.

00:38:10.922 --> 00:38:12.130 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense to you, right?

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So when you
think of your grandpa,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:90%
think of the heart.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that also
is symbolic for him.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that there must
be a lady over there who

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.520 align:middle line:90%
would be his wife.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.659 align:middle line:90%
That would be your grandma.

00:38:22.659 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And that would be-- you'd know
her very, very well, she said.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And I know when she
was in the lifetime--

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and she has animals around
her, too, by the way.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:90%
There's some dogs.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
There's something
around this lady.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And these people, they
have their animals.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.618 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that.

00:38:33.618 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I know someone who liked
to feed stray cats sometimes.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.407 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We did
that as children.

00:38:40.407 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
your dad and your mom

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.280 align:middle line:84%
would come in here now and tell
me-- give me this impression

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:90%
about feeding the stray cats.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, there was one
time where there was a box,

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.380 align:middle line:90%
and one cat gave birth.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
litter with kittens.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And she said that.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
of remember that.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it was in a garage

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.450 align:middle line:84%
or it was in a barn,
or something like this.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.283 align:middle line:84%
But there was-- she's
telling me about there

00:39:01.283 --> 00:39:03.284 align:middle line:84%
was the cat that had the
babies, or the kittens.

00:39:03.284 --> 00:39:04.866 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, I
got in big trouble

00:39:04.866 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:84%
because my neighbor's
cat had babies,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and I told them that I
was allowed to have one,

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.322 align:middle line:90%
and I never got permission, so.

00:39:11.322 --> 00:39:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So that's
how we got a cat.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.964 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, OK.

00:39:15.964 --> 00:39:16.755 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:39:16.755 --> 00:39:18.213 align:middle line:84%
That's what she's
remembering this.

00:39:18.213 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And so did your mother die
before your father passed away?

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she made
everything perfect for him.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, she knew she had
to make it perfect for him.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Because she took care of
everything in the house.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She made sure
that everything ran perfectly.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:90%
She made the food.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:32.575 align:middle line:84%
She made sure that he
was taken care of 100%.

00:39:32.575 --> 00:39:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.316 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You know that.

00:39:34.316 --> 00:39:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know they're
both at peace now.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.844 align:middle line:84%
So, I think that you both are
pretty evolved spiritually.

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I can say that to you.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.009 align:middle line:84%
I can say, well, of course,
you work with the animals.

00:39:43.009 --> 00:39:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And you're very
compassionate people.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're very
open-minded people.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And I love working with you.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're open-minded,
you can learn and expand.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And everybody you
touch, you bring

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
your energy of
open-mindedness to and

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.570 align:middle line:84%
your compassion,
your healing, to.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:57.510 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you helped
your mother when she was dying,

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:90%
or when she was passing.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
She said she was dying,
and you helped her.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:90%
You helped her.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And I know that I couldn't move.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't walk and get around.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.109 align:middle line:84%
And she said she's able to
do that now so, so much.

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And if that's all you
hear today, she said,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:90%
that's where you need to hear.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:18.610 align:middle line:84%
I love that I want
to sit down where

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.791 align:middle line:84%
there are two
chairs in the house.

00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:23.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there
was-- you understand

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.270 align:middle line:90%
where that is, right?

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:84%
It's where the fireplace
might be, right?

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because that's
where she visits all the time,

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.232 align:middle line:90%
and your dad.

00:40:28.232 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Your dad's speaking with her.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.065 align:middle line:84%
So it's both of them
coming in at once.

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you, if I'm
sitting in one of those chairs,

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.988 align:middle line:84%
does one of those chairs
have a blanket on top of it?

00:40:35.988 --> 00:40:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
where she sits,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.540 align:middle line:84%
where the blanket is
on back of that chair.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Now, she
has those chairs.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.653 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They're at my house.

00:40:43.653 --> 00:40:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:45.930 align:middle line:90%
So I like that.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to tell you that I

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.420 align:middle line:90%
like the rug that's there, too.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And I don't if you're
going to replace that rug,

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.642 align:middle line:84%
or you just did,
or there was talk

00:40:52.642 --> 00:40:54.357 align:middle line:84%
about replacing that
little area there.

00:40:54.357 --> 00:40:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.538 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:40:56.538 --> 00:41:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I know you must have tea
or coffee there sometimes.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:00.965 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:00.965 --> 00:41:01.970 align:middle line:84%
My husband does
probably every day.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
husband does, OK.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I think he's a good
man, your husband.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And they like him.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.420 align:middle line:90%
They like him a lot.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:90%
They like him a lot.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:08.831 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there
must have been talk

00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:10.849 align:middle line:84%
about going on a
trip, a warmer trip,

00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:12.640 align:middle line:84%
going to warm climate
over the winter time.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is that right?

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
with your husband

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.090 align:middle line:90%
you were going to do that?

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And do
you also have a dog?

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I have two.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.260 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, I
love your doggies.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:20.880 align:middle line:90%
They're great.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.880 align:middle line:90%
They're great.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there a window box, or a
window seat, or something?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.277 align:middle line:84%
Or they like to go
by that window area?

00:41:27.277 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's a
couple of low windows.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Low
windows they look out.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.190 align:middle line:90%
They like to look out.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: They just look out.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:32.985 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just see that,
from their point of view,

00:41:32.985 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:90%
they're looking our here.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.450 align:middle line:90%
So I like that.

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Your mother, by the way--
I feel with your mom,

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.968 align:middle line:84%
if I go back here with her,
she talked about internally she

00:41:39.968 --> 00:41:41.110 align:middle line:90%
wasn't feeling good at all.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it manifested, and
it was a disease of some kind.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:90%
But it manifested.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.422 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel my
bones also messed up.

00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got to tell
you, I don't know

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.465 align:middle line:84%
if she was near
80, or right at 80.

00:41:51.465 --> 00:41:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 78.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: 78, very good.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.816 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that she
goes in life as far as

00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:90%
she can with that.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.097 align:middle line:90%
And she lived a good life.

00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And so did your dad.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And your dad's very proud, very
proud, and very proud of you.

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:01.510 align:middle line:90%
You have children, do you?

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.379 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Two
children you have?

00:42:03.379 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so they say.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.639 align:middle line:90%
And they love the kids.

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:90%
They love the kids.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'll leave you
both with that.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.380 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.295 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:42:10.295 --> 00:42:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I would
like to ask somebody

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
if you have a mother
that passed over

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:84%
who would know of the name of
either Betty, or Elizabeth,

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.190 align:middle line:84%
or that would be
significant to this lady?

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And a Caroline as
well, or a Carol.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Does someone know that?

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that your mom?

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.004 align:middle line:90%
Your mom passed over, correct?

00:42:33.004 --> 00:42:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.836 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, right, I
think I'm right with you.

00:42:35.836 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind if I come to you
for a message with your mother?

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And you have doggies, too.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.080 align:middle line:90%
You have dogies around, right?

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:44.603 align:middle line:90%
Would you mind standing, please?

00:42:44.603 --> 00:42:45.316 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:42:45.316 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
your names are?

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.005 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Lori

00:42:47.005 --> 00:42:48.005 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: And Charles.

00:42:48.005 --> 00:42:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Lori and Charles.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I need to ask you,
is your dad also

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.210 align:middle line:90%
passed over to the other side?

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And is
your dad passed over?

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
dad and mom are here.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:58.000 align:middle line:84%
But your dad and
mom passed over.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't know.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.042 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you, there's
a lady next to you as well.

00:43:01.042 --> 00:43:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if its on your
mother's side of the family.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.208 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if
it's an aunt of yours,

00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:07.316 align:middle line:84%
your mother's sister,
or her mother.

00:43:07.316 --> 00:43:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do you have
an aunt that passed over?

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have an Aunt Ruth.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: An Aunt Ruth.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And that would be on your
mother's side of the family?

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
who I'm getting.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put
her to the side.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:15.646 align:middle line:90%
Are you shocked?

00:43:15.646 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Where'd you think
you were coming today, darling?

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
I didn't think--

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: To a dance party.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I thought
maybe it was for her.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
are you related?

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, this
is my younger sister.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
would you stand, too?

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: This is Leanne.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's Leanne.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:29.005 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Leanne.

00:43:29.005 --> 00:43:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So did
you know your aunt also?

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Did you know her?

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes, very good.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.840 align:middle line:84%
So let me start here and
then work our way around, OK,

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.114 align:middle line:84%
because I know that I want
to talk about your mother.

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell
you your mother

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:39.947 align:middle line:84%
loves you more
than you ever know.

00:43:39.947 --> 00:43:42.238 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that your
mother found it very, very

00:43:42.238 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:84%
hard, she said, in this
life, in this human life.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:46.499 align:middle line:84%
She said, you know, I
really didn't belong there.

00:43:46.499 --> 00:43:47.790 align:middle line:90%
She never felt like she fit in.

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.879 align:middle line:84%
And she never felt
like she belonged here.

00:43:49.879 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, do you remember that?

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.184 align:middle line:90%
Would you understand that.

00:43:52.184 --> 00:43:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes?

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your-- if I
can say it to you this way,

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.439 align:middle line:84%
your mom, before she passes
over, around her late 60s,

00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:84%
she said there was a
condition or something

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.780 align:middle line:90%
happened to her in the late 60s.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.440 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know what that means.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.981 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
there might have been

00:44:07.981 --> 00:44:10.847 align:middle line:84%
a loss or something
emotionally happened to her.

00:44:10.847 --> 00:44:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She had
sugar diabetes, I think,

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.347 align:middle line:90%
about that time.

00:44:13.347 --> 00:44:14.596 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: About that time.

00:44:14.596 --> 00:44:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:15.955 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:15.955 --> 00:44:17.116 align:middle line:84%
It's something emotional
she's telling me

00:44:17.116 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that happened around 68 years
of age that really set her

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
on her way down, if I
can say it that way.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Just she almost loses her
sense of wanting to live.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know she has
family all over.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I know there would have
been a lot of brothers there

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:33.720 align:middle line:84%
in that family, or boys, men,
in the family on her side.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, but all of
them has passed away, too.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, but she
comes from a large family.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the spirit world,
there are brothers over there,

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.070 align:middle line:84%
like two or three brothers would
have been over there for her.

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:43.970 align:middle line:90%
You understand that, right?

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
I know she likes

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to use the pillow
when she was alive,

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that pillow on the
couch, or the duvet.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.685 align:middle line:84%
And she likes to sleep
there with the couches.

00:44:51.685 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:90%
You understand that, right?

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:53.135 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:53.135 --> 00:44:55.385 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because it's
a memory that she gives me.

00:44:55.385 --> 00:44:56.950 align:middle line:90%
And she's a very sensitive lady.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:58.992 align:middle line:84%
She does feel like she
doesn't fit in well here.

00:44:58.992 --> 00:45:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why the
drinking is in the family.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:01.500 align:middle line:90%
But there is.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.525 align:middle line:84%
So there's alcoholism
in that family.

00:45:03.525 --> 00:45:04.560 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You can say yes.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.320 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:90%
You understand that.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if that
affected your mom sometimes

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.422 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because, as
she comes to me-- and, again,

00:45:14.422 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:84%
it's so funny, because today
is a show about animals,

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:84%
but I get all these
animals around.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.964 align:middle line:84%
And I get animals
licking the face.

00:45:19.964 --> 00:45:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know if you
guys have a dog that does that,

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:90%
licks the face.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But on behalf of your family,
that's also kisses from them.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Your mother also-- I know that
she must have had glasses.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 'Yes.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because she's
talking to me about that.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.871 align:middle line:84%
And she's also talking
about living-- what?

00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.290 align:middle line:84%
She used to eat out of
cans, have canned food.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:41.775 align:middle line:90%
She liked canned food a lot.

00:45:41.775 --> 00:45:42.400 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.483 align:middle line:90%
She had canned food a lot.

00:45:43.483 --> 00:45:44.492 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know that she
would like her loaf--

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.820 align:middle line:84%
meatloafs and this
sort of thing.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Simple the better for her,
simpler the better for her.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.073 align:middle line:84%
And she says she
feels, toward the end,

00:45:52.073 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:84%
a little bit
depressed, your mother.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I got to tell you, at the end
I feel very, very depressed.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
it's overwhelming.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.640 align:middle line:90%
This life is overwhelming.

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I really don't want to live here
anymore, she's saying to me.

00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:05.472 align:middle line:84%
And she's very proud of
you, very proud of you.

00:46:05.472 --> 00:46:07.805 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if do you have
the tattoo on your shoulder?

00:46:07.805 --> 00:46:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a tattoo,
or had an eagle tattoo?

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.369 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:12.785 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have the tattoo?

00:46:12.785 --> 00:46:14.005 align:middle line:90%
Is it an eagle, or wings?

00:46:14.005 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
fairies on both shoulders.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.114 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about eagle
tattoos when we get married.

00:46:20.114 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah!

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.330 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Here are the animals,
eagle tattoo.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:25.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: His
last name is bird.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And there
you're wearing an eagle--

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
our wedding ring.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Woo!

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.178 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting goosebumps.

00:46:30.178 --> 00:46:32.095 align:middle line:90%
And I do this professionally.

00:46:32.095 --> 00:46:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it wonderful?

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: So she
likes the tattoos?

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:37.682 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love that.

00:46:37.682 --> 00:46:38.681 align:middle line:90%
I love you two together.

00:46:38.681 --> 00:46:41.186 align:middle line:84%
And can I just say that it's
a lease for both of you.

00:46:41.186 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you
were married before.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:44.080 align:middle line:90%
You were married before.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.850 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that this
is a new lease in your life.

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.432 align:middle line:90%
And which one has the children?

00:46:48.432 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Both of us.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Three kids?

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Who has three kids?

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I have three.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have the three kids.

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
two boys and a girl.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:54.098 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:46:54.098 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And you have two kids?

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have--
well, one-- one just

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.086 align:middle line:84%
passed away from my
wife had passed way,

00:47:00.086 --> 00:47:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and then she had five boys.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Is it a
girl who passed away?

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can I bring
her through for you?

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Brenda?

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.913 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going
to talk to Brenda for you.

00:47:07.913 --> 00:47:08.537 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:47:08.537 --> 00:47:09.145 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:09.145 --> 00:47:09.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Can
I just tell you

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.346 align:middle line:84%
that Brenda brought
the two of you

00:47:11.346 --> 00:47:13.320 align:middle line:84%
together, that Brenda
is really the one who's

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.510 align:middle line:90%
pushing you guys together.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And that I know that that
tattoo you were going to get

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.360 align:middle line:90%
is in honor of her as well.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.491 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:19.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Her daughter
wants the same one.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.708 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well, then her
daughter can get the same one,

00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:26.250 align:middle line:84%
but just so it will remind her
that she's with her always.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:26.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.770 align:middle line:84%
All the time, and
I'm very, very aware

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that the rings you
were looking at-- you

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.705 align:middle line:84%
were looking at
some special rings

00:47:31.705 --> 00:47:32.740 align:middle line:90%
We were talking about the rings.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, that's his.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.491 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's his.

00:47:34.491 --> 00:47:35.839 align:middle line:90%
What's-- no, don't like that.

00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I like that you guys are
going to have a ring together,

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:40.421 align:middle line:84%
or that you were thinking
about we should get something

00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:43.310 align:middle line:84%
together that brings us together
as far as uniform togetherness.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Just the
tattoos, pretty much.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The tattoos?

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Nope, you're going to get rings.

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
be expensive rings.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.674 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:47:48.674 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: No, you don't
need to have expensive rings.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:90%
It's just the intention.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the union and
the two of you.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee
you, you're going

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to find something-- I
don't even think its metal.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:59.345 align:middle line:84%
I think it's almost like a
rubber or string material.

00:47:59.345 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It's something.

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll find it.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.210 align:middle line:90%
You're going to find it.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You're going to find it.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:02.291 align:middle line:90%
Do not worry.

00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:03.479 align:middle line:90%
You'll find it.

00:48:03.479 --> 00:48:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Can I say that your daughter
is very, very proud.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And she helped to
get two of you.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.699 align:middle line:84%
And she wants to thank
you for everything to her.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:10.990 align:middle line:84%
There must've been a time
when she was in the hospital.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And did you visit her in
the hospital at times?

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And was it about a month worth
of time visiting her there?

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because,
as she comes in,

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.670 align:middle line:90%
they're doing a bunch of tests.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:22.280 align:middle line:90%
They're doing things for me.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.690 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to do
things, blood tests,

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and to do things with me.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And she said, after a while,
she was impatient about it.

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, she's in
it, and she's out of it.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes she's in it, and
sometimes she's out of it.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.935 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes she' like-- I'm
not going to say coma state,

00:48:33.935 --> 00:48:36.240 align:middle line:84%
but she' definitely out
of it, asleep a lot.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Or I like-- go on, uh-huh.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.000 align:middle line:84%
She talks about medications,
a lot of medications.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know the medications
were very strong for her.

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know some
these medications--

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.546 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say
it because that's

00:48:47.546 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
what I do-- I know they
were toxic for her.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say that.

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you
loved her so much, too.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.690 align:middle line:90%
You did.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Really, she loves your love.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:58.100 align:middle line:90%
She feels your love.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that the people
that took care of her,

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.910 align:middle line:84%
she goes form one area over to
another area, so one section

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:04.690 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital then another
section of the hospital.

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.215 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure it's
a regular section then

00:49:06.215 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:90%
she goes to an ICU.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.670 align:middle line:84%
There's going back
and forth here.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.159 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:12.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, and I know you
tried visiting her

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.400 align:middle line:84%
every single day, every
single day, every single day.

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know you must
have a pickup truck.

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:22.250 align:middle line:84%
You're a kind of guy that
would have a pickup truck.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the
bed is not great.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.080 align:middle line:84%
There's something in the
bed of that pickup truck.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Something's not right.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.224 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the
painting is peeling,

00:49:29.224 --> 00:49:30.515 align:middle line:90%
or there's something's scraped.

00:49:30.515 --> 00:49:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Or there's something with
the bed in that truck.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
got to look after it.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Watch it.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.845 align:middle line:90%
Take care of it.

00:49:34.845 --> 00:49:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
you've been moving furniture

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.260 align:middle line:90%
in the bed of that truck.

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.430 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.270 align:middle line:84%
You must've been moving
furniture recently

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.160 align:middle line:90%
with the bed in that truck?

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We're
talking about it.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
you're talking about it.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I see moving furniture from
one place one to another place.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.950 align:middle line:90%
So you're moving together.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah we're
moving in together.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I like that.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:51.460 align:middle line:90%
I like that a lot.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.790 align:middle line:90%
I like that a lot.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And your mom and
dad, I don't know

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.170 align:middle line:84%
if they're going
to like her or not.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.812 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:49:57.812 --> 00:49:59.395 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, my
mom, they love him.

00:49:59.395 --> 00:50:00.728 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, they love him.

00:50:00.728 --> 00:50:01.567 align:middle line:90%
OK, good, perfect.

00:50:01.567 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.066 align:middle line:90%
I was being safe here.

00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:06.615 align:middle line:84%
But it's like the son she
didn't have, that sort of thing.

00:50:06.615 --> 00:50:07.740 align:middle line:90%
I think-- what's your name?

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.135 align:middle line:90%
Carl?

00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Charles.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.775 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
you're Charles.

00:50:09.775 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.811 align:middle line:90%
Weird how it happens.

00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I told him.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't that weird?

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.756 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they come in and
go out, never know where.

00:50:17.756 --> 00:50:20.020 align:middle line:84%
But I know that you have to
be careful with your back.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.214 align:middle line:90%
Be careful of your back.

00:50:21.214 --> 00:50:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And don't overdo
it with the back.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Your daughter just
wants to come and say,

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:25.520 align:middle line:84%
thank you very much for
writing something to her

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.440 align:middle line:90%
and talking to her.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote a letter or
your wrote something to her.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.126 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I wrote a song.

00:50:30.126 --> 00:50:31.749 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
wrote a song for her?

00:50:31.749 --> 00:50:33.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, well she's really
appreciative of that,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:90%
really appreciative.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And she likes the long
drives, the drives as well.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you, is
she in a graveyard at all?

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.157 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, she's in
the Fort Logan Cemetery.

00:50:44.157 --> 00:50:45.115 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Cemetery.

00:50:45.115 --> 00:50:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And is there a white cross?

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.164 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:50:48.164 --> 00:50:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Because she gives me

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.460 align:middle line:90%
the impression of a white cross.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know that was very,
very hard for you to do that.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And she just wants it to be
easier for you, not harder.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:50:59.420 align:middle line:90%
And she's out of pain.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.000 align:middle line:90%
She no longer has pain.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:01.980 align:middle line:90%
She no longer has pain.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.290 align:middle line:90%
So I've got to give that to you.

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have a lovely
photograph of her out.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:07.110 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:08.026 align:middle line:90%
She looks very pretty.

00:51:08.026 --> 00:51:10.880 align:middle line:84%
It must be a school photograph
that she took, she tells me.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's
a beautiful thing.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I know that you must
be very-- yeah, I know.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Your father's proud of you.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Your daddy's proud of you.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.705 align:middle line:84%
I think he must have had his
own company at one time when

00:51:21.705 --> 00:51:24.210 align:middle line:84%
he was younger, his own-- he
started working for himself--

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:26.477 align:middle line:84%
or, who was in a farm at
one point, your daddy?

00:51:26.477 --> 00:51:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's a farmer.

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah,
daddy was a farmer.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:31.037 align:middle line:84%
Because I keep on seeing
that, the farm machines.

00:51:31.037 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I know he tried doing things for
himself, doing his own crops.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.619 align:middle line:84%
And he really worked
harder than he should have.

00:51:35.619 --> 00:51:37.220 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, he
died before his years

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.350 align:middle line:90%
because he worked so hard.

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:40.231 align:middle line:84%
His whole life, he
worked really hard.

00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And who built the house?

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Did he build his house?

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He had it built.

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He had it built.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:45.150 align:middle line:90%
But he redesigned it.

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.800 align:middle line:90%
He designed it.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.634 align:middle line:90%
He was on top of it.

00:51:46.634 --> 00:51:47.466 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I guess.

00:51:47.466 --> 00:51:48.079 align:middle line:90%
I don't know--

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, he's
really proud of you.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And was there a twin
that passed away?

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have been
an accident of the passing.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:56.148 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not sure if
it'd be drowning

00:51:56.148 --> 00:51:57.230 align:middle line:90%
or there was an accident?

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had a
brother that drowned.

00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, you had
a brother that drowned.

00:51:59.560 --> 00:51:59.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm mixing it up then.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.721 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it was a drowning
with a brother of yours.

00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:06.785 align:middle line:84%
God, you had a whole
bunch of things going on.

00:52:06.785 --> 00:52:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
him when you were

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.450 align:middle line:90%
younger playing on a swing?

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I know it was a tire
swing some time?

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you have that memory
of the tire swing?

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, definitely.

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.691 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Definitely, good.

00:52:18.691 --> 00:52:21.720 align:middle line:84%
As your brother comes in, I
just want to go with that sense

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.009 align:middle line:84%
that that memory that
you used to have,

00:52:24.009 --> 00:52:25.550 align:middle line:84%
push each other with
that tire swing,

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and you used to play military
with each other and do things.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:29.561 align:middle line:90%
And there must've been a creek.

00:52:29.561 --> 00:52:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Or there must've been a lake.

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Or there must've been a pond
close to where that was.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Not
too far away, yes.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Not
too far, OK, great.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.270 align:middle line:90%
He's talking to me about that.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.975 align:middle line:84%
And there must've been other
siblings you have as well.

00:52:39.975 --> 00:52:42.706 align:middle line:84%
Are there three or
four other siblings?

00:52:42.706 --> 00:52:44.179 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah,
there's about--

00:52:44.179 --> 00:52:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Seven altogether?

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: 10 of us altogether.

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.156 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, 10 of you.

00:52:47.156 --> 00:52:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Are there seven alive now?

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Three that passed over?

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Let me see, one,
two-- I have to count here.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It's
like horses doing--

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, they're--
they're stepchildren.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.280 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, well let
me just tell you something.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
get a little bit here,

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to
just continue on.

00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:09.095 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you that this
wedding is great, the union,

00:53:09.095 --> 00:53:10.260 align:middle line:90%
can I call it an union?

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're going to
do it outside, by the way.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I know you've decided to have
it outside, they tell me.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.648 align:middle line:84%
And your mother's
very, very proud.

00:53:15.648 --> 00:53:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Your mother loves
you very, very much.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.480 align:middle line:84%
She handpicked you, just
gonna tell you that.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:20.740 align:middle line:90%
You're one of the best ones.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I know you love the sunflowers.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So there must be some love of
sunflowers and flowers-- well,

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:28.348 align:middle line:84%
sunflowers especially she's
talking to me about sunflowers,

00:53:28.348 --> 00:53:29.247 align:middle line:90%
your mama.

00:53:29.247 --> 00:53:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look
for the sunflowers.

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You know she's around you
when you see the sunflowers,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.270 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a painting, whether
it's a print, sunflowers,

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.770 align:middle line:90%
she's there.

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:36.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going to
have your wedding outside,

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:38.410 align:middle line:90%
she said to me.

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going to have
a lot of flowers around that.

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:41.753 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I'm
going to be present.

00:53:41.753 --> 00:53:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there
are Mason jars.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:44.979 align:middle line:90%
This is very, very interesting.

00:53:44.979 --> 00:53:46.270 align:middle line:90%
She's talking about Mason jars.

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to do
something with the Mason

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.040 align:middle line:90%
jars for the wedding?

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.873 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, my
sister, on her wedding,

00:53:49.873 --> 00:53:53.842 align:middle line:84%
they had Mason jars
that they put--

00:53:53.842 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:84%
they hot glued the bases to
them to make them look --

00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Flowers.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, flowers.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Were they at the
end of the rows or something?

00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: They were at the
end of the rows, weren't they?

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:01.736 align:middle line:90%
On the chairs?

00:54:01.736 --> 00:54:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing that in my mind.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: They
were on the chairs.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.520 align:middle line:90%
That was my sister's wedding.

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm
seeing that in my mind.

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And she was in the spirit
world, your mother, then.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't she?

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Well, his mom.

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.700 align:middle line:90%
My mom's still here.

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your mom,
your mom, your mom.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, she's telling
me about this.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.676 align:middle line:84%
She's telling me
about that, about

00:54:14.676 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:90%
your sister's with the jar.

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.230 align:middle line:90%
She liked that.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
what we kind of copied.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know you're
going to do something as well.

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're going to do that.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.150 align:middle line:84%
She said you're
going to do that.

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I'm
going to be very proud

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be
under that tree with you.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.320 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be
under the tree.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if where you
picked that wedding plans out,

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:29.030 align:middle line:90%
you picked out a ceremony place.

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:30.165 align:middle line:90%
But there's a big tree.

00:54:30.165 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's
lots of trees.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.215 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's a big oak
tree, and she's gonna be there.

00:54:33.215 --> 00:54:36.502 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have-- really,
your father's so proud of you.

00:54:36.502 --> 00:54:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Your father's so proud.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.980 align:middle line:90%
You tinker with the cars.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.460 align:middle line:84%
You tinker with the motors
all the time, he said.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, you're
under that hood,

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.160 align:middle line:90%
and you're tinkering all around.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I used to.

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:44.873 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You used to.

00:54:44.873 --> 00:54:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And who's the Susan, or Suzie?

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Who's that?

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:48.635 align:middle line:90%
Susan or Suzie?

00:54:48.635 --> 00:54:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: We
have a grandmother.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your grandmother
named Susan or Suzie?

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.363 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Great grandma.

00:54:52.363 --> 00:54:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In
the spirit world?

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:56.477 align:middle line:84%
Was she like the matriarch
of the family sometimes?

00:54:56.477 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:58.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know much--

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:00.293 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's a
Susan or Suzie over there.

00:55:00.293 --> 00:55:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go to a
basement that I open up

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:05.090 align:middle line:90%
the doors this way.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of those
basements you crawl down to,

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.050 align:middle line:90%
like a root cellar or something?

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:10.675 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That was
Aunt Ruth's house.

00:55:10.675 --> 00:55:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Aunt Ruth's had one.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Well,
she's here, too,

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and she just wants
you to know it.

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah?

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.165 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
she shows me that--

00:55:16.165 --> 00:55:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She's pretty feisty.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't
you hide down there.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You don't hide down there.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The things, don't
you hide down there.

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
was always telling

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:22.054 align:middle line:90%
us to stay off those doors.

00:55:22.054 --> 00:55:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Stay
off those doors.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:25.130 align:middle line:90%
So I like that.

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:26.782 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you something, too.

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you ever
wanted to do any nursing work,

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.100 align:middle line:84%
or work in the
hospitals, or work with.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.222 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Actually, I'm
a veterinary technician.

00:55:33.222 --> 00:55:34.180 align:middle line:90%
But I want to go into--

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.215 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Veterinary technician.

00:55:35.215 --> 00:55:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But I want to
go into grief counseling.

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Now,
what is that about?

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I know.

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:40.346 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm here
with animals and a vet.

00:55:40.346 --> 00:55:41.324 align:middle line:90%
I mean, hello.

00:55:41.324 --> 00:55:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: But I want to
go into grief counseling--

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I just saw
a beautiful nurse's cap

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:46.570 align:middle line:90%
over your head.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I see
that, it usually

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:48.940 align:middle line:84%
means the person
is a healer or they

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:90%
work in the medical fields.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And you do, obviously,
as a vet tech.

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think you'd
make a great grief counselor .

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I think you can see people.

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You feel people, and
you're compassionate.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.730 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I want to say,
the caveat to that, is this.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be the
best possible person

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.340 align:middle line:84%
you could be as far
as loving yourself.

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't love others
or be honest and have integrity

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.515 align:middle line:90%
when you're not there yourself.

00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very true.

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So
first we want to work

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:11.040 align:middle line:90%
on ourselves, meditation.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.662 align:middle line:90%
Get to that space of pure love.

00:56:12.662 --> 00:56:14.870 align:middle line:84%
That way, that they can see
that light on that level,

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:15.970 align:middle line:90%
everyone you interact with.

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit
world's around you,

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.010 align:middle line:90%
helping you to heal others.

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:18.830 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you with that.

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:20.621 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have very good surprise

00:56:20.621 --> 00:56:23.320 align:middle line:84%
after your wedding's done, a
very nice surprise come to you.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.153 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
either going someplace,

00:56:25.153 --> 00:56:26.522 align:middle line:90%
or-- I'm not going to spoil it.

00:56:26.522 --> 00:56:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
say flowers are there,

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.110 align:middle line:90%
where you're going to go to.

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:29.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a different location.

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And its' either a
visit or a trip.

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And your mom and dad
are making it happen.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'll leave you
guys with that, OK?

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

>>VAN PRAAGH: So I hope
it's evident to you

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:48.730 align:middle line:84%
today, all these strange
things that happen.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:49.522 align:middle line:90%
We have a vet tech.

00:56:49.522 --> 00:56:51.146 align:middle line:84%
We have a person
working with the vets,

00:56:51.146 --> 00:56:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and it's an animal show.

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.900 align:middle line:84%
I often think that the
spirit world, really, they're

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.519 align:middle line:90%
the masters.

00:56:56.519 --> 00:56:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They really are the puppeteers,
and we're merely the puppets.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And I think that.

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
everybody, today,

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.280 align:middle line:90%
go give your animal a kiss.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Feed your fish.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Pet your bird, your cat, and
your doggies and your horses.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.090 align:middle line:90%
Because they feel your energy.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:11.566 align:middle line:90%
Just know they feel your energy.

00:57:11.566 --> 00:57:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're here sharing
this planet with us,

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and we have to be
respectful to them.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So everybody here, I wish
you my love and light

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.280 align:middle line:90%
until we meet again.

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And everyone at home,
thank you very much.

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.750 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Buh-bye.
