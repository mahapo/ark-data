00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ANNOUNCER: And now,
world-renowned spirit medium,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.825 align:middle line:90%
James Van Praagh.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:32.062 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES VAN PRAAGH:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.014 align:middle line:90%
Hi, everyone.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining me
today on "Spirit Talk,"

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and thank you also at
home for joining me

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
on "Spirit Talk," where I take
you one step closer to heaven.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought today's topic
we would talk about

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
is something which many people
don't often use in their lives

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and they should more often,
and that is gratitude.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Gratitude.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
How many of you in the
audience, a show of hands,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.860 align:middle line:90%
use gratitude every day?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.712 align:middle line:90%
Oh, very good.

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
One, two, three, four, five--
well, in a couple of minutes,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
we'll really see how
you do use gratitude.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But gratitude, I think,
is very, very important,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
because gratitude
is really a sense

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
of being aware of
not only who we are

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.455 align:middle line:84%
and the place that we're
in but really having

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:19.592 align:middle line:84%
an appreciation for
ourselves in this world

00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:21.550 align:middle line:84%
and really having an
appreciation for the world

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're in and all
the situations that we

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:90%
have lived in.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Remember that you are
first and foremost a spirit

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:90%
having a human experience.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
important when you

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.385 align:middle line:84%
have that realization
that you take the time

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and you say, wait a minute,
what's happening to me?

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.060 align:middle line:90%
What lessons am I learning?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Who in my life
has helped me out?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Am I seeing things from
a good perspective?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And when we have gratitude,
we have a sense of love,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And with gratitude
comes love of self,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:84%
love of all the
experiences in our lives,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
love of those
people in our lives,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
really love and appreciation
of situations in our lives.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
It really gives us
a sense of love.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we have that
direction of love,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.570 align:middle line:90%
it comes back to ourselves.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
When you have gratitude
for something,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.597 align:middle line:84%
you really are, if
you will, giving love

00:02:05.597 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to all the experience in
your life, all the people

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
in your life, all
the situations.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And it also is very, very
helpful for your own health.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
With gratitude, you have a sense
of really living in the moment,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.330 align:middle line:84%
being in the moment when
you're in gratitude.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're somebody
who's afraid of things--

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.597 align:middle line:84%
and how many people here
have fear about things?

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people have fear.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Most people have fear,
because most people

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:90%
tend to live from fear.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
living from fear,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:90%
you tend to live in the past.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
So think about that.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So fear is really based
upon past experiences.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're living in
the moment right now,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in the present right
now in this moment,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.657 align:middle line:84%
you have no fear, because
you're living in the moment.

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:90%
So there is no fear.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:90%
So fear is from the past.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.014 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, it should.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It should make sense to
you, because when you're

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
living with fear, it's
from the past experiences.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.507 align:middle line:84%
But if you're living in
the moment right now,

00:02:58.507 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:84%
you're living in a sense
of this moment right now.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.415 align:middle line:84%
And I live in each
moment with a gratitude

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.049 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of being here.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
benefits to gratitude.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I often say to people, have
an attitude of gratitude.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
When you have a sense of--
an attitude of gratitude,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
you tend to bring out
loving people coming

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
into your life, better
situations coming

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
into your life,
benefits of health,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:90%
you lower your blood pressure.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's very,
very healthy for you,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
because you also have a sense
of calmness, a sense of balance.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to be in
your head worrying, fearful

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
when you're living in
the moment in gratitude.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.262 align:middle line:84%
So, it's really,
really important.

00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you live
in gratitude, you

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.506 align:middle line:84%
do have a sense also
of the certain lessons

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:90%
that you're learning.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
You kind of have a clearer
idea of what lessons your soul

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:90%
is learning at that moment.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You also have a
sense with gratitude

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.797 align:middle line:84%
of how other people are
treating you, what's the lesson

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that you're learning
from other people, what

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
value they have in your lives.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's really,
really important.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I try as best as I
can on a daily basis

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.254 align:middle line:84%
to really have
gratitude, to see, wow,

00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm walking down the street.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Look at that tree, how
beautiful that tree is.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful I am to be alive.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Every day I start my
day off with gratitude.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, the
universe, for giving me

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
another day to be here.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I have gratitude.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.540 align:middle line:90%
I have appreciation.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I have a thankfulness for
being here and sharing this.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:84%
So, what am I going
to learn today?

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
When we start our day off
with a sense of gratitude

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of
appreciation, imagine

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
how the rest of your
day will follow.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
If you sit with that
vibration of energy,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.035 align:middle line:84%
that level of energy,
of appreciation,

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
really, the universe
will bring to you,

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:90%
because we're all magnets.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:90%
We're magnets with our thoughts.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we think is
really manifested.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you come from a sense
of gratitude and appreciation,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:84%
really you're bringing yourself
to a higher level of awareness.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And you'll bring to you
those other situations

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
in your life of a higher
level-- love, compassion,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It works that way.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:90%
So try it out.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So, I thought today
we would start off

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
with-- I gave you all
a piece of paper here

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:90%
and a pen in the audience.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And you people at
home also can do this.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good thing to do.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really,
really important

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
that we, every once in
a while in our lives,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
we take a few--
when do I do this?

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Three times a year
maybe, four times a year?

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
I really seriously
do this-- where

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I sit and I assess my life.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.594 align:middle line:84%
And I see where I've
come from, where

00:05:22.594 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm at at this present
moment, and where

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.919 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to in the future.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really,
really important

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to have that sense
of assessment.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So I would like for you in
the audience here, and those

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:90%
at home, to make a list.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Make a list of five
things in your life

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:90%
that you have gratitude for.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Five things in your life
you have gratitude for.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:59.752 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So, for some of you
it comes very easily,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and for others it takes
a little bit of time.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.965 align:middle line:84%
I always find it
very interesting

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to see how that works.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.732 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no judgement--
just observation about it.

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, look at your list.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you're finished, you
can look at your lists.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And what does it feel like
as you look at each item?

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Just with a share of your
hand, if you put your hand up,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
what do you have
listed on your paper?

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My health.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your health.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very, very good.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Health.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
How many have health
in their list?

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.731 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:06:29.731 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:90%
What's another one you have?

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My family.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.395 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Family.

00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have
family or kids?

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Mostly everybody.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.601 align:middle line:84%
Who else has
something different?

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My work.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your work.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, why do you have
gratitude for your work?

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because I get to
help people with what I do.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You get to
help people with what you do.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So let me just go
a little further

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
with that too, because I think
it's always very interesting.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.396 align:middle line:10%
So when you have
gratitude for your work

00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:10%
and you help other
people, continue on,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:10%
what does that mean?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It means
that I am grateful that I

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:84%
get to come into contact
with so many people,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that I get to help them in
some way to do something,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that I'm useful, I have a
purpose to get up every day,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and I have a reason
to get out of bed

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and put a smile on my face and
go and make somebody else feel

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There we go.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.380 align:middle line:90%
So, let's go one step further.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So with your job, you're
interacting with other people.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And you said at the very end,
you're making people feel good.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So, when you have this
gratitude attitude or attitude

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude, and
you go to work,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.680 align:middle line:84%
you make people
feel good, can you

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
imagine that you
make them feel good,

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
how they feel about
themselves, then?

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.572 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:39.572 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And then in turn,
they'll turn to a co-worker

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.531 align:middle line:84%
and just feel good
about themselves,

00:07:43.531 --> 00:07:45.196 align:middle line:84%
they'll feel good
about the other person

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and put a bit of positive
energy, if you will.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.701 align:middle line:84%
And then that other person will
put more positive energy out,

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to see that
our attitude is very, very

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
important and that we really do
have a connection to everybody,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:90%
and there is a rippling effect.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So everybody
should know that,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
that your attitude is
really, really important.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine if you didn't
have an attitude of gratitude

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and a positive attitude,
then it was just

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
the opposite, the effect it
would have on people, right?

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Right.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's good.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else have
something different?

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.534 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
my gifts and skills.

00:08:17.534 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: What
does that mean?

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's be more specific.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That means that the
things that I know how to do

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
will allow me to help
others in different ways.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very thankful for the
numbers of gifts and skills

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.081 align:middle line:84%
that I have that I can offer
them as a gift to other people.

00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, good.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.991 align:middle line:84%
Anybody else have
something different?

00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My friends.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your friends.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And why do you have
gratitude for friends?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Because I get to
meet with a group of women

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis,
and they support me.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:90%
We support each other.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:90%
We help solve problems.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It's almost more
important than my family.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.088 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Almost more
important than your family,

00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:90%
interesting, interesting.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.171 align:middle line:84%
So, you have gratitude
for your friends.

00:08:56.171 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So, I think that
people in our lives

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:90%
come together for a reason.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I think a reason, a
season, or a lifetime.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you say gratitude
with friends, I like that.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that people in
your life who are close to you

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
are really, in a way,
reminding you who you are.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So, they have this
component that they

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
remind you of your
own loving self.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You might see an aspect of
yourself you never knew before,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.249 align:middle line:84%
but your friends
point that out to you.

00:09:25.249 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Exactly

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.956 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Exactly.

00:09:26.956 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense to you.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.611 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what's
going on there.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we might find
that, with our friends,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that they'll stay for a
little bit in our lives,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and then they might move on.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We might have some
new friends come in.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.774 align:middle line:84%
And that's only
because we have to find

00:09:40.774 --> 00:09:42.156 align:middle line:90%
other aspects of our being.

00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they were there just
for those secondary moments

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.242 align:middle line:84%
to be there to help us to
understand who we are and see

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:90%
ourselves in a different way.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.314 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:09:50.314 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very nice.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, one more.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.585 align:middle line:90%
Yes, right here.

00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have
gratitude for the lessons

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.385 align:middle line:90%
I learn in difficult times.

00:09:59.385 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Really?

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.794 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:04.043 align:middle line:84%
Because some people would
say, oh, the heck with that.

00:10:04.043 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Difficult times, why does this--
how could God do this to me?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
This sort of an attitude
they would have.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course I have
that first response.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.046 align:middle line:84%
And then when I step
back, it's I never

00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:84%
would have learned
this lesson, I never

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
would have brought
this out, I would never

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.217 align:middle line:84%
have had this compassion if
I hadn't gone through this.

00:10:25.217 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Great.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:90%
So, it's very, very true.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I think we learn a lot from
the adversity in our lives.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.435 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:10:34.435 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I think if we can
just get to the point

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.389 align:middle line:84%
where instead of judging an
experience as good or bad,

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
really just stepping back and
looking at the whole experience

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:90%
as what am I learning from this?

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
What is this teaching
me and teaching others?

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting to
the judgment of it,

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:90%
what lesson am I learning?

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
What is my soul going
through right now?

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's fantastic.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.292 align:middle line:84%
And I think if more people
could start seeing things

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
in their lives that
way, situations

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.504 align:middle line:84%
that they're learning
something from,

00:10:59.504 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
I think that they'd
see themselves

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:84%
in a very different light
and the world around them.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:90%
So, very good.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's important
that-- so we assess ourselves,

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
we assess what's important to
us, what we have gratitude for.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
An attitude of gratitude--
so, so important.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you
really-- other ways

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
you can have gratitude
in your life,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.043 align:middle line:90%
you also can write a letter.

00:11:22.043 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:84%
You can go home
and write a letter

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and just say what you
have gratitude for,

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
or write to some person
in your life and say,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I have gratitude for you
for the various reasons

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
that you taught me.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So I think if you can
really surround yourself

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.170 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of gratitude
and a sense of well-being,

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:90%
it helps you in your life.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier,
we're all magnets.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And around us is an atmosphere,
a beautiful atmosphere

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:90%
called the auric field.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And really, you
are what you think.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you start each day
with a sense of gratitude,

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
thank the universe
I'm here, I appreciate

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
everything, what am I
going to learn today,

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
bless this road that I'm on
today to learn something.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll start
seeing your lives change,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and it'll be very
positive benefits from it,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and the joy that comes into
your life, you'll be like,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
wow, it's joyful, it's
happy, I feel balanced.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.901 align:middle line:84%
I have people around
me who support me.

00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that's very
important to do.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:90%
So, an attitude of gratitude.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:90%
What is this teaching me?

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The short version
of that is, when

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
you're in a
situation-- adversity,

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
difficult situation-- step back,
instead of judgment, and say,

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
what am I learning
from this situation?

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.370 align:middle line:90%
What is this teaching me?

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.249 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:12:29.249 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to do a little
bit of a meditation

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
now with you, if that's
OK, about gratitude.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that all right?

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to have you put
your papers down, if that's OK.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And you at home also
put your papers down.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:90%
Put yourself in a quiet space.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.034 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.034 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It'll be a short meditation.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little bit
of a journey for you,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
just to connect yet
again with your own joy

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and your own happiness and
your own attitude of gratitude.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's, I guess,
more of a prayer I

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.025 align:middle line:90%
would like to say for you.

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:00.025 align:middle line:90%
So just close your eyes.

00:13:00.025 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.177 align:middle line:84%
And just become mindful of the
space that you're sitting in.

00:13:06.177 --> 00:13:07.635 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of
your physical body.

00:13:07.635 --> 00:13:10.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Become aware of the physical
body sitting in the chair,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
your feet on the floor,
backs in the chairs.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The physical body, the head, the
shoulders, the arms, the back,

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the chest, the stomach,
your legs, your feet.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And just for a
moment, in your mind,

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:40.160 align:middle line:84%
have a thought of gratitude, of
thankfulness, of appreciation

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:90%
to the physical body.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
If you will, just
go-- if you imagine,

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
right in your third eye
center, of a beautiful light.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I would just like you
to use your imagination

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
to turn that light
and turn it inside,

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:84%
almost like a flashlight
shining inside the body.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And let that light
illuminate every cell

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
of the body, every
organ, every muscle.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Be mindful of the blood
flowing through the heart,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:84%
pumping through the
heart, nurturing

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:90%
and feeding every single cell.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And as that moves that
way along with that, I

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
want you to send a
thought to the body,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to every cell, every
muscle, every organ,

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and that you
appreciate, you have

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.896 align:middle line:84%
gratitude for everything this
physical body does for you.

00:14:34.896 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
You have gratitude for the
heart pumping the blood

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to nurture every cell,
every muscle, every organ.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You have gratitude to each
organ-- kidneys, liver,

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.420 align:middle line:84%
stomach, the heart-- every
single organ that you have,

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
for allowing you to be
incarnate, for your spirit

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:84%
to use this physical body
to go through school here

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.210 align:middle line:90%
on this earth.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And without yourself being
in perfect health and balance

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.655 align:middle line:84%
and perfect condition,
we couldn't do that.

00:15:13.655 --> 00:15:17.252 align:middle line:84%
So now is the time for
thankfulness and gratitude

00:15:17.252 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:90%
for the physical body.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you send out that thought
of gratitude and appreciation

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
to the physical body,
also be mindful how

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
it makes you feel by
sending out gratitude.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.112 align:middle line:84%
How does it make you
feel within your being?

00:15:34.112 --> 00:15:37.224 align:middle line:84%
Because as we give
out, we receive back.

00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, just take a deep
breath into your heart

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
through the nose and
exhale through the mouth.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And inhale.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And now I'd like you
to imagine that you

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
are part of Mother Earth,
that your energy, your light,

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:84%
your spirit goes way
beyond your feet,

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the Earth.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And please bring gratitude to
Gaia, this lovely Mother Earth,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
for the balance, for the
nurturing, for the energy.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:84%
She sustains us, she
loves us, never asking.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And we as humankind,
many times, abuse her,

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
consciousness or awareness

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
take care of her.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to be responsible
for Mother Earth.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we think there's
an endless supply.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Please now bring
gratitude to Gaia

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and thank her for
giving us this space

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:90%
to have this human school.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.175 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath.

00:16:46.175 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And now in front of you,
with your imagination,

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I would like for you to see
different people in your life

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:90%
right now walk before you.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And as they come
before you, I would

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
like for you to send each
one gratitude, a sense

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
of appreciation, one at
a time, whether they're

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world
or in the discarnate.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
One at a time, let them
come through to you,

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.335 align:middle line:84%
stand in front of you,
and acknowledge them

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:90%
with gratitude.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.678 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.678 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
For as we do that, we receive
something back from them.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.854 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:36.170 align:middle line:84%
It's within our
being that they also

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
have acknowledgement
and gratitude to us.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Listen carefully, if you
can, to what they say to you,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
the gratitude they have
for you, perhaps lessons

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:90%
you've taught them.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
We are so much more
than the physical body.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.185 align:middle line:84%
We go way beyond the human
three-dimensional world.

00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:08.125 align:middle line:84%
This is just a very small
part of who we are as beings.

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends, we've
blessed your meeting here

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Dear spirit friends,
we ask for you

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to come be with us today,
enlighten us, open us

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to your love, to
your understanding.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
We receive the gratitude
and appreciation

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:90%
for sharing this path with you.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And we ask you to do this in
the highest vibration of love.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And take a deep breath.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.862 align:middle line:84%
Then slowly open up
your eyes and be as one.

00:18:41.862 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Namaste, namaste.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that nice?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, isn't that nice?

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It sets it up as a really,
really nice energy.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And you might be able
to feel the energies

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.606 align:middle line:90%
change since we started.

00:18:57.606 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to cry.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, any questions
before we start

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.715 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
the spirit world?

00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
the spirits would

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:84%
like to send some gratitude
through me to you,

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:90%
so I have to do that.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
You're all so there.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.214 align:middle line:90%
Imagine how I feel-- there.

00:19:18.214 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you have
one foot here and one foot

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:90%
way over there.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.487 align:middle line:90%
So, it's really interesting.

00:19:22.487 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:84%
We talk about multi-dimensional,
because we're all

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensional beings.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a gentleman that's
coming into my space.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.324 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand this,
that I touch the spirit

00:19:31.324 --> 00:19:33.710 align:middle line:84%
world on your behalf and I
connect with this gentleman

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.529 align:middle line:84%
here, he feels like
a father figure.

00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And he feels like a father
figure who passed away

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
in his 70s, and I'm
going to get him close.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:84%
He very much wants
to be here tonight.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just get him
very, very clearly

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
wanting to come speak here
and wanting to come through.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So I have to go here
with this gentleman.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
a John connection.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Not sure that's his name, but
it could be someone on the earth

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:90%
or in the spirit.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.778 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure with
that, but that person's

00:19:58.778 --> 00:20:01.440 align:middle line:84%
here, or talking
to me about that.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.761 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to go there.

00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:05.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to go here.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Who has a father
who died in the 70s?

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.320 align:middle line:90%
You do, one, two.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:90%
And you do.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.585 align:middle line:84%
So would you mind standing
up if it makes sense to you,

00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see which one of
you it makes sense more for.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And would either one of
you know a John connection

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:90%
in the spirit world or living?

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You do,
in the spirit world?

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I
think I'm with her.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Kim.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kim.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So Kim, you'd understand about
the gentleman that comes here

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.704 align:middle line:90%
as a father figure for you, yes?

00:20:33.704 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.805 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And the
John connection you

00:20:35.805 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%
would also understand, then?

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would that be
associated with your dad?

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And what
is that connection?

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's his brother.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's
his brother, great.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:90%
So I know I have that in him.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:90%
He's talking about him.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And he's in his 70s when he
passes over, isn't that right?

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know that your dad,

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
when he comes close
to me, I've got

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that I
like this gentleman.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I like him.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.990 align:middle line:84%
A little bit more
serious than I'm used to,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:90%
but I've got to say.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And was there a
Midwestern connection

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.274 align:middle line:84%
with your father
originally, please?

00:21:00.274 --> 00:21:02.857 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if someone in your
family was going to buy a farm

00:21:02.857 --> 00:21:04.804 align:middle line:84%
or looking to get more
land just recently.

00:21:04.804 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.104 align:middle line:90%
What is--

00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Well,
I have a brother

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.380 align:middle line:84%
who has a ranch in
Eastern Colorado.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.777 align:middle line:84%
And I have another brother
who had a farm in Kansas.

00:21:13.777 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There we go.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So I know what I'm
hearing in my head.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.972 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the two
of them have the same name.

00:21:19.972 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: John.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: John.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's the John.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My brother is John.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
your brother is John.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: And my
father's brother is John.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK,
I knew there was

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
a connection with
the name here, John.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.396 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:21:28.396 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.835 align:middle line:84%
So, I know that
your father wants

00:21:31.835 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to talk to me about the
boy that has the farm.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he's been
around him quite a bit.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.734 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's been
changes around that farm.

00:21:39.734 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't think he shares
a lot with the family.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But I know there's been stuff
going on around that farm area.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.335 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you understand.

00:21:45.335 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Very, yeah.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.142 align:middle line:84%
So I know that your daddy really
is trying to take care of him.

00:21:51.142 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
know there's been--

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.114 align:middle line:84%
he's talking to
me about problems

00:21:55.114 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
with the loan problems
and money problems

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.103 align:middle line:84%
and getting some money for
something for that farm,

00:21:59.103 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:90%
do you understand that?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.046 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank
you very much.

00:22:02.046 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very
aware that your daddy

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
wants me to tell you to tell
him that things will get better

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.145 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:22:09.145 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Does
that make sense?

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It makes
very much sense.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Very much sense.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.566 align:middle line:84%
I thought so, because
that's what I'm hearing.

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know that he--
I hear you, go on.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:84%
He watches him all the
time at that farm area.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:90%
He watches him all the time.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
I know that he's in one area
and he takes his boots off,

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and he scrapes off his boots.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.962 align:middle line:84%
And he's in, like--
I don't know if it's

00:22:26.962 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84%
a mud room or something, but
he's scraping off his boots,

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.583 align:middle line:90%
and that's what he's showing me.

00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.093 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he
has a flannel shirt on.

00:22:33.093 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:90%
He shows me a flannel shirt.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:84%
He said your brother likes
to wear flannel shirts,

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and there's a red flannel
shirt he had on the other day.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And you ask him about-- I
don't know if he has a tractor

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:90%
or there's a tractor there.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
father shows me there's

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
a separate area where
they keep the farm

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
equipment or the
tractors, and I know

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
it's in a separate
kind of area, a room

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.794 align:middle line:84%
or, I mean, a big space
there with corrugated metal

00:22:55.794 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the building.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:90%
It's this sort of a thing.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.626 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:22:59.626 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know there'd be
three tractors there.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.305 align:middle line:90%
Three tractors.

00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Because he shows me
three tractors there.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.125 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's
been some people that

00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:84%
have been stealing money
from him that work with him.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm very aware of that.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to find
that out, because I

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.963 align:middle line:84%
know that there would be
certain maintenance people that

00:23:13.963 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:90%
work there.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.219 align:middle line:84%
And the maintenance people work
in that corrugated building.

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, I'll
have to ask him.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You'll
have to find out.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:90%
There's been two people there.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:90%
So be careful.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Dad says, tell him that two
people there he doesn't trust.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.305 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like they
work in that place

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:29.725 align:middle line:84%
where the tractors are,
the corrugated metal place.

00:23:29.725 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's talking
about your mom.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.349 align:middle line:90%
Is she still living down here?

00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.855 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I want to
let your mother know I'm alive,

00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and tell you mother I'm
very, very happy where I am.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on, go on.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.470 align:middle line:84%
He had to change
his glasses soon.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So your brother must
be wearing glasses.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.155 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He has contacts.

00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:49.404 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He has contacts.

00:23:49.404 --> 00:23:50.265 align:middle line:90%
Would you find out?

00:23:50.265 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Your dad says he had to
change them recently.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:90%
So there's been a change in--

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
don't know about that?

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I do
know about that, yes.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: There's
been a change.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The prescription has
been changed there,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.410 align:middle line:84%
he's telling me, that he
just recently happened.

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.826 align:middle line:84%
And I know with
your dad, he can't

00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:90%
breathe before he passes away.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I know the heart and the
lungs are really the problem.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:05.150 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And when he
goes, that's the problem,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.729 align:middle line:90%
he said to me.

00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
He always knew he was
going to go that way.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Always knew it.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Always knew it.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.717 align:middle line:84%
I feel when your
father was very young,

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:84%
he gives me a sense
here-- by the way,

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.424 align:middle line:84%
he's over here with three
people in the family that

00:24:16.424 --> 00:24:17.609 align:middle line:90%
are very significant to him.

00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I know one is the brother John.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's also another person
there, a sister or something,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:90%
who passed over.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: But I
feel like a sister

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.040 align:middle line:90%
that's he's very close with, OK?

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know
she's over here as well.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.377 align:middle line:84%
I know Rose is
somewhere some Rose.

00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:90%
You understand Rose?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's his sister.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:90%
She's still alive.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's his
sister Rose, still alive.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:84%
So there are three
of them all together.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.079 align:middle line:90%
Rose is down here.

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, let Rose know that we look
in on her, would you please?

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I will.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.958 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that as I go back and I
go younger with this gentleman,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if he had to be
older as he was younger.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.267 align:middle line:84%
So he had to grow
up very quickly, OK?

00:24:47.267 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:48.808 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:48.808 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I know that
the family sometime, there

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.696 align:middle line:84%
would've been someone a long,
long time ago who might have

00:24:53.696 --> 00:24:55.147 align:middle line:90%
thought about being a policeman.

00:24:55.147 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I had three
brothers that were.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You had three
brothers that were policemen.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Great, because
he's on about that.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.244 align:middle line:90%
Who's Paul?

00:25:02.244 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's the
street my mom lives on.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh, Paul Street.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Paul Road, yeah.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.493 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Paul Street.

00:25:07.493 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.298 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you, I don't
know if one of the brothers

00:25:11.298 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
was recently visiting her.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.594 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:25:13.594 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because I know
that that just happened,

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.410 align:middle line:90%
he's on about.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:90%
And we are aware of that.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:90%
We are aware of that.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, they all come here,
and you have a grandmother

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and grandfather
on the other side.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:84%
There are two
grandmothers specifically,

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I gotta tell you, that
want to say hello to you.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And a grandfather.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
You might have two
grandfathers over there,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:84%
but I'm only getting
one next to me.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:90%
But I have two grandmothers, OK?

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:90%
And I know that I-- what?

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Go on, slow down.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
There's an M initial here,
like a Margaret or a Mary

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
or someone that comes in.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's lots
of M's in our family.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:40.961 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK, so would
a grandmother have something

00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:84%
to do with an M, like a Margaret
or a Mary initial at all?

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.665 align:middle line:90%
Who's a Margaret?

00:25:46.665 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Margaret is
my mother's grandmother.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
mother's grandmother,

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:84%
who's passed in
the spirit world?

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.616 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:53.751 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Go on.

00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:90%
I know that-- slow down.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So, see if your mom still has
things that belong to her.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She does.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She does.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:00.892 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Because she said, she
still has my things here.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:05.016 align:middle line:84%
And different things, like
utensils, kitchen things.

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She does.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.741 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Kitchen
things she still has.

00:26:07.741 --> 00:26:08.490 align:middle line:90%
And I like that.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Go on, go on, go on.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So would you let your mom know
that she's being looked after,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.675 align:middle line:84%
and your father's
looking after her,

00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:15.966 align:middle line:90%
her mother's looking after her.

00:26:15.966 --> 00:26:18.055 align:middle line:84%
There's a Katharine
somewhere, a Kathy somewhere.

00:26:18.055 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Who's that?

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: That's
another grandmother.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Another grandmother.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:90%
That's the other one.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.149 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Kathy or Katherine.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And over there as well.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
brothers, I need

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:90%
them to talk to each other.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So the three of them are not
always talking with each other.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: There's
eight of them.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
there's eight of them.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Wow, wow.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.419 align:middle line:84%
But there's some of them
not talking to each other.

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:90%
So we need to have that happen.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And your dad's not happy when
they don't talk to each other.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your
father and your mother,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.468 align:middle line:84%
when they were younger, it was
a very, very important thing

00:26:45.468 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
that they had a family
that was connected.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Family was everything to them.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Is.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.746 align:middle line:84%
And I really want you to push
getting together a family

00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:54.370 align:middle line:84%
reunion, because
that's what they want.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK?

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's really important.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.905 align:middle line:84%
And Dad's saying, it's OK no one
was there when I passed away.

00:27:00.905 --> 00:27:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So you must not have
been there when he died,

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:90%
or someone wasn't--

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Not when it-- no,
I was there within an hour,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.970 align:middle line:90%
but not at the time.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Not at the
time he passed, right?

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And you must have
thought about, oh gosh,

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.371 align:middle line:90%
I should have been there.

00:27:10.371 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Why wasn't I there?

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to
tell you it's OK.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:17.033 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.567 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:20.900 align:middle line:90%
You can applaud for the spirits.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.408 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:27:21.408 --> 00:27:23.541 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:23.541 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.629 align:middle line:90%
Not for me, but for them.

00:27:25.629 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:90%
That was very good.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
That was a very-- that
was a very good-- I

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
like that connection
with your family.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Very, very nice.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.604 align:middle line:84%
And tell your mom that he's
around, they're all around.

00:27:36.604 --> 00:27:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: She knows.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.561 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah, good.

00:27:38.561 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
She sits on this
chair and she stares--

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.194 align:middle line:90%
his picture's across from her.

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
They're right across
from her, and she's

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:90%
staring at these pictures.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Say just validation
that they're there, OK?

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have a man here.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.071 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask if there's
a lady in the audience who

00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:53.190 align:middle line:90%
lost her husband?

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Is there somebody who lost
her husband or brother?

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:90%
You lost your brother?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So, may I bring him
through for you?

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:02.822 align:middle line:90%
And what is your name, darling?

00:28:02.822 --> 00:28:03.571 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Rosio.

00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Rosio.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Rosio.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:90%
OK, Rosio.

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Your brother that
passed over I feel

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.020 align:middle line:90%
he's more younger than older.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Can I tell you that?

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:13.453 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh,
yeah, much younger.

00:28:13.453 --> 00:28:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Much younger.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.017 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you
that I passed fast.

00:28:16.017 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I don't pass slow.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't pass like I'm ill.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:90%
I pass very quickly.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I pass unexpectedly.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I want to say some violent
element to this as well.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Do
you understand that?

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.251 align:middle line:84%
Because as I get
your brother, I feel

00:28:28.251 --> 00:28:29.752 align:middle line:84%
there's a violence
around his death,

00:28:29.752 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and he's going on about that.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But he said it
happened so quickly--

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it happened at
the hands of another person.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So as he comes close
to me, I've got

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that I don't like
people that are around him.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell
you, was he shot?

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.626 align:middle line:90%
Go on.

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Because I know I see a gun.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
He gives me the feeling
of a gun and is shot.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.183 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
there's somebody there

00:28:53.183 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
he knew when he was
young boy or younger

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:90%
that was around that passing.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So I know he
would have known the person

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:84%
or people that were there,
because I don't get just one

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:84%
person, but I feel there were
a couple of people there.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:05.495 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I do gotta
tell you, your brother

00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:90%
talks about money, money, money.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.944 align:middle line:84%
The issue of money,
money, money.

00:29:08.944 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.443 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I
think the death happened

00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:90%
because of money, money, money.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.825 align:middle line:90%
I got to tell you that-- go on.

00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Was he inside or just
outside when this happened?

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.105 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I think it was--

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH:
Where was he found?

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.179 align:middle line:90%
Outside?

00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You don't
know where he was found?

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.192 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking it was just outside
his house, but I'm not sure.

00:29:32.192 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The reason why-- the
feeling he gives to me--

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and I don't like to ask
questions, but the reason he

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:84%
gives it to me is
because I'm feeling

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
with these people in an
inner area, in a living room,

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:90%
inside somewhere.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Someone's smoking
cigarettes or joints

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
or something going
on here and doing

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:47.960 align:middle line:90%
drugs and this whole thing.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.344 align:middle line:90%
And there's some money exchange.

00:29:49.344 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
something happens there.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:90%
There's an argument.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:90%
There's a confrontation.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:90%
There's some stuff going on.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know that someone stole
something from someone way

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.636 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:29:58.636 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if they
stole a wallet a while back

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:90%
or stole some money.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But there was something that
belonged to somebody else.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
confrontation about that,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:90%
he's going on about.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I know
about tattoos, by the way.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:09.335 align:middle line:90%
I have tattoos.

00:30:09.335 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So your brother must have had
tattoos on both arms here.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I just know that.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling covered
with tattoos.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.454 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very aware--
he knows these people, boy.

00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:90%
He knows these people.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I feel men.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.994 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
someone shows a gun.

00:30:21.994 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there are two
guns-- not only one gun,

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:84%
but someone else
owns a gun as well.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:26.644 align:middle line:90%
So I know there are two guns.

00:30:26.644 --> 00:30:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I know that he must have went to
school with one of these people

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And I very much am aware,
as he comes close to me,

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that there was
some confrontation

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
inside of the house.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But I know someone goes outside
of the house or he tries

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
to get away or something,
and they shoot him

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.100 align:middle line:84%
outside, or someone's
shot outside.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:90%
He's gotten outside.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I almost feel like
I'm either on a sidewalk

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:90%
or at the staircase.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.404 align:middle line:84%
And I'm right there in the
front lawn or the cement.

00:30:53.404 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.780 align:middle line:90%
But I know it starts inside.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a threat,
and there's money.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And I know that.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I also am very,
very aware there's

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.350 align:middle line:84%
a girl that hangs
out with all of them.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.110 align:middle line:90%
There's a girl.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And would you know if there's
someone named Robert anywhere?

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I have-- I
refer to him as my cousin,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.190 align:middle line:90%
but he's my godparents' son.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Roberto.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Would he have
known about your brother

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:90%
and about any people around him?

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
he knows a lot more.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
he knows a lot more.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And is there a man
in jail right now?

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.454 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:27.454 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: One man?

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:29.986 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Should be two.

00:31:29.986 --> 00:31:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Should be two.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Should be two.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.604 align:middle line:84%
I think he must have
been shot three times.

00:31:35.604 --> 00:31:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I don't
know how many times.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Three times.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.910 align:middle line:90%
I gotta tell you that.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I know he shows me a
nine millimeter gun.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:90%
So find out, nine millimeter.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.210 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I know that your
brother says to me,

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:90%
he's all right where he's at.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:84%
He thanks you for
being here today.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.940 align:middle line:84%
But not only here today, but
every day you think of him.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And he said,
you put the picture of him,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.290 align:middle line:90%
right, the picture.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
necessarily in a frame.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a regular
picture just put up.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I know if you'll go above
a dresser or a table,

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.170 align:middle line:90%
there's a picture of him.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I know you have a shrine or
some kind of a little altar

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:84%
or something as well, a Virgin
Mary somewhere, a candle.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:12.864 align:middle line:90%
I have a candle lit.

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:90%
In the basement.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In the basement.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:15.870 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it almost feels
like an altar or a shrine.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Is his father in
the spirit world?

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because
I know he's with him.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.955 align:middle line:90%
You have two different fathers?

00:32:24.955 --> 00:32:26.434 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: No,
we have one, but--

00:32:26.434 --> 00:32:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
have one father?

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:28.558 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:28.558 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:90%
He left us when we were little.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: [MUMBLING].

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.705 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Not
crazy about this man.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I'm not judging
it, but I'm just saying,

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.792 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel he comes through
with-- like he should've been,

00:32:41.792 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:84%
like he really could have
been the best father.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.350 align:middle line:90%
I just get a sense that--

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He wasn't.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: --there's
a sense of regret.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But I gotta tell you
something, sweetheart, I still

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.052 align:middle line:84%
feel with the father, I feel
a little cocky with him.

00:32:52.052 --> 00:32:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like he's
learned his lessons since he's

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
passed over to the
other side of life.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel he's
in a space where

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.310 align:middle line:84%
he wants to open up
and learn even more.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
He feels a bit stubborn,
and this is what's happened.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I'm at.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't want anybody
to tell him what to do.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:90%
This is your dad, OK?

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.120 align:middle line:90%
I just don't trust him.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't trust the man.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, me neither.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You don't either.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:14.468 align:middle line:84%
And I know you must have
two other siblings, like two

00:33:14.468 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
other girls in the family,
or three other girls.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: It's
my sister and I.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Your
sister and you.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a grandmother
who wants to give love

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to all of you, to both
of you, three of you.

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.064 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:25.647 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Grandmother
for me or my--

00:33:25.647 --> 00:33:27.857 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I think
she spoke espanol.

00:33:27.857 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That will be my mom.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.239 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have both
my mom and grandma.

00:33:31.239 --> 00:33:32.655 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: In
the spirit world?

00:33:32.655 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Ah, OK.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So I know this lady
speaks Spanish to me,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and I know that she had a hard
life bringing the kids up.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So it
must be your mom.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:90%
It must be your mom.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Must be your mom.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.225 align:middle line:84%
She made some clothes, she
made things for family.

00:33:42.225 --> 00:33:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's it.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know you still
have the clothes.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
All my girls had to
share the clothes.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:84%
She talks about
sharing the clothes.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And we went through boxes.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.112 align:middle line:84%
On the weekends, we'd
go and find clothing.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.570 align:middle line:84%
On the weekends,
you must have been

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.445 align:middle line:84%
going someplace to find
clothing in a church,

00:33:54.445 --> 00:33:56.710 align:middle line:84%
or something about
finding some clothes,

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:90%
she's talking to me about.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:59.631 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She
probably is referring

00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to her washing clothes
for other people.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.166 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: On the weekends?

00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: To make money.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Ah,
on the weekends, OK.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And I know, collect the clothes,
and the kids would help me.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.353 align:middle line:84%
The three girls would
help me and we'd

00:34:08.353 --> 00:34:10.384 align:middle line:84%
go through these clothes,
and we would do that.

00:34:10.384 --> 00:34:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And she's referring to that.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling
me-- I love your mom.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:15.190 align:middle line:90%
Love her.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:90%
She's great.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I love her.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.755 align:middle line:84%
She's like here,
and your dad's here.

00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Seriously.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.426 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Way below.

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm not on
the same level at all.

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just know
that your mother is

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:84%
very grateful for
having you in her life.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And the kids.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And your brother's
fine, she said.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.719 align:middle line:90%
He's learning a lot.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.297 align:middle line:84%
And she said, he
takes responsibility

00:34:32.297 --> 00:34:33.880 align:middle line:84%
for putting himself
in that situation.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.679 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: With
those people around him.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:90%
And he's working on forgiveness.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
He died a little
angry, your brother.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:90%
He was angry, you know?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And I feel with
your brother, he's

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.142 align:middle line:84%
still working on the
relationship with his dad.

00:34:49.142 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I got to tell
you, there was some anger

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:52.520 align:middle line:90%
that he had with his father.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.462 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel
that anger subsided

00:34:54.462 --> 00:34:56.170 align:middle line:84%
when he passed to the
other side of life.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel that-- I really feel
that he's still working on that.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And I gotta tell you that
I feel, from your mother

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.870 align:middle line:84%
especially, the
gratitude for you.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And for the other
girls, for the girls.

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.037 align:middle line:90%
Who has the wedding dress?

00:35:09.037 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: My niece
just got married.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: She was there.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Your mom was there, she said.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So there must have been
a prayer for your mom.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I was
departed, but she said, I

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:90%
was right there with that dress.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And she's very particular
about that wedding dress.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.130 align:middle line:84%
She had to make
sure-- your mom had

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.838 align:middle line:84%
to make sure everything
was just perfect.

00:35:23.838 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your niece
must have worn something

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that belonged to your
mother or thought about it.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: She did a
prayer during the mass.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Did
a prayer for her.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.467 align:middle line:84%
She's so full of gratitude
and so appreciative of that.

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So would you please
let her know that?

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes, I will.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.231 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I'm going to
tell you something, my love.

00:35:41.231 --> 00:35:43.690 align:middle line:84%
You're getting out of
all this old stuff.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.480 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it feels
as if-- I believe

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.589 align:middle line:84%
genetics has a big part
on our life experiences.

00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you that you've

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.120 align:middle line:84%
made a really strong stride to
get out of that genetic play,

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving ahead
in a whole different way

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.850 align:middle line:90%
because you believe in yourself.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Are you married
to that man right there?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.041 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I love him.

00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Love him, love him.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Your mother loves him.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.976 align:middle line:84%
Your mother gives him
and really, really a lot.

00:36:05.976 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
He's helped you, and
you've helped him.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But can I say that he's giving
you yourself back to you.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:90%
He recognizes your light.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:90%
He sees who you are.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.662 align:middle line:84%
He empowers you, and
that's really important,

00:36:15.662 --> 00:36:17.870 align:middle line:84%
because you need support in
your life and people that

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.810 align:middle line:84%
support and empower you,
because you were lost.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:90%
And he sees the truth in you.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Your mother, she loves you.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.349 align:middle line:84%
The husband over here, would
you say, did you know her mom?

00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:30.056 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:30.056 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You did.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.027 align:middle line:84%
She loves you very
much, like a son.

00:36:33.027 --> 00:36:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.568 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Loves
you like a son.

00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
taking care of her.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.372 align:middle line:84%
And you don't take
care of all-- everyone,

00:36:39.372 --> 00:36:41.330 align:middle line:84%
but you tend to want to
take care of everybody.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys have a little boy?

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: He's 20.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He's 20.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.305 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if he's
got a car, a new car,

00:36:48.305 --> 00:36:49.846 align:middle line:84%
or there's someone
in a car with him.

00:36:49.846 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: He drove his
Bug-- car back to college

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.160 align:middle line:90%
this summer.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: He drove
a car back to college.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:55.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.200 align:middle line:84%
She was with him in the new
car or driving the car around.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah, he had to
drive alone back to college.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Had to drive
alone back, new car back.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.034 align:middle line:90%
OK, OK.

00:37:03.034 --> 00:37:04.200 align:middle line:90%
She was with him doing that.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And thank you for
your dad, for your family also.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Got to thank you for them.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:90%
They're all here around you.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: So there you go.

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.580 align:middle line:90%
God bless you both.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.049 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you.

00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:16.043 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:16.043 --> 00:37:17.914 align:middle line:90%


00:37:17.914 --> 00:37:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady here if
your mother passed over.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:90%
What is your name?

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: My name is Edie.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Edie, your
mom's passed, correct?

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.293 align:middle line:84%
And Edie, I've just got
to connect with you,

00:37:25.293 --> 00:37:26.709 align:middle line:84%
if that's OK,
because this lady is

00:37:26.709 --> 00:37:28.569 align:middle line:90%
screaming at me to contact you.

00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So let me just go on what
she wants to talk about here,

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.484 align:middle line:84%
because she said to
me, things were not

00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:34.352 align:middle line:84%
the way I wanted
them when I died.

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
she's saying to me.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Things were not finished or
settled before I passed away.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
She left kind of with
unfinished business.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.489 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has something
to do with family members

00:37:44.489 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
or things that she wished,
and they weren't done.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.229 align:middle line:84%
Or words were not said to
various other family members.

00:37:49.229 --> 00:37:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
you have siblings.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.522 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I do.

00:37:51.522 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that they must be
spread out in different cities,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.259 align:middle line:90%
are they?

00:37:57.259 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Because with this lady, she
said they're geographically

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:90%
spread out.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.652 align:middle line:90%
I can't get to all my kids.

00:38:02.652 --> 00:38:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel trouble
with the stomach area here.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.772 align:middle line:84%
So I'm feeling this
area is really bad, OK.

00:38:07.772 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Is that your mother who has this
problem with this area right

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.439 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Because I feel tumors.

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So she must have had
tumors, pancreatic cancer.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.167 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee there were
little tumors around,

00:38:17.167 --> 00:38:18.750 align:middle line:84%
because it feels
here, I'm spreading--

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.930 align:middle line:90%
it spreads around here.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know there must have
been talk about either making

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.947 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a cut
for a tumor early on.

00:38:24.947 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So you'll have to
find out about that.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.196 align:middle line:84%
She must have lived
in a different place

00:38:28.196 --> 00:38:29.407 align:middle line:90%
than where you lived.

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:90%
She did, didn't she?

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.928 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
with your father,

00:38:31.928 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
there gets a sense
of me that I'm not

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.895 align:middle line:84%
aware of what's going on,
like, two days beforehand.

00:38:35.895 --> 00:38:37.391 align:middle line:90%
Or I'm just out of my mind.

00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
he was in a coma,

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:84%
or there was some kind
of-- he lost consciousness.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.816 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of that?

00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Mm-- yes.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes or no?

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.006 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:46.006 --> 00:38:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was on morphine.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yes.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.838 align:middle line:84%
So you are aware that he
was in a kind of coma state.

00:38:49.838 --> 00:38:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Right, good.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your dad
comes with your mother.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:90%
He's over here.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Your mother's right here.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
I'm here helping you.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Don't feel you're alone.

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:00.675 align:middle line:90%
I'm here helping you.

00:39:00.675 --> 00:39:02.074 align:middle line:90%
You felt so alone.

00:39:02.074 --> 00:39:03.740 align:middle line:84%
The past two days,
you felt very lonely.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.296 align:middle line:90%
You felt by yourself.

00:39:05.296 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And you're not by yourself.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.461 align:middle line:90%
We're taking care of you.

00:39:07.461 --> 00:39:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And she wants me
to make sure you

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.720 align:middle line:84%
get that she has still
connections with you.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.070 align:middle line:84%
She's still part of
your life, very much so.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't gone anywhere,
still part of your life, OK?

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you're
afraid to make choices.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Right, got it, Mama.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't be like me.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Don't be like me, who I lived
my life in fear, she said.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.130 align:middle line:84%
She lived a lot of
her life in fear,

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.546 align:middle line:84%
and she worried about what
other people thought about her.

00:39:34.546 --> 00:39:36.926 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't want you
to feel that same way.

00:39:36.926 --> 00:39:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You
understand that?

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: OK.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.132 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there
are people around you who

00:39:40.132 --> 00:39:41.390 align:middle line:84%
are trying to influence
your decisions

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and your choices right
now in your life.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.566 align:middle line:84%
You mother said, do
what's right for you.

00:39:45.566 --> 00:39:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Make sense?

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.571 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I've
got to tell you something.

00:39:49.571 --> 00:39:51.240 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're
married, correct?

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: I want you
to reassess everything.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure your
husband supports you 100%,

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and that you either need
to recharge that marriage,

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.620 align:middle line:84%
make things-- get
it going again.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.135 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:40:02.135 --> 00:40:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.051 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: That's important.

00:40:04.051 --> 00:40:05.369 align:middle line:90%
Is there a family dog you have?

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.035 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Two.

00:40:06.035 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You have two.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Because I know, as your
father comes through here,

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:84%
he said, the last two days
of his life on the earth,

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:12.130 align:middle line:90%
he didn't know anything.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:12.740 align:middle line:90%
He was out of it.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:90%
He was in, like, a coma state.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.710 align:middle line:84%
But he was aware--
he said it was

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.372 align:middle line:84%
a kind of an in
between world with him.

00:40:17.372 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happens in between.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But he said, those dogs still
see me when I come visit you.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The dogs will look up and
they see him, all the time.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I know when they're
watching television,

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.916 align:middle line:84%
you must have had
a big screen TV,

00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:29.507 align:middle line:84%
or is a-- I don't think
it's a football game

00:40:29.507 --> 00:40:32.090 align:middle line:84%
or something that's being shown
here, with this big screen TV.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he walked in
there, and the dogs looked up.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:90%
So they're very, very aware.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:84%
There must be a big couch area,
like a big, big couch area.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like a
lounge and a couch thing

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.920 align:middle line:90%
in a media room of some kind.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the father comes
watching there on the weekend.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Like a Saturday or a Sunday,
there's a game going on,

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and he comes, and he sees them.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Isn't that weird?

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.271 align:middle line:90%
And one more thing.

00:40:55.271 --> 00:40:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind of
a clock that you have?

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Like, a grandfather clock or a
short one on the wall that goes

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:00.850 align:middle line:90%
tick-tick--

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:01.676 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:01.676 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Because your
mom's pointing that out to me.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if that
belonged to them or not,

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.340 align:middle line:90%
but she's there in that area.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.089 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
that's the kitchen area

00:41:09.089 --> 00:41:10.725 align:middle line:84%
that that's in or
in the dining room.

00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:12.106 align:middle line:90%
Where is that located?

00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: It's by the TV.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:14.605 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Oh,
it's by the TV.

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:15.212 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:41:15.212 --> 00:41:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
talking about that.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.315 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention to that clock.

00:41:18.315 --> 00:41:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: We always have.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You always have.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: Can I ask her if
it was her that was ticking it?

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.476 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: It was
her who stopped it.

00:41:24.476 --> 00:41:26.482 align:middle line:84%
She's stopping it or
moving it some way.

00:41:26.482 --> 00:41:27.360 align:middle line:90%
You understand that?

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.264 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:28.264 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.682 align:middle line:90%
For years.

00:41:30.682 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: For
years, for years.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And she's fine.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.360 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Would you know that she's OK?

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.924 align:middle line:90%
She's still alive.

00:41:36.924 --> 00:41:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And I still
argue with your father.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.790 align:middle line:90%
She still argues with your dad.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.529 align:middle line:90%
She's still arguing with him.

00:41:42.529 --> 00:41:43.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what she's saying to me.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:90%
She's arguing with him.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: That's good.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: And
one more thing.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Does someone have horses or
like to buy horses or have

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.236 align:middle line:90%
horses around them?

00:41:49.236 --> 00:41:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I would have
loved to have had a horse.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You always wanted
to have a horse in your life.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.733 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: I always wanted one.

00:41:54.733 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Don't be
surprised in some strange way

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.964 align:middle line:90%
if a horse appears in your life.

00:41:59.964 --> 00:42:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know
how that's going

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:05.350 align:middle line:84%
to manifest, because I know that
your mother and your father--

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.410 align:middle line:84%
your mother really wants
to take care of you.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.049 align:middle line:84%
And your father's like,
OK, we'll make it happen.

00:42:11.049 --> 00:42:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But your mother's talking
to me about that horse.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:14.569 align:middle line:90%
It's a brown horse.

00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you're
going to have a horse.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how it's
going to come to you.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:18.732 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if someone's
going to say would you

00:42:18.732 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:84%
mind taking care of my
horse, and all of a sudden,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.005 align:middle line:90%
you have to have the horse.

00:42:22.005 --> 00:42:24.882 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have
a horse, guarantee it.

00:42:24.882 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like, I wish
I would have had this.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.342 align:middle line:90%
It's a desire you always had.

00:42:28.342 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's
going to be fulfilled.

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you get the
horse, know it's from them.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:33.870 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AUDIENCE: I got
my dog from them.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: You got
your dog from them.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.227 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you're
going to get a horse.

00:42:38.227 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
whole menagerie soon.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:84%
The dog I have was born
on their anniversary.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>VAN PRAAGH: The dog was
born on the anniversary.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.819 align:middle line:90%
And the dog still sees them.

00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:47.444 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:47.444 --> 00:42:48.314 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Yeah.

00:42:48.314 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'll leave you with that.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.100 align:middle line:90%
All right, sweetheart?

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>>AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VAN PRAAGH: Thank you, hon.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.710 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:58.634 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you all
very, very much.

00:42:58.634 --> 00:42:59.550 align:middle line:90%
And thank you at home.

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just want you to take a
moment of your-- every single

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.990 align:middle line:84%
day of your life to really
take the time, maybe

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.920 align:middle line:84%
before you get up in
the morning or as you're

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
going through your day,
just stop for five minutes,

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:14.830 align:middle line:84%
start breathing in, and
really, really have gratitude,

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:84%
have appreciation for what
you're experiencing that day

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:90%
and for all those in our lives.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, life could
be over in a moment.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.242 align:middle line:84%
Spirit people often
say, you know,

00:43:23.242 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to live every day
as if it's your last day.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you have
gratitude for each moment.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:30.720 align:middle line:90%
That's truly living.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.721 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all very much.

00:43:31.721 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:90%
And thank you very much.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Bye bye.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:50.867 align:middle line:90%
