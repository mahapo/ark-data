00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.960 align:middle line:10%
>> An autoimmune disease is
defined as our immune system

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:10%
attacking various
tissues of the body.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream medicine claims
there is no known cause.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed at 14
with rheumatoid arthritis.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.592 align:middle line:84%
This manifested as swelling
and pain in nearly every joint.

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I never quite bought the
theory that my immune system

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:84%
had malfunctioned and
turned against me.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to trust it
knew what it was doing.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But it felt like my
body was on fire.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Our medical system offers
no answers and no hope,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:84%
so you either accept that
this is your new reality

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
or you choose to find a way out.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.130 align:middle line:10%
I grew up immersed in
the beauty of Lake Tahoe

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:10%
and had the
incredible opportunity

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:10%
to spend every moment
possible outside

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:10%
among the natural playground.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:10%
Being active was my identity.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I lived for exploration,
competition,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and all the creative
ways to challenge myself.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.905 align:middle line:84%
But just as I started eighth
grade, things changed.

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:10%
It first started with some
unusual aches and pains,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:10%
but as an active kid,
I thought little of it.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But one morning
at the age of 14,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I woke with swelling
in nearly all my joints

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:90%
and could barely stand.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly everything in front
of me was a daunting challenge.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:10%
The person I knew myself
to be vanished as pain

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:10%
invaded my body.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
After making the rounds
to several doctors,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
rheumatoid arthritis

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and told I would likely
end up in a wheelchair.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.040 align:middle line:84%
They put me on heavy
doses of steroids

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
as well as a medication
derived from gold.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, actual gold.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:10%
This required weekly blood
tests to monitor my organs

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:10%
for toxicity.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Trapped in a body of limitation,
illness became my identity.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.350 align:middle line:10%
It took nearly two years of
suppressing my immune system

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.073 align:middle line:10%
with these chemicals before I
had significant improvement.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
In an autoimmune process,
the body's defenses

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
create inflammation
on various tissues.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:10%
In Crohn's disease,
it's inflammation

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:10%
of the digestive
system, in fibromyalgia

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:10%
it's in the muscles.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:10%
In rheumatoid arthritis,
swelling and pain

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:10%
fill the joints.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the gold
stopped working

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
and I was put on methotrexate, a
powerful immunosuppressant also

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:90%
used as a chemotherapy drug.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.490 align:middle line:84%
It reduced my
inflammation enough

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to achieve partial remission.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So after film school,
I headed to Hollywood.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't long
before the side effects

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.120 align:middle line:84%
compelled me to finally
seek another path.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I dove into research,
determined that there

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
had to be an underlying cause
to this so-called overactive

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.260 align:middle line:90%
immune system.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
One approach that had
extensive research

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
was the theory of infection as
a cause of autoimmune disease.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:84%
A Dr. Thomas Brown
was the pioneer

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:90%
of low dose antibiotic therapy.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:10%
Several books had
documented his approach.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>> This treatment was
announced in 1949.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.160 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Brown cured thousands
of patients, thousands,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:10%
wrote many, many
scientific articles.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
There have been huge
double blind placebo

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
controlled studies with hundreds
and hundreds of patients.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.980 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to bring attention
to the tetracycline protocol

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:10%
because it goes to the
root of the problem

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't just
address the symptoms.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most renowned
physicians to follow up on Dr.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Brown's work is Dr. Franco.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:10%
>> And we did our studies
in rheumatoid arthritis,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.140 align:middle line:10%
we did our studies
in fibromyalgia,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:10%
we did our studies in
chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:10%
and also Gulf War illness.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:10%
We saw that more than
half of the patients

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:10%
had mycoplasma infection
as opposed to less than 5%

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:10%
of the controls.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you give a
treatment and you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
don't follow the patient
and the patient discontinues

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
in six to 12 months,
it won't be effective.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:90%
This is long term treatment.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to
make sure that you

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
do the right thing,
which is to use

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
the appropriate
antibiotic or antibiotics,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the appropriate route, which
could be oral or intravenous

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.190 align:middle line:84%
or a combination of both, and
the nutritional supplements

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:84%
that are helpful to
help the immune system

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and to produce an
anti-inflammatory effect.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Most RE sufferers have what
I call in the book souvenirs

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:90%
of childhood illness.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is if you've had
a history of strep throat,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
bronchitis, pneumonia, they
manifest in later life.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
They stay hidden in the joints
until your immune system is

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional for
whatever reason,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and then they come out to play.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If infection was the cause,
suppressing my immune system

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:90%
wasn't the answer.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I brought my research
into my rheumatologist.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:90%
But he was not interested.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
He wrote me another prescription
and sent me on my way.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Fueled by frustration,
I passed the pharmacy

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and a line of pill
seekers hoping

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
to ignore the truth of
disease a bit longer.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I made my way toward the unknown
determined never to return.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I sought out a naturopathic
doctor who said all

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:10%
the medications had put some
serious mileage on my body.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
It was time for a change.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Without a doubt, this is
my worst knee right here.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
You can also notice
my hands, I just

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:84%
get a random swelling
of certain joints.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:90%
My elbow is another problem.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
As you see, my left elbow
will extend all the way

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
whereas my right elbow
just limited to here.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We began the antibiotic
therapy as well as homeopathic

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.175 align:middle line:84%
and ozone injections
into the joints.

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> First what we're going to do
is more of an anti-inflammatory

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
shot with the
little B12 procaine,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
which is an anesthetic and
a homeopathic medication

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:84%
for anti-inflammatory
properties.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> We also did ultraviolet
blood irradiation,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.502 align:middle line:84%
which can help kill pathogens in
the body and stimulate certain

00:07:07.502 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the immune system.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:10%
>> It's been a while since
we did your hormones,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:10%
your hormone testing.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:10%
Maybe this would be
a good time to retest

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:10%
some your testosterone
levels and thyroid.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> She's missed my
vein a few times.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully she can find one.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:84%
One essential
component was testing

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that would determine the optimal
diet for my metabolic type.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:10%
>> There is about 85 autoimmune
diseases now that have been

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:10%
recognized, and they really
have but one very simple type

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:10%
of thing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.820 align:middle line:10%
It's related very significantly
to gastrointestinal health.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And we know that starts
literally conception,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
during pregnancy,
what the people eat

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
during those first years
that basically formed

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.770 align:middle line:84%
their microbiome or
which is our microflora

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
within our
gastrointestinal tract.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So we often think of
an autoimmune process

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:90%
is something that's gone awry.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It's really not, the immune
system is totally normal.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the-- it's
these triggers that

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
basically feed into it that
keep triggering inflammation.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And we now know
that inflammation

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:84%
is the number one underlying
issue for all disease.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So the concept is when your
immune system is activated,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:10%
it's activated to protect you.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:10%
Rarely is it an immune
system that's gone haywire

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't have any controls .

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what is
it trying to protect you from?

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course it's very
common that some of the foods

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
we eat, if they
don't make us sick,

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle line:84%
if we don't feel stomach pain
or abdominal pains or gas

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
or bloating when
we eat something,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:90%
we think the food's OK for us.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But in the example of
celiac disease for example,

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
for every one person
that has gut symptoms,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:90%
there are eight that don't.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:84%
They have brain symptoms
or they have joint symptoms

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:90%
or they have muscle symptoms.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't have gut symptoms.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
numerous studies

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that no human gets away with
eating wheat without having

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.870 align:middle line:90%
problems in their gut.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Every human gets
intestinal permeability,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:90%
the slang term is leaky gut.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You have a sandwich for lunch,
you tear the lining of the gut.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:90%
But it heals.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:84%
You have pasta for dinner, you
tear the lining of the gut.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:90%
But it heals.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:90%
One day, you don't heal anymore.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Now you tear the
lining of the gut,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
now you get what's called
pathogenic intestinal

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:90%
permeability or the leaky gut.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Now these molecules get
into the bloodstream that

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:84%
aren't supposed to get
into the bloodstream,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
big molecules called
macromolecules.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.400 align:middle line:84%
They get into the
bloodstream, and now you

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:90%
create systemic inflammation.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> While I was improving, I
was encountering others who had

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
been challenged by
autoimmune disease.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I was a fencing instructor
and a competitive helicopter

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:10%
pilot., and so I was attached to
a lot of physical macho things.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I find that my
students are beating me

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and one day I can't
get out of bed.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the VA hospital.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I was there for 10
days, got diagnosed

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.530 align:middle line:84%
at the ninth day with chronic
inflammatory demyelinating

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:90%
polyneuropathy.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is an affliction
where the myelin sheath

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:90%
on the nerves no longer works.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Much like insulation
on copper wiring,

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
the nerves no longer conduct
the electrical impulse

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:90%
to my muscles.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So we tried steroids and I
just put on weight like crazy

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and was sick all the time.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Then I went through just this
huge spectrum of medications.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Just buckets full of medicines
that didn't take or had

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:84%
a terrible result. I was
a journalist in college

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and I love writing, so I
said, well, I can type.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Well the last three
weeks, I can't type.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.955 align:middle line:84%
I'm down to typing
with my index fingers.

00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And changing your
diet, you know,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
everything we did as far
as changing your diet

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
didn't really ever
help any symptoms?

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it just aggravated me.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.500 align:middle line:10%
>> 42 carbs.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:10%
42 grams of sugar, right?

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Rick struggled
with the diet changes.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But he began a variety
of aggressive alternative

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
modalities including
chelation therapy

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:90%
to treat heavy metal toxicity.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:90%
But so far, nothing was working.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
All my joints had
healed significantly.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
The one knee continued
to slow me down.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
My friends were
offering me their advice

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:90%
on healing the joint.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm kind of thinking a large
pepperoni pizza and a six pack

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of Budweiser.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:90%
Would that cure you for a while?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
What if I try it for you?

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Isn't that your diet already?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Close.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:90%
You miss that?

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
You miss going out with your
friends, have some beers,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
have some junk food,
a double cheeseburger?

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
I miss the freedom of being able
to exist in society without all

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:90%
the limits and rules.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
You reach a different
level too where you don't

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:90%
crave those things that often.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:90%
So you miss it once in a while.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But I might know too much
now to actually enjoy living

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:90%
the way that most people live.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not all about
just diet and finding

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
the exact series of
herbs and supplements

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
or the alternative protocol
that's going to help me.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all 50% of it.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.597 align:middle line:90%
I think 50% of it's mental.

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:42.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
determined and driven

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and believe that you
deserve to live healthy

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:90%
that we deserve to be healthy.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.348 align:middle line:84%
We don't deserve
to be miserable.

00:12:49.348 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.762 align:middle line:10%
[RUSTLING]

00:12:57.762 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I love how
optimistic I was.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Because after my initial dive
into alternative medicine

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and detoxification and
the antibiotic protocol,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I did incredibly well
for about a year.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the pain
returned to my knees.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.010 align:middle line:84%
All my other joints were
healed, which was incredible

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and made a huge
difference and it

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
let me know that I had
really achieved something.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But for the next six years,
I had two steps forward

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and two steps back
despite exploring

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
whatever alternative
medicine I could

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and whatever I could afford.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I decided to start a
support group reach out

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and connect with other people
so we could share war stories

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and share insights.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But despite a pretty good sized
group that I gathered together,

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
there was really
only one person that

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:84%
was interested in seeking the
underlying cause of her pain.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And her determination
just re-inspired my own.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I got sick
I was pretty active.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:10%
We lived on a boat,
sailed around the Bahamas

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:10%
for a little over a year,
and traveled extensively.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
both did for work.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm a writer and my
husband is a painter

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:10%
and his paintings are
based on his travels.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:90%
One morning I woke up--

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I had been clutching
the pillow in my sleep,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and I woke up just
gasping in pain.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I had
to pry my fingers open

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:90%
just to get them to move.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:90%
And then a foot started hurting.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, I scheduled
to see a rheumatologist,

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out that
I tested positive.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.260 align:middle line:84%
My rheumatoid
factor was positive.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
He said to me, you
have RA, and you're

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.887 align:middle line:84%
going to need to go
on methotrexate now

00:14:50.887 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to end up in
a wheelchair in six months.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.730 align:middle line:84%
In every appointment
Grant would say,

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.147 align:middle line:84%
is it possible
that something else

00:14:56.147 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
could be wrong with my wife?

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And they would say-- cross
their arms get annoyed at him

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and say like what?

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would say,
well, I don't know.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really seem
to fit the picture.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
All of her blood tests come back
negative except for one test,

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:90%
rheumatoid factor.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.277 align:middle line:84%
I would say, I have muscle
pain, I don't have joint pain.

00:15:13.277 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, well, you
have rheumatoid arthritis.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:90%
So you just settle down.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:90%
You just settle down and take--

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and have your
methotrexate injection

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:90%
and we'll see you in four weeks.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> After several opinions, one
rheumatologist offered another

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, well, I
think you have arthritis,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
but I think you might
have Lyme disease.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Why would you think
I have Lyme disease?

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, I just think
that when a person has--

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:84%
has rheumatoid
arthritis or arthritis,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
there's something
that's driving that.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Lyme is an infection
transmitted by a tick bite

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
through a spirochete bacteria
called Borrelia burgdorferi.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
If not caught
within a few weeks,

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
it can infiltrate
deep into the body,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:90%
causing a chronic disease.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Though there is controversy over
this version of the diagnosis.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Members of the Infectious
Disease Society of America

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:90%
do not believe in chronic Lyme.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:10%
Critics accuse them of
having conflicts of interest

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:10%
as well as trying to
revoke medical licenses

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:10%
of some doctors who
practice ongoing treatment

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:10%
with their patients.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Members of the international
Lyme and associated Diseases

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Society believe the
illness is an epidemic

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and must be treated
aggressively.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Each year, approximately
30,000 cases of Lyme disease

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:90%
are reported to the CDC.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
But they also state
that recent estimates

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:84%
suggest that approximately
300,000 people may

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:84%
get Lyme disease each
year in the United States.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This is twice the
number of those

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:10%
Though doesn't include
any of the millions

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:10%
of autoimmune diseases such as
chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:10%
and rheumatoid
arthritis, which can all

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:10%
mimic the symptoms of Lyme.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> He ran some tests and it
turned out I tested positive.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
big fights began.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The fights with multiple
doctors telling me I

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.680 align:middle line:84%
could not possibly
have Lyme disease.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%
It was so confusing.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:10%
It's like some kind of
weird political mess

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:10%
with Lyme disease.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.450 align:middle line:10%
There's all this kind of
denying that people have it.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And the insurance
companies going crazy.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to pay for
things if a doctor writes

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Lyme disease on a--

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:10%
It's a real disease.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the great challenges
of it is that it's considered

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:90%
it lives inside the cell.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
for the immune system

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:90%
to be able to attack it.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes a chronic
low level infection.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the very,
very wide variety of symptoms.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, because
there's no really good test

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
to really say whether
you have Lyme disease,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
we use indicators, it's really
more about the patient's

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.587 align:middle line:84%
history and the fact
that you've ruled out

00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
most of the other
types of things that

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:84%
would cause their
symptoms, we have

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
come to this diagnosis
of Lyme disease.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So it is in sort of
epidemic proportion

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.227 align:middle line:90%
at this point in time.

00:17:58.227 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The problem with conventional
medicine is if you don't have

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.883 align:middle line:10%
the acute infection, we're not--
we can't get the diagnosis.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So you might have
had an infection

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
just like you
might have had mono

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.292 align:middle line:84%
or you might have had
some other infection,

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
but that active
phase has long gone.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so your ability to
diagnose that or your ability

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to look at the immune system
and really see that fight

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.720 align:middle line:90%
is over with.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And that lends to the problem of
having the chronic infection is

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that if your body could
have fought it off,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be
having the discussion.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
If you don't resolve
the infection

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.320 align:middle line:84%
or if there is other competing
factors of your immune system

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to not allow you to
resolve the infection,

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:84%
you carry that infection
for a long period of time.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So that leads people all over
the place because at that time

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
you have multisystem
failure, you can't sleep,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:84%
you can't think,
your joints hurt,

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:90%
you have digestive problems.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's not that many
parts in the body that

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
can take a global, we'll
say, insult like that

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and not be affected.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Layne was also exploring
natural healing options,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:84%
one of which was a clinic that
focuses on juicing and using

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
food to detoxify
and heal the body.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They said, we don't care.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if you
have rheumatoid arthritis

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
or you have Lyme disease or
you have Lyme driven arthritis.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you juice
and you're going to be better.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:28.615 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling anxious
definitely and hopeful.

00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I've already made
so many changes

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
in my life to create help and
healing here in the apartment.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:90%
I've got an air purifier.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
I've changed everything
in my bathroom.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe my bathroom
was such a toxic wasteland

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
of synthetic chemicals
and toxic chemicals,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm excited
about the possibility

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
of healing my body completely
pharmaceutical free.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the
pharmaceuticals didn't work,

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:84%
so it'll be great to
try something different.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The juicing clinic was
more than just juicing.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:27.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.305 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm feeling
really overwhelmed.

00:20:30.305 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What we-- we're going
to have some food for you.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.097 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're going to feel a lot
better when you have some food.

00:20:35.097 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:90%
What have we got here?

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We got some-- here it is.

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Here we got it.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my God.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:41.422 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the oatmeal.

00:20:41.422 --> 00:20:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It actually, looks
pretty good, doesn't it?

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, come on.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:49.175 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't.

00:20:49.175 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't do what?

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Juice, juice, the
juice all day long.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.847 align:middle line:84%
13 glasses of fresh
pressed juice a day.

00:20:55.847 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>> You went into the hospital
in a wheelchair and you actually

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:90%
came out two weeks later.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Not at all in a wheelchair.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.065 align:middle line:84%
I came out two
weeks later having

00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:04.268 align:middle line:84%
walked a quarter of a mile
to the beach and back.

00:21:04.268 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
On the very last night, I
walked up and down the stairs

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
backwards to the cheering of
everyone in the dining room.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
incredible the progress

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
that I had had that everyone
had seen me have in just two

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:18.060 align:middle line:84%
short weeks that I
was so much better.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But like many other
wonderful healing protocols,

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:90%
there was a plateau.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
The pain returned after three
months, and little by little,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I ended up back
in the wheelchair.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the one
year mark, I said listen,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:90%
this can't possibly be right?

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't possibly be
in this much pain.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking so many
supplements all day long.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.665 align:middle line:84%
There was so much juice it was
almost impossible to sustain.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I hadn't
been in a restaurant.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.983 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't eaten anything out
of my house in one year.

00:21:43.983 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
fine for me if that's

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.858 align:middle line:84%
going to be a trade off that
I'm going to get better.

00:21:47.858 --> 00:21:50.525 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't getting better,
I was still really sick.

00:21:50.525 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Mario, an actor and acting
instructor from New York was

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with Lyme
disease in 2011.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout my whole life,
there's always been this weird

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
struggle with fatigue.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:90%
But that was my norm.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't really notice it.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:10%
But then once I went to
college and the stress

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:10%
started getting to me, the
fatigue started exacerbating.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And people were kind of
putting that to depression,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
saying I was depressed,
which I wasn't.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I was getting depressed
because I was really tired.

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So we tried a whole slew of
medicines, nothing worked.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:90%
No one would give me answers.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So finally, I went
to one doctor.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
She called me and was
like, I'm so sorry,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.560 align:middle line:84%
but you came back
positive for Lyme disease.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Well I was like, what
are you sorry about?

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.243 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:22:54.243 --> 00:22:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take antibiotics
and I'm going to get better,

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I had no idea
what I was in for.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting in the room today
and I was surrounded by, again,

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
around a lot of very ill
people, both old and young.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And it hit me for the
first time then and there

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:90%
that I have a disease.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was in the
position that they

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:84%
were in because they
were misdiagnosed,

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:90%
they were inadequately tested.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, they're
suffering immensely.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Things have not been good.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been losing more
weight, losing more color.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Every time I hear
of someone else

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:84%
that has passed away through
suicide, it breaks my heart.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
We need the research,
we need the treatment,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
we need this country to admit
that it exists because it's

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:90%
happening all over the place.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:10%
By that time I was taking
an amount of Bactrim

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:10%
that no human being
should be taking

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.740 align:middle line:10%
and I on that for
a really long time.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:10%
And my body just was decaying.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I was literally
turning into nothing.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I
started learning more

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:84%
about natural approaches
and biological medicine.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we all
started to collaborate

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.540 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to get me to
pay for my bills in New York

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and then get me to Switzerland.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> As expected,
Layne kept searching,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and she too discovered the
renowned peristalsis clinic

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.280 align:middle line:90%
in Switzerland.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm hopeful about what's
going to happen in Switzerland.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.150 align:middle line:84%
However, about a
year ago I stopped

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
looking for a cure
which is something

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.293 align:middle line:84%
that I thought would
be instantaneous,

00:24:39.293 --> 00:24:43.125 align:middle line:84%
and started seeing it as a
healing, like a marathon.

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Little prick.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:10%
Ok.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:10%


00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.165 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHING]

00:25:03.165 --> 00:25:04.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Those are the
red blood cells?

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.806 align:middle line:10%


00:25:06.806 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you see that?

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:10%
>> This is something that
we would interpret as either

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:10%
spirochete or parasite.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.242 align:middle line:84%
And we can assume that
this is not the only one.

00:25:17.242 --> 00:25:18.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It was intense
and it was difficult.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Every single day I had an IV.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Most days I had two,
some days I had three.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:84%
That's three different lines
in three different veins

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:90%
on a single day.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's it.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye spirochetes.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
There were days that
I had 20 injections.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:56.085 align:middle line:84%
They do a thing called neural
therapy using homeopathics.

00:25:56.085 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:84%
There were days I
had them in my liver,

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.793 align:middle line:84%
there were days I had them
in my stomach meridian.

00:25:59.793 --> 00:26:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I had injections every
day into my thyroid

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate and jumpstart
the thyroid to start working

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.310 align:middle line:90%
on its own as it should.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I had whole body
hyperthermia, which

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is where they put me into
a small reflective box

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and turned on these
incredibly hot heat lamps

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.930 align:middle line:90%
to induce 103 degree fever.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you feeling?

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Horrible.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's horrible, I need water.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.827 align:middle line:90%
She's bringing some.

00:26:29.827 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:10%
>> They're not looking at,
OK, well you have Lyme,

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.702 align:middle line:10%
let's just try to kill
it with antibiotics.

00:26:33.702 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, why
can't this patient--

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.040 align:middle line:84%
why is it-- what
happened in this body

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that it's not able
to fight Lyme.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:90%
What's blocking?

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.200 align:middle line:90%
What's in the way?

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:90%
What's the toxic load?

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:84%
At the end of my
time in peristalsis,

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm really starting
to feel great.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm very ready to be done.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think I would
be ready but I'm ready.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready and I
really feel strong.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And then as it always does, the
pain begins to creep back in.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here at home
now at post peristalsis

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:90%
following their protocol.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I do an IV every other day.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these
drawers is filled

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
with different
homeopathic bottles

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
with little ampules of different
preparations, things for detox.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
There are 26 of them that
get mixed up into each IV.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:30.663 align:middle line:84%
Grant just put a line into
my vein, right into my arm.

00:27:30.663 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And I did not
breathe the whole time.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:33.813 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you,
that was pretty--

00:27:33.813 --> 00:27:34.730 align:middle line:90%
that was pretty scary.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:10%
But we did it.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> My knees continued to
be my only affected joints.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to a strict diet
and arsenal of supplements,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I tried to replicate my early
success with antibiotic therapy

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:90%
by adding IV antibiotics.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:01.613 align:middle line:84%
I did a daily infusion one
week a month for a year.

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of the problem is
that you get what's called

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
a Herxheimer reaction, which
can be very, very painful.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the organisms
die off in your joints,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:90%
they produce hydrogen peroxide.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Herxheimer is brutal.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like there's a
war going on inside your body.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Many healers will tell you that
this is just a healing crisis

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
to get through it,

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:84%
and you'll feel better
on the other side.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But some of them
are just unbearable,

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and they go on for
weeks, if not months.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to the generosity
of friends and family,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Mario was also headed
to Switzerland.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The next thing I knew,
my parents were taking me

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:90%
in a wheelchair to the airport.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.400 align:middle line:90%
And I was so sick.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
telling my mother,

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what happens.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Get me on the plane.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Just get me on the plane.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It was the first time in my life
since all this stuff happened

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
that I started to
get hope because I

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
started to get answers and I
started to get taken care of.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
That to me was the
beginning of healing.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:10%
I remember Dr. Rao got
my gut ecology test back.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, I don't
know how you're standing.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:84%
He's like, you have such little
bacteria in your GI system

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.298 align:middle line:84%
from the amount of
antibiotics you're using.

00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So you got all the--
a lot of new information.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you feel
when you were done?

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Physically, I did not
feel much, much better.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I did feel a difference,
but I felt a renewed hope.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:84%
But what you're not
told is the ordeal

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that you have to deal with
to get outside medicines

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:90%
into the country.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But you're also dealing
with now information

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.760 align:middle line:84%
that you've gotten
from another country

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.810 align:middle line:84%
that you then have to convince
your medical team here

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that this is the
truth that was found.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So all that optimism
and all that hope

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:84%
started kind of turning
into difficulty.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If like Lyme disease,
infection is also one

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:84%
of the major triggers
for autoimmune disease,

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:84%
what is preventing us from
just fighting it off the way

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.000 align:middle line:90%
our body is designed to?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Nowadays, if we were to look
back and we say how much more

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.133 align:middle line:84%
stress is on the body now
than it was even 50 years ago.

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, how much
have we changed

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.700 align:middle line:84%
food, how much is
electromagnetic radiation come

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.200 align:middle line:84%
in, how many more
hours do people work,

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:84%
how many less hours
do people sleep.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.072 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have all
these things, and I

00:30:46.072 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
don't know that it's such
a head scratcher that we're

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.905 align:middle line:84%
sitting here and
saying, wow, we really

00:30:49.905 --> 00:30:52.248 align:middle line:84%
haven't adapted to this
environment as well.

00:30:52.248 --> 00:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Now the people that
take care of themselves

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:84%
have the best chance to
remain as healthy as they can.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.375 align:middle line:84%
But this is not something that
we can be passive with anymore.

00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, people need to
be active with their health

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:84%
because we know what's
coming around the corner.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.725 align:middle line:84%
Sooner or later, you're
going to break down.

00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The Environmental Working
Group published a study that

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.880 align:middle line:10%
showed over 200 chemicals
and some studies now say 250

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.350 align:middle line:10%
chemicals in the umbilical cord
blood of babies at birth that

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:10%
aren't supposed
to be in the body.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And many of them
are neurotoxins.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It's accumulative
the amount of damage

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:84%
we're getting from EMF, from
the toxicity in GMO foods,

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:35.230 align:middle line:84%
from the preservatives in foods,
from the food sensitivities

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that we might have, from the
phthalates in nail polish

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:90%
that you put on.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.130 align:middle line:84%
When you're exposed
to toxic chemicals

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and they get in your
bloodstream, some

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of these chemicals whether
they are heavy metals,

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:84%
or they're the phthalates, the
plasticizers or the parabens,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.540 align:middle line:84%
these chemicals can
stick to your tissue.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They can stick to
proteins in your tissue.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Now you've formed
a new molecule,

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.170 align:middle line:90%
it's called a neoepitope.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And you make an antibody
that attacks that neoepitope.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:84%
When you attack
that neoepitope, you

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.410 align:middle line:84%
destroy that molecule
of the chemical,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.470 align:middle line:84%
but you also destroy the
tissue that it's bound to.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that should be
incentive for us all to clean

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.885 align:middle line:84%
up as much of our
body burden as we can.

00:32:19.885 --> 00:32:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.790 align:middle line:84%
There is a movement against
the toxic food and chemicals

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that have made their
way into our lives.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And once people are
informed, they have a choice.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, things
like organic and free range

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and non-GMO and
gluten free become

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.400 align:middle line:84%
new expectations as
society has on the food

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%
that we have access to.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And that has a direct
economic impact,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and companies have
to respond to that.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So we the people have to
just have higher expectations

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.920 align:middle line:84%
about what we allow into the
marketplace and what we buy.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.827 align:middle line:84%
Because if there's
no money in it,

00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:19.160 align:middle line:90%
they're not going to produce it.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Through a roller coaster
of progress and setbacks,

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Layne had spent a year dedicated
to her regimen of homeopathics

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and IV therapies, though was
still spending a lot of time

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.290 align:middle line:84%
in a wheelchair smiling
through the pain.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, she had found
a biological medicine

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:84%
clinic similar to Switzerland
now in the United States.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Biological medicine looks
at really how the body works.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:10%
It looks at the physiology
and the biochemistry

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.820 align:middle line:10%
of what's going on internally.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.965 align:middle line:10%
And so when we practice in our
clinic biological medicine,

00:33:56.965 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:10%
what we're mostly looking
for is not you have pain,

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.355 align:middle line:10%
you have a name of disease.

00:34:02.355 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we really
don't treat diseases.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Biological medicine is
not about the disease,

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.340 align:middle line:90%
it's about the individual.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.110 align:middle line:84%
In this clinic, what
we find generally

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:84%
any patient with
a chronic illness

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.370 align:middle line:84%
will say has almost always got a
minimum of five different organ

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.332 align:middle line:90%
systems that are out of balance.

00:34:18.332 --> 00:34:19.790 align:middle line:84%
It could be their
digestive system,

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.650 align:middle line:84%
it could be their
endocrine system,

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.422 align:middle line:84%
is nearly always the
lymphatic system.

00:34:23.422 --> 00:34:25.880 align:middle line:10%
>> When we have organs and
every organ is going to go under

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.047 align:middle line:10%
a certain amount of work
at certain periods of time,

00:34:28.047 --> 00:34:30.469 align:middle line:10%
whether that's stress or
whether that's poor nutrition,

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.270 align:middle line:10%
or whether that's toxicity
from the environment.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But those organs are
still going to do the job.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we're just not
capable to do all those jobs

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.719 align:middle line:84%
And so the doctor's job
in biological medicine

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:84%
is to assess which
part of that--

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
will say which part
of that program

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:84%
isn't being correctly
executed by the patient

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and then to use the therapies
to help the patient do that.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I've been having
to do some soul searching

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and if this doesn't
work, whatever this is,

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that this new wizard is going
to do, if this doesn't work,

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know what else
I'm supposed to do after that.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.810 align:middle line:90%
