>> Mario and I headed back to
the BioMed Center in Arizona

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:90%
for another week of treatments.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the main things that
I've learned in this decade

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
or more is that in order
for any healing to happen,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
the subject that needs that
healing needs the energy

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
for the healing to actually take
place because detoxification,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I've learned this the hard way,
and I don't know if you have.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
But detoxification unless
you have the reserve

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to handle detoxification
that can literally

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
destroy everything
because my body

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the physical
stamina to even keep up

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
with getting those toxins
out and the overburdening

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:90%
of the organs of elimination--

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, because your body
stores those toxins in places

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.800 align:middle line:90%
for a reason.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you ultimately--
it wants to get those out

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%
eventually on its own terms.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you force it
through different means,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
it can not only overwhelm a
normal person, but somebody

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.607 align:middle line:84%
who's got chronic
illness that could,

00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:84%
like you said, you're not
going to have the energy

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.405 align:middle line:84%
to actually facilitate
that process,

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:39.405 align:middle line:90%
and then you just crash.

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, I'm not feeling great,
and I think one of the things

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
about this process is you don't
know what you're going to get.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like you
literally experience

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
almost every symptom in the
textbook of symptomology.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I feel like
someone is squeezing my brain

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
like there's a vise,
and yet it also

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
feels like it's inflamed, like
I can feel it against my skull.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And it really creates kind of
inexplicable depression, which

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I do my best to try to
hide to kind of function

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
in a world that doesn't
really allow for that.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
There's only so many times
that you can let someone

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
into the experience and it not
be accepted until you finally

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
just say I can't let
anyone into this anymore.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm in this on my own.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a little
interesting for you.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:84%
These are the lymphatic,
but they're much better

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:90%
than they used to be.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So this value at 2.5 is
actually considered normal.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I would love to see your
lymphatic a little cleaner.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The lymphatic system
is a different version

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:10%
of your circulatory system.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
People are familiar
with blood circulating

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:90%
in your veins and arteries.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
There's about four
pints of blood.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:84%
However, your lymphatic system
also goes throughout your body,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's about
three or four times

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
more fluid in your
lymph system than there

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:90%
is in your circulatory system.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
How we move the
lymph is movement.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem is when people
are in a chronic situation,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, that lymphatic
system hasn't been breathing

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
or moving for years.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's like moving concrete,
and the difficult thing

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:84%
is there's no real
medication, and there's

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:84%
no specialist that's designated
to look at the lymphatic system

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to recognize whether it's
functioning correctly or not.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Anytime somebody brings
up the word cleansing

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
or detoxification, one
of the main systems

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to affect
is that lymphatic system.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Supplementation doesn't really
do a good job with that.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So you need to use manual
or technological advances

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to move that lymphatic system.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a contagious energy
that comes from doctors who not

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:84%
only believe in the patient's
power to heal but who also

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
understand that our so-called
health care system is broken,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
and they have a role in
redefining what a doctor can

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess the hardest thing
is when you guys are looking,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and you can't find something,
then medicine is supposed

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to look and find
something for you.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:90%
That's industry.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:90%
There's a problem.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Industry addresses a problem.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.123 align:middle line:90%
Industry finds a solution.

00:04:57.123 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I went
to medical school,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:84%
it was really
frustrating because I

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't see a single solution.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:10%
I never expected us to still
be having the conversation

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:10%
about Tylenol, prednisone.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Like everybody
understands, when you're

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
doing medications
like that, you're

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:90%
not addressing the problem.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:90%
We'll all agree on that.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.978 align:middle line:84%
Even medicine agrees
on that, but I

00:05:17.978 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
don't care what the problem is.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.562 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to go ahead
and suppress these symptoms,

00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and then the second
part of the story

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is everybody agrees that the
medication or the treatment

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.000 align:middle line:90%
is going to come with a price.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I think skepticism
is good to a point as long as it

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
leads you to investigation,
but if it leads you to lazy

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:90%
thinking, that's the problem.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And the skepticism that
we are having today

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:90%
is about lazy thinking.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to unlearn
what they've already learned.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that you and
biological medicine doctors are

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.107 align:middle line:84%
the definition of a real
doctor, someone who's not just

00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
a middleman for the
pharmaceutical companies

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and who really wants to
understand the patient,

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.133 align:middle line:84%
but also teach the patient
how to be empowered,

00:06:01.133 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:84%
how to take care of yourself
so that we don't have to keep

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
coming back.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> A goal of biological medicine
is to get the body to use

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
the extra power from the
treatments to do its own work.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:10%
This time my body ignited a
three-day fever, exactly what

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:10%
the doctors wanted to achieve.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
This was another
major turning point.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
As over the next month, the
inflammation in my knees

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.065 align:middle line:84%
was gone, and my strength
continued to improve.

00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
While nutrition may not
always be everything

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
we need for healing, it's
the essential foundation,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:84%
even though most
mainstream physicians

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
have no training in the
effect of diet on the body

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
or understand our microbiome.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>> There are many different
components to the microbiome,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:10%
thousands of different
species of bacteria.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's the symphony
that whole environment

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:10%
plays in your gut in terms
of how your gut functions.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So the information
that we can get

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
from the testing
of the microbiome

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:90%
is very useful, very useful.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But as I talk to
my friends who are

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
world leaders in this
field, the consensus

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
is what's really
safe to say and is

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
going to help the most
people is that the goal is

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
to have a diversity
to your microbiome,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.610 align:middle line:84%
have a whole lot of
the good bacteria

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:84%
there many, many
different types.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And how do you do that?

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
How do you build up the
diversity of the microbiome

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:90%
with beneficial bacteria?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It's what you feed
the microbiome that

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:90%
changes in 24 hours.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of your microbiome
is neither good nor bad.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:10%
So then it becomes it depends,
and so what does it depend on?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It depends on what you eat.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what environment
you expose your microbes to.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It depends on what
you do, and then

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
your microbes that can be either
good or bad for you can turn

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and be good for you and
work to your advantage

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:90%
if you give them something good.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I did a microbiome test
to help determine if my food

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
choices were really
optimal for me.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It provided dozens of scores on
digestive efficiency and food

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:90%
recommendations.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as microbiome
goes that we could test from

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
your sample, it looks like
your inflammatory activity is

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
on the good side, so
that's really reassuring.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:10%
Your gut lining
doesn't look like it's

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:10%
in distress or experiencing
some threat from what

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:10%
we can measure, but there
may be specific smaller kind

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:10%
of molecular pathways
that we score

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:10%
that may be somewhat of a hint.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So like LPS biosynthesis
is something

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
that you have more active
in terms of our gene

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
expression that goes into
pathway activity assessment.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
You have it more active
than our average customer

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:90%
base, our reference population.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So one score being off it's not
something to get alarmed about,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
but having said that,
lipopolysaccharide

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
is something that is known
as an immune trigger.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So we can't fully assess the
state of your gut lining,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.900 align:middle line:84%
but if it is somewhat
permeable and this LPS molecule

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
from your microbiome actually
crosses through the gut

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.700 align:middle line:84%
lining to your blood to
your circulatory system,

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
then it can instigate
some things.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So it puts your immune
system on alert,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
or it can even alarm
it a little bit,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.250 align:middle line:84%
or just a low-grade inflammation
may happen as a result of it.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you have this
Veillonella dispar,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.210 align:middle line:84%
for instance, one of
the microorganisms

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that can produce LPS
lipopolysaccharide,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.132 align:middle line:84%
it's not like you
have to hyper-focus on

00:09:44.132 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that because some
people they look at it,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.930 align:middle line:90%
they start to Google it.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.225 align:middle line:84%
They look at one
culprit organism,

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and they want to do
something about it.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:90%
They run with it to the doctor.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying it's not that much
about that focus on that one

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:90%
guy.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
It's more about trying to
see how we can balance out

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:84%
all of the active
microbes and the functions

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:90%
that they're engaged in.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The balance can be improved
by me improving microbial

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.170 align:middle line:84%
diversity through the
right foods and probiotics,

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and fermented foods, and those
are the action steps I would

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:90%
take.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, I was looking at
your recommendations to see

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:10%
your super foods because
a lot of them are focused

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:10%
on rebalancing your
microbiome and enriching,

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:10%
enhancing your diversity
boosting the richness

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:10%
of the active microbes.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:10%
And so, there are
things like broccoli,

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:10%
which I know you already
eat, and there's bok choy,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:10%
and so a lot of
these are very much

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:10%
filled with good nutrients
and the types of carbohydrates

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:10%
that are known as
resistant starches.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And those things are really
good for feeding your microbes

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and stimulating them to produce
some beneficial nutrients

00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:00.168 align:middle line:84%
for your gut and support your
health and wellness overall.

00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> While I've been on a
30-year journey with autoimmune

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
disease, I have been fortunate
that it hasn't been as hard

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
on me as it has on
millions of others.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was diagnosed, this
was a long time ago, 1968,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:90%
I was on aspirin.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I was taking four aspirin
every four hours, 16 to 20

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
a day, for 10 years of
my life from 4 until 14.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.620 align:middle line:84%
The elbows were the first to
fail all the way to replacement

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:90%
within a short window of time.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, my ankle has been
bad ever since I was young.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they've been
in pain for decades.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
But I would always go out and
do stuff, play sports, and then

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:84%
the next day I couldn't
walk basically.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> David has had rheumatoid
arthritis for nearly 50 years.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And despite a life of multiple
joint replacements and 20

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
surgeries, he still
works as an engineer.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Though recently was
hospitalized for an infection

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
caused by immune suppression
from the medications.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I just forgot about
the severity of the risk

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of infection, like what happens
when you do get infection,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and then I hit in January of
this year that I ended up with

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the infection in the
left arm and left elbow,

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and that turned my
world upside down.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:10%
The surgeon, the
orthopedic doctor,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:30.150 align:middle line:10%
basically said this is bad, and
I didn't know what exactly they

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:10%
were going to do.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell me, but
I came out of the surgery

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:90%
without an elbow.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
They removed the
joint replacement.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:10%
I basically came
to the conclusion

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:10%
I was a defective
person, like I'm just not

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:10%
a full person, a whole person.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I was 38, I think,
and I finally found

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:90%
people that had arthritis.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
First time I could be
around other people that

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
had rheumatoid or had
arthritis and have

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%
discussions and conversations.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:10%
And you know, then
you start to realize

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:10%
your anger is not abnormal.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:10%
It's normal.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:10%
I never had trouble before when
I had my elbow joint reaching

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:10%
for things and picking them up.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So three of these are
supplements, and one of them

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.145 align:middle line:90%
is an actual pharmaceutical.

00:13:27.145 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer taking biologics.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You're never going to go
that root again just because

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of the risk because this
is the second time I've

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
been put in a hospital
for an infection

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
from literally after
almost within a year

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
after I started
taking biologics.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I am about to figure
out a way to control

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the disease without the
biologics that are out

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:90%
there that everybody is doing.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever tried fasting
or like doing a juice fast

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:84%
for, say, two weeks and just
see if what that does for you?

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I have not.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So what my biggest
challenge is I

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't grow up cooking
or even enjoying cooking.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Basically, food for me
was just a necessity,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:90%
not something I enjoyed.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:84%
If it's something I
got to work at and make

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:26.897 align:middle line:84%
all this effort to do, I just
can't motivate myself to do it.

00:14:26.897 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it has to be made easy.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can't.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I went through that.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I tried an aggressive
juicing protocol,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and I could hardly be
on my legs long enough

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to chop up however
many fucking vegetables

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.485 align:middle line:84%
it took to fill
the thing, and then

00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the kitchen was
a disaster, and I

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
was like I can't do this,
like I can't even stand up,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.682 align:middle line:90%
let alone do this.

00:14:44.682 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I mean you
can do it at the store.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.265 align:middle line:84%
Now you can get--
you go to Whole Foods

00:14:48.265 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:84%
and get juices for the week, and
that does make it a lot easier.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I've looked at that paleo
stuff where you can just order

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
your meals for the month.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:90%
That's something I could do.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.756 align:middle line:84%
So right now, I'm
just kind of in a--

00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what you'd call it.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a transition from
what happened last year.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, where is most of your
pain when on a day like today

00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:13.668 align:middle line:90%
is pretty rough?

00:15:13.668 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Where do you feel it?

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, today is--

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:90%
well, the kind of it's weird.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had surgeries to
remove that thumb joint,

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
but I actually have
pain in that area.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no joint there,
so it's kind of funny,

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
you know, top of
my hands, my feet,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
even though I had an
ankle replacement.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So just all over the
foot today, painful.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>> David continues to volunteer
his time for community causes

with the multiple
types of arthritis.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My worldly experience and
maybe even spiritual experience

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
is that when I speak about
my condition from the heart

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in a vulnerable space, I feel
people really connecting to me.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I feel like if everybody really
knew each other's stories,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
we would not be seeing all the
hatred and vitriol and just

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:90%
the things you see every day.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:10%
>> You know those chains that
you use to lock up a parking

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:10%
lot if you wrap that around your
body that whole feeling of this

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:10%
or like feeling like you ran a
marathon without ever running

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:10%
a marathon, and you're
like, how is this possible?

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So I keep searching
for whatever is

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
impeding on creating vitality in
my life and energy production.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> One invisible obstacle to our
health is the electromagnetic

the introduction

has many scientists and
activists speaking out.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:10%
We're experiencing
about 100 million times

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:10%
more the levels of
electromagnetic fields

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:10%
than our grandparents.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Were going from
4G now up into 5G.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
Those are sending signals
that us at frequencies

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:84%
that actually have the ability
to jam our energetic functions

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:90%
the functions in our body.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:84%
And different people
have different levels

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
of sensitivities.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
>> A broad look at the data
shows that while more research

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is needed, disregarding the
disturbing results found

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
in both animal and human studies
could be equivalent to denying

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
the early research of the 1930s
and 40s that smoking caused

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:90%
lung cancer.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until 1964
that the Surgeon General

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
published a report
confirming that connection.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Currently, over 250
scientists in the fields

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:84%
of health research,
engineering, and physics

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.880 align:middle line:84%
have signed a petition
warning about the concerns

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:90%
over EMF exposure.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
An interesting contrast to
the stress put on the body

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
by EMF exposure
is technology that

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
can actually
generate frequencies,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:90%
which optimize our biology.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:90%
Your body is electric.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in medicine,
and we'll say in health,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
we've kind of focused
on biochemistry.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
You see, either
it's pharmaceuticals

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:84%
or supplementation,
but that's not really

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:84%
what your body
generates energy with.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Your body generates
energy with physics.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:90%
So it needs electrical charges.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It needs frequencies.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:90%
It needs these things.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:84%
This biochemistry are
basically catalysts.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
They're sloppy
because that's why

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
we get some effects
and some side effects,

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying that
supplements and pharmaceuticals

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:90%
don't have their place.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but from a
biological system, you can't.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Like vitamin C never
produced energy,

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.865 align:middle line:84%
you know, and a pharmaceutical
never produced energy.

00:18:42.865 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it might
stimulate your system,

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
but it's always a
precursor to get

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:90%
the cells to do something else.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Light therapy or
photobiomodulation is being

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
studied extensively now on
its ability to assist energy

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
production within the
mitochondria of our cells.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Using it intranasally
is also showing promise

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
in treating depression,
improving cognition,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and studies are underway
on its potential

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to treat Alzheimer's disease.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:10%
>> What we are doing is
introducing light not just

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:10%
on the surface
but into the body.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:10%
The Russians first published
the papers in the early 80s

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:10%
to show that if you introduce
light by injecting it

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:10%
into the vein; blood
circulatory system,

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:10%
it improves the
function of the body,

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:10%
endogenous systemically
blood circulation is better.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Issues that involve
the heart gets better.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
If you want to activate cells
that are closer to the surface

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and being exposed to
light, then all you

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
need is shorter
wavelength of red

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.890 align:middle line:84%
if you want to penetrate
deeper you want near-infrared,

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
and there are some other
properties involved as well,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.620 align:middle line:90%
especially for the brain.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Examples of overactive
immune system

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is things like
rheumatoid arthritis.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:84%
For the brain, it is
multiple sclerosis.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.795 align:middle line:84%
So the immune system is
attacking our own cells.

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So that is where we've gone out
of this balance homeostasis.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, if photobiomodulation can
show that it somehow restores

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
or get into the process
of restoring this balance,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
it may be able to help
with the immune system.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But we're investigating what
it's doing for healthy brains,

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:84%
what it's doing
for cognition, what

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:84%
it's doing for
people in meditation,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
we will want to be able
to individualize what

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
is most suitable
for you as a person

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:84%
if you have this condition,
whether it is depression,

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:90%
it is dementia, it is trauma.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to
provide that kind of thing.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So now we are fairly
generic, seem to help people.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.021 align:middle line:84%
In the future, we're going
to see more and more of that.

00:20:57.021 --> 00:20:59.943 align:middle line:90%

>> I feel so strong.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I feel amazing.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone isn't as willing
and dedicated and determined

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
as you are, then we are just
going to continue on this same

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.198 align:middle line:84%
path of going to doctors who
are basically just middlemen

00:21:29.198 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:90%
for the pharmaceutical company.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> My favorite one is
the one who said to me,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
"You're never going
to get better."

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "I don't really
think that that's up to you."

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:10%
>> If she didn't say that; if
she didn't stand up for what

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:10%
that belief was for
herself in that moment,

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:10%
maybe we wouldn't be here, and
she wouldn't be feeling amazing

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:10%
like she does.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.238 align:middle line:84%
We never really looked
at Lyme disease.

00:21:56.238 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
We never really
said, oh, well, we're

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:90%
going to go after spirochetes.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The theory was,
let's boost the-- is,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
let's boost the immune system.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I love that we asked in one
of the very first appointments

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
with Drobot, well,
how am I going to know

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
that I don't have Lyme anymore?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said when you're
climbing mountains,

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to care
if you have Lyme anymore.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:90%
And he's right.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Guess what?

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.106 align:middle line:90%
She's climbing mountains.

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Continued progress compelled
me to test the limits of what

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:90%
my body was still capable of.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that when you
turn off the inflammation

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:90%
and push the body to respond.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
It's natural resilience
and power returns.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I took full advantage.

Woo!

beyond just eliminating illness.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's been a
new level of gratitude

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual strength
to engage the world with.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%

>> I was exposed to concepts of
soul and spirit at a very early

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:10%
age, and I found myself
just fascinated by a lot

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:10%
of the books that I
would find in the house.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.418 align:middle line:10%
I would pick them up
and read about them,

00:24:01.418 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:10%
and they spoke a lot
about this intersection

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:10%
of spirituality and health.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And down to talking
about the nervous

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
system and the
parasympathetic nervous system

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and the sympathetic
nervous system,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.935 align:middle line:84%
you know, all
these monks writing

00:24:13.935 --> 00:24:16.880 align:middle line:84%
about how meditation and
yoga affected these systems,

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and as a young child really, I
found myself wondering, well,

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.018 align:middle line:90%
how do they know that anyway.

00:24:22.018 --> 00:24:23.810 align:middle line:84%
They're saying all
this, and it's obviously

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.852 align:middle line:84%
based on their experience,
but where is the data?

00:24:25.852 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Even as a young person and
the daughter of a scientist,

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I always wondered that.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
What the studies have been
telling us with studies

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
that I've done studies
at other colleagues

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
at major universities
have done, there's

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
such provocative data that
suggesting that these energy

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
healing modalities, if you
want to call them that,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:84%
have these profound effects
on spiritual well-being,

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
physical well-being,
and yet they're

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
hardly being examined in
the scientific field today.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, when we bring
together healers

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that are explaining to
us what that process

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
is, how do they foster healing
in another human being?

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
We begin to ask better and
deeper scientific questions

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:84%
that are really going to
help us to elevate humanity

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.333 align:middle line:90%

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
meditative process powering
up and the benefits of that.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.755 align:middle line:90%
How much detail is essential?

00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:19.400 align:middle line:84%
If I want to get from
A to B, do I just

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:84%
have this vision of B
and trust the details

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:84%
will work themselves
out, or do I

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:84%
need to have the specific
steps along the way?

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I think intention is like
putting out a very specific

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:10%
request to the universe.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:10%
And so, the more
specific, the better.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And I say that also
because looking

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:84%
at studies of intention,
including our own intention

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:84%
experiments, the more specific
somebody's been, the better.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I studied and
interviewed many kinds

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:84%
of different masters
of intention"

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist monks, qigong
masters, master healers.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And while they all had
individual kind of modalities

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and particular practices, they
also had certain commonalities.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And so, I tried to
take those techniques

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and distill them into
a very simple program

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:90%
everybody can follow.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has evolved
though from this is that,

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:84%
in putting people
into groups of eight,

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I have been learning from these
groups like my own little Petri

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:90%
dish.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered that when
people get off of themselves

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and start intending for someone
else, they start healing too.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.410 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a lot of
evidence for why this might be.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
You do something
altruistic, even think

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.110 align:middle line:90%
about something altruistic.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It fires up a whole
element in your body

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that completely changes your
chemistry and your biology.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
You just get into a group
and send a healing intention

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.440 align:middle line:84%
together, and major, major
transformations happen.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
power of connection.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
We have lost that
sense of community,

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and when people come together
for some common purpose,

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.770 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing, amazingly
transformational.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:10.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Most of what we do for our
survival is about cooperation.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.830 align:middle line:10%
That's what our nervous systems
are designed to co-participate

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.830 align:middle line:10%
with another nervous
system through our ability

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:10%
to contact to stay engaged.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.370 align:middle line:84%
It's again, being
able to co-experience

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
safety, of settling,

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:90%
and that's so important.

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:10%
>> This isn't just about symptom
relief and getting rid of that

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:10%
thing that we don't want, but
it's really about a deeper

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:10%
transformation and giving us
access to that innate capacity

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:10%
that we have to really be fully
engaged and enjoy our life.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Whether it's diet,
alternative medicine,

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.357 align:middle line:10%
or optimizing your body.

00:27:48.357 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:10%
It's not just about the illness.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about a lot more than that,
spiritual practice, meditation

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.580 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a very different outlook.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
escaping this.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.885 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're just a
glimmer of what we could be.

00:28:01.885 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:90%
We are rediscovering our power.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Many other cultures
have understood this.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.970 align:middle line:84%
They've used extended human
potential in their lives.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's reacquainting ourselves
with what the ancients have

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
understood for centuries and
then exploring that capacity

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.655 align:middle line:84%
and seeing if we can
extend beyond that.

00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:29.930 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:10%
>> So, how are you feeling now?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.590 align:middle line:10%
>> When you start to experience
gains in the process,

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:10%
you all of a sudden want to
start rebuilding your life

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:10%
really quickly to make up
for everything you've lost

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.630 align:middle line:10%
and everything that you feel
like you've missed out on.

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But when those things
come back, it actually

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.890 align:middle line:84%
exacerbates the
despair sometimes

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.080 align:middle line:84%
because you feel
like you've conquered

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:84%
a huge wall or huge
obstacle, and then you

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.170 align:middle line:84%
see that obstacle
again that you thought

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:90%
you've already conquered.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.190 align:middle line:84%
But there are a couple
of things that I just

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:84%
know in my heart of hearts are
working for me energetically.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The light has definitely helped
a lot with the chronic fatigue,

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.610 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't only
help with the energy.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's helping with
cognition and neurology,

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:90%
putting thoughts together.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely helping
with the brain inflammation.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It's helping with
the depression.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
always told all my doctors is I

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.380 align:middle line:84%
feel like a light's been
turned off in my brain

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:90%
since I got sick.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting that
the thing that's helping that

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:90%
is light.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Does the work you do, the
creative aspect of teaching

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and writing, does that work
as an escape, does that help,

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and does it have a
healing quality for you?

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it has a purpose
for what I've experienced.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:90%
Does it help me escape it?

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:05.540 align:middle line:84%
No, it actually forces
me to dive deeper into it

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:84%
because that kind of work
really calls for a deeper

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:84%
level of reality, and it
requires such a profound level

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.220 align:middle line:90%
of truth to do that work.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And in order for
me to teach that,

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:90%
I have to really taste it.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:84%
There's something
raw and visceral

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
about what I've
experienced that I can then

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:84%
locate in text or in
the life of the work

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.543 align:middle line:84%
that every single writer
has written about,

00:30:38.543 --> 00:30:39.960 align:middle line:84%
which is about the
human condition

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and how we all suffer and try
to identify it and connect

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to it, and then hopefully,
be able to bring that out

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:90%
in the actors that I work with.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:84%
When you're faced with
your own mortality,

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
you will surprise
yourself by what

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
you are willing to do to
transform those circumstances

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:90%
so you can make it.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to go along
this journey or any journey

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that you're taking as
an actor as an artist

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.780 align:middle line:84%
revealing the human condition
to not go at it with judgment,

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
but go at it with
compassion, trying

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to understand a human being
the circumstances they're in

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and what they are doing
to try to survive or make

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that circumstance
better for their life.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:90%

>> The failure of medications
in treating the underlying cause

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.140 align:middle line:10%
of almost any chronic illness
is evidence that we are seeking

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:10%
answers from a system that
isn't even asking the right

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:10%
questions.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:84%
A diagnosis is just a label that
represents symptoms but ignores

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:84%
the purpose the underlying
information our biology is

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
telling us, and puts a limit
on our healing potential.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.150 align:middle line:84%
But if we are to transform
our medical system,

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:84%
we must expect more
from ourselves.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:84%
We can't avoid
years of suffering

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.863 align:middle line:84%
by learning what true health
is and applying that knowledge.

00:32:14.863 --> 00:32:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Those of us in
this film have been

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:84%
fortunate to encounter
the incredible pioneers

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and true healers who
are always pushing

the evolution of medicine.

But anyone on this
path must also

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.070 align:middle line:10%
go on a journey within as one
of the most essential components

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:10%

But when that is
challenged, we have

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to seek the light in the dark
and have an unlimited frame
