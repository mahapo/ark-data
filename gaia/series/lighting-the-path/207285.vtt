to do some soul searching,

whatever this is that this new

wizard is going to do
if this doesn't work,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know what else
I'm supposed to do after that.

>> Biological medicine has
utilized technology where other

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
facets of alternative medicine,
such as naturopathic medicine

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:84%
or we even say classical
Chinese medicine, I mean,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
they still have their
own diagnostics,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.060 align:middle line:84%
but they're missing a lot of
the technological advances that

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:90%
probably occurred.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of those
being thermography,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
which test 119 points, so we can
see which organs are basically

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
responding, or which
organs are heating

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.462 align:middle line:84%
or which organs have
blood flow in the patterns

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
that they're supposed
to have blood flow.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:84%
We want to do heart
rate variability

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.515 align:middle line:84%
so we can see is your
nervous system more stressed

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:84%
or is your nervous
system more relaxed.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Then we do unique
scans and looking

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
at different parts of
the body and seeing

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
which parts of the
body are actually doing

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:90%
what they're supposed to do.

make this a little easier.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:84%
When I'm looking at treatment
plants, and I'm seeing like,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.070 align:middle line:84%
wow, that's a lot, like that
is a lot of things to do.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
a lot of things

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to do, it's a lot of
things for your body to do,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.460 align:middle line:90%
and in her particular case.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was on
the right track.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's not try to do
everything all at once.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.382 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, let's get a little
bit more into the diagnostics

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:01.965 align:middle line:84%
and figure out maybe
what we shouldn't

00:02:01.965 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
be doing at the same time that
we're doing something else.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then her big
piece was, let's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.202 align:middle line:84%
look at this hormonal
system and let's

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
look at this nervous
system, and let's at least

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.262 align:middle line:90%
put these things into play.

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:84%
All the rest of
these tests, as far

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
as kidney clearing
tests, liver enzymes,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.630 align:middle line:84%
everything looks
great because you've

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
done a great job of
keeping a clean lifestyle.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.225 align:middle line:90%
I need your body to relax.

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:10%
That's what it wants to do.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:10%
Let's relax, open
up some blood flow,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.037 align:middle line:10%
send some white blood
cells and tissues.

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Spirochetes are somewhere
because your white blood cells

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:90%
aren't.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.445 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that doesn't
work when you put more blood

00:02:37.445 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
flow into it because you
get more nutrition there,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:90%
and you get more waste away.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Testing of Layne's digestive
system determined she did not

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
have enough energy or
heat to digest raw foods.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Intestinal stuff is cold.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
If you eat a salad
in a cold system,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.834 align:middle line:84%
now we've created
40 hours of work.

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:90%
You just got to put blood flow.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:90%
You say, Jeff, I'm freezing.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you're
spending all your blood

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:90%
on your salad.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's just a waste of time.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It's a better way to eat.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's a way to eat
when you have a machine

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:90%
to break that food down.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We might as well let the
crock-pot spend its energy,

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:90%
than you spend your energy.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
After you've gone through
illness or disease, or stress,

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, those cells
don't have the ability

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.535 align:middle line:90%
to produce energy.

00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's what food
is supposed to do.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to eat food.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.343 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be a
certain amount of work

00:03:36.343 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:84%
to get this amazing energy
out of it, but a lot of times,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:84%
even that digestive track is
too tired to make that exchange.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take treatments
and actually get the body

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
or exogenously get
the body to produce

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:90%
energy instead of endogenously.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And then that provides
us a bank account

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to be spent on other parts of
the clinic, which is usually

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
again focused on some
of the detoxification

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and reworking of things that
we don't want in the body.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>> When multiple systems
are not working efficiently

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:90%
or properly, it gets run down.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
ideally, the charge

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
within an individual cell
should be at a certain point.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So we use things
like Magno-pulse.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
We use things like an
electron foot bath.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
We use things like Valkion
to literally try and recharge

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
somebody's battery to get their
cells working more efficiently.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Electron foot baths usually
lasts 30 to 45 minutes.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
We use conduction to
drive and shift electrons

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.552 align:middle line:84%
The treatment may help with
cellular complication energy

00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:35.177 align:middle line:84%
and complement other treatments
by enhancing treating benefits.

00:04:35.177 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in 2007, Rick and I had
explored a way to give the body

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
energy through
microcurrent treatment,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
as delivering an electrical
current can help fuel cell

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.830 align:middle line:84%
energy production
and communication.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I'm watching the timer
here because I'm coming down

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the
treatment in about an hour.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.585 align:middle line:84%
Towards the end, I'm pretty
ready to be done with it

00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
just because it starts to tingle
and kind of itch a little bit,

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of annoying.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But probably a price to
pay if it works right.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.295 align:middle line:84%
>> We even treated
meridians through the teeth.

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it now is a
good time for us to check.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think so.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>> No one can say we didn't go
out to the edges of alternative

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:90%
medicine, right?

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:10%
>> How's your grip strength
just in general compared to six

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:10%
months ago?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>> I just saw that again
today, and the grip strength is

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:10%
the same as before
these treatments.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.075 align:middle line:84%
>> While I received some
temporary relief, Rick did not.

00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Though, he probably
would have required

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
months of additional
therapy, which

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
wasn't financially
realistic for either of us.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:10%
Years later, I tried it
again, and the microcurrent

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:10%
significantly reduced
my inflammation

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.903 align:middle line:10%
as I began walking
without a cane.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Though, as soon
as I had to reduce

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of treatments,
my swelling returned.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:14.632 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:10%
Impressed though
with the potential

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.100 align:middle line:10%
of technology,
the broad approach

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:10%
of biological medicine,
and Layne's experience,

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:10%
I began a week of treatments.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:10%
This included IV
blood ozone therapy.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> We draw the blood out.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.963 align:middle line:84%
We inject ozone into
your blood, and then it

00:06:29.963 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:90%
goes back in the system.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's very safe,
it's very hygienic.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.525 align:middle line:90%
It oxygenates the blood.

00:06:34.525 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you
oxygenate the blood,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:90%
you oxygenate the tissues.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's very effective
as an antiseptic.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's very effective for killing
off infections and pathogens,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and it does
oxygenate your cells,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.420 align:middle line:84%
plus it kind of stimulates
your antioxidant ability

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I also did ionized
oxygen therapy,

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:10%
as well as the magnapulse, a
pulsed electromagnetic field

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:10%
therapy, which can help
recharge the mitochondria within

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:10%
the cells.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I will just make lightning
shoot out of my eyes

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It was clear the treatments
added power to my cells as I

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
actually felt worse while
my immune system used

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
the additional
energy for healing.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.725 align:middle line:84%
Severe fatigue and increased
joint pain followed.

00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
After a month of
misery, I gave in

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and had Dr. Franco drain my
knee and hit it with cortisone.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Temporary but essential relief.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:10%
My latest knee x-rays revealed
continued deterioration

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:10%
of the cartilage from 30
years of inflammation.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Rheumatoid arthritis
over time can actually

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
cause traditional
osteoarthritis.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:10%
>> This is a lateral view to
see virtually no space there.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is your right knee,
which is also involved,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and there is very little space.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
You can see there, and you have
a spur on this side as well.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Knee replacements could
possibly improve some

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
of the joint pain, but unless
we solve the underlying cause

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
of the inflammation, I would
still have swelling in all

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:90%
the surrounding tissues.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
My lab work showed
my vitamin D was low,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:84%
despite what I thought
was an adequate dose

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:90%
in my multivitamin.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D is actually
a powerful hormone

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that can control the expression
of genes in the body.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Extensive studies have
shown a majority of people

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
are deficient and that keeping
your blood levels at above 60

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
nanograms per milliliter
is essential and can

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
help prevent not just autoimmune
diseases but cancer and heart

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
This would require a
bit more sun exposure

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as increasing
my supplement

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
to 10,000 international
units per day.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You had said that you
personally were diagnosed with

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:90%
rheumatoid arthritis.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wakes up with rheumatoid
arthritis at 14 years old.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Nobody does.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:90%
It's there for years beforehand.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You just have to kill off
enough cells that eventually

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
that tissue can't
work right anymore.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when
you have elevated antibodies

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.360 align:middle line:90%
to your own tissue.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
That's called the autoimmune
spectrum, that it starts

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
with the elevated
antibodies eventually,

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
the organ that the antibodies
are attacking, whether it's

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
your thyroid or your joint or
your brain, whatever tissue

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
it is, can't function
right anymore because it's

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
been being destroyed enough.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Now you start getting symptoms,
and then eventually, you

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:90%
get the diagnosis.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Melissa Arbuckle
published a paper in 2003

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:90%
that identified this.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a game-changer for us
in the world of health care.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
She went to the VA and
asked for permission

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to look at the blood of the
currently diagnosed lupus

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
patients when they were
healthy in the Navy years ago.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:90%
And she got permission.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:90%
What did she find?

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Every single lupus patient
had the seven antibodies

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to lupus or seven
elevated five years

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:90%
before they ever had a symptom.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And some of these antibodies
were elevated 11 years

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
before they ever had symptoms,
and so the point for anyone

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
with an autoimmune condition
is to work with a doctor

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
to go back and find out why
are these antibodies elevated?

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of what's
on the end of my fork?

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And there are
literally thousands

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
of studies of food sensitivities
contributing to the development

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:90%
of autoimmunity.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of what
I'm breathing, toxic air?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it because of emotions?

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.820 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
stop this mechanism,

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to go back
and find out what's

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.750 align:middle line:90%
triggering the mechanism.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.225 align:middle line:90%
Not just deal with the symptoms.

00:10:39.225 --> 00:10:41.997 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.997 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Things that we didn't
even think were possible,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:10%
like your emotions affecting
your immunity, you know,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:10%
it wasn't that long ago.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:10%
It was just a few decades ago
that was considered heresy.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.610 align:middle line:10%
And the field that I grew
up in, my scientific field,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:10%
psychoneuroimmunology,
didn't even

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:10%
exist 40 years ago
because this idea

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:10%
that the mind and the
immune system were connected

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:10%
didn't make sense to the
scientists at that time.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:10%
And so then what you had
were this dedicated group

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:10%
of scientists that had
some interesting data,

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:10%
and they said, you know, what?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing something
that's making

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:84%
us think that the
immune system might

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.130 align:middle line:90%
be connected to the brain.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Because of that dedicated effort
of this group of scientists,

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.550 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge field of
psychoneuroimmunology,

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%
psychoneuroendocrinology.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
What it's teaching us is
that we have profound power

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:90%
over our own health.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So all these things
that we thought

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
we needed to take
some outside agent

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
or seek an outside
person to help us

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
with, we're starting to
realize, well, maybe I'm

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.085 align:middle line:90%
the healing agent.

00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it actually
starts with me,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and it starts with
my own consciousness,

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and it starts with how I'm
processing my emotions.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.515 align:middle line:90%
Am I processing them?

00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Am I a slave to them?

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It plays a huge
role in our health,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.905 align:middle line:84%
and we're just discovering
how deep that connection is.

00:11:53.905 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
You are an energetic
system, and you are also

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
not separate from
your environment.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:10%
We think that we are
this discrete object,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:10%
and we end with the hair
on our skin, at which point

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:10%
the rest of the universe
begins, but it's not like that.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We're part of a giant
pulsating energy field,

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're trading information
all the time with this field.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And so, that essentially on
its own changes everything.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you've
got the whole idea

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that thoughts are
in actual something

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
with the capacity to
change physical matter,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and that also
changes everything.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get past
the idea that things

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.560 align:middle line:90%
are finite and stable.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And also, the other
thing to understand

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
is that a quantum particle
isn't an actual anything yet.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just a potential
of something.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It's only made and realized
when an observer or a scientist

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
takes a measurement
or observes it.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:90%
That old idea is huge.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It really changes what healing
is, and it changes who I am

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:90%
and how I'm supposed to live.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The BioMed Center added
yet another way of delivering

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:90%
frequency to the body.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Two minutes into sitting
in front of the laser,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I started to feel a tremendous
well of emotion coming up from

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:90%
inside of me.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It was just like
something cracked open

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:90%
endless, endless tears.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever cried
like that in my whole life.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It was clear evidence that there
was something else going on

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
besides just pain in
my joints, that there

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
some other work that

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:90%
was going to have to be done.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:10%
>> So, first of all, I believe
that any physical illness is

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:10%
a psychological,
emotional component to it.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So it always makes
sense to me that when

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
you work with somebody
who has particularly

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
a chronic condition--
heart disease, cancer,

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disorders, chronic
pain to always investigate

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:90%
the emotional component.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing to me how many
people go through the medical--

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.820 align:middle line:84%
into a medical treatment
without even considering

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.120 align:middle line:90%
that there is an issue.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So, in my work with
people over time,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I focus more on the
question of identity.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So, how does
identity develop in?

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
How does experiences that they
would go through in your life,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it's trauma or diseases
or positive experiences,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and they construct and influence
or structure of identity?

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we have a lot
to hide, not from other people,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
actually mostly form
ourselves, things

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't come
to terms with for fear,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.090 align:middle line:84%
for certain memories that
are very painful for us,

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and we protect
ourselves from that.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a very thick barrier.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you start crossing
through that barrier,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
it's like there is a lot of
energy there that is stored,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and it has to come out.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out all the
time, actually for people.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, it comes
out as emotional outbursts.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It comes out as
illnesses that stress

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that there are
those illnesses they

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.930 align:middle line:84%
become integrated
into self-perception,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:90%
into a state of identity.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, for me, the
purpose is to investigate that.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
What it usually leads to people
is to breaking that identity

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and reconstructing it again
in a way that is healthier.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:10%
>> I see trauma as something
that happens that overwhelms

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:10%
us; overwhelms us beyond
our capacity to rebound.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely involves
certain systems in the brain.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about that.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, it involves
things that happen in the body.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
threatened, we stiffen,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
we brace, we go into
preparation for fight or flight,

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:90%
or we collapse--

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:84%
freeze or collapse in
overwhelming helplessness.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:10%
Things happen within the nervous
system that don't unhappen.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:10%
And different traumas or
stress, neglect, abuse, things

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:10%
like that, they
accumulate over time.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:10%
The work of Felitti
on the ACE studies

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:10%
where you look at
a certain number

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:10%
of these adverse
childhood experiences,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:10%
and if they add up
to a certain amount,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:10%
you're going to be very likely
suffering from a whole spectrum

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.632 align:middle line:10%
of conditions.

00:16:21.632 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So, the ACE study or the
adverse childhood effects study

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:10%
was a joint effort between
the CDC and Kaiser.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And it was a longitudinal study
that lasted about over 40 years

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:10%
where they followed people
from early childhood

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:10%
into adulthood to
identify the correlation

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:10%
between adverse
childhood effects

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:10%
and how that then impacted
both physical and mental health

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:10%
later on in adulthood.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So things like,
was there a parent

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that was a substance
abuser, or a parent in jail,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
or was there physical, sexual,
or emotional abuse in the home.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, the higher
number of experiences

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
that children had
positively correlated

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to the kind of breadth of
physical or mental illness

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
that they would then
experience in adulthood.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Things that happen and
throw our nervous system,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:10%
particularly the core regulatory
parts of our nervous systems

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.190 align:middle line:10%
out of line.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:10%
And once that happens, unless
we find a way to shift out

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:10%
of that, it remains chronic.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I would be observing
animal behavior in the wild

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and noticing that, after
an encounter a threat,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
they would often
shake and tremble.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
But I was also noticing this
in the clients and the people

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that I was starting
to work with who

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
were suffering from
these kinds of traumas,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:90%
and they were very similar.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But the difference is
animals do that naturally.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:90%
They don't think about it.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:90%
It just happens.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
happens with people

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:90%
is we overthink ourselves.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:10%
So when the very sensations
that will help bring us back

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:10%
to equilibrium are
occurring, we fear of them,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:10%
and we brace against them.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:10%
We hold them back.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:10%
And therefore,
preventing the system

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:10%
from coming back
into equilibrium.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:10%
So one of the core aspects
of somatic experiencing

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:10%
is we help people befriend
these very sensations that

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.760 align:middle line:10%
take them out of
the shutdown or out

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:10%
of the hyper-arousal
adrenalized state

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:10%
and let them come back to
equilibrium because, again, we

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:10%
are our nervous systems.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
designed to do that.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> With such a breakthrough
on the last session with anger

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and some of the homework you
gave me in my meditations,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's been very
helpful to continue to work

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that there's more
to release in terms of stress

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of buildup from
all those years of pain.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Some work that I really like
to do is kidney adrenal work,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
which just means offering
some concentrated support

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:84%
in the region of the
kidneys and the adrenals.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, that gives
people an experience

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:84%
of feeling really supported,
like someone's got their back.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like, you can join me
with your awareness in the area

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:14.885 align:middle line:90%
where my hand is.

00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of bring
your attention

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:84%
there, noticing what it's like
to have some extra support

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:90%
in that region.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:27.123 align:middle line:84%
I can actually feel kind of the
kidney dropping a little bit

00:19:27.123 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
more towards my
hand, and I'm just

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
curious if you notice anything
in that region right now.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just relaxing like that.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it opens
up space for emotion.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, I guess just started
to feel a lot of emotion.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> How might you have labeled
that emotion or this emotion?

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It was like relief.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is it
about the touch that

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.285 align:middle line:84%
does that to the body or
you're bringing an awareness

00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:02.085 align:middle line:90%
to an area--

00:20:02.085 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, Peter Levine said
it so simple but perfectly that

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:84%
conscious awareness aids the
rewiring of the nervous system.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So even just bringing our
awareness to something

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that very attention provides
an opportunity for some kind

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:90%
of shift to happen.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:84%
In the nervous system, you
have two primary branches--

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:90%
sympathetic, parasympathetic.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:10%
If you think about the
nervous system as a car,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:10%
the sympathetic
branch is essentially

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:10%
the gas pedal of the car.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
When there is trauma and
especially developmental trauma

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:84%
from an early
stage, what happens

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is the sympathetic turns
on, and it never turns off

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
because the system
is chronically

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
in a state of
stress, whether that

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
has to do with environmental
factors, psychological factors,

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
or even physical ones
like young children who

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
are put on antibiotics
for long periods of time,

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.600 align:middle line:84%
it puts a stress, a
load on their system

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:90%
and creates more inflammation.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So sympathetic is
supposed to turn off.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:03.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Parasympathetic is sort
of hanging out waiting,

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
for it to turn off,
and it doesn't.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:10%
So essentially, what happens is
sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:10%
turn on and stay on
at the same time.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:10%
What happens are two things
simultaneously, you go nowhere,

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.610 align:middle line:10%
and you burn the engine out.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:10%
So one kind of perspective
about what autoimmune

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:10%
could be in regards to trauma
is the autoimmune disorder

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:10%
comes online as a
way to mimic what

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:10%
the parasympathetic system,
the rest and digest system

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:10%
is supposed to do, but can't
do because when somebody

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:10%
struggling with autoimmune,
the primary thing they need

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:10%
is to rest and to slow down.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a forced
artificial resting with the idea

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that hopefully,
they'll rest enough,

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:84%
that the body will be able
to heal itself and get back

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:90%
into those natural rhythms.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, the idea is to
get those core systems back

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:84%
into a regulatory state to get
to where the nervous system is

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
perceiving safety and not
just threat and competition.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if we're
in that kind of place,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
it does put this load
on our nervous system

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and disconnects us more
and more from our bodies.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.325 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's great that
you're taking this path.

00:22:21.325 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So my friend Rick continued
to work and write despite

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
a gradual worsening
of his condition.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.645 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he got severe
pneumonia and passed away.

00:22:38.645 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:90%
This was really tough.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he and I were
really good friends.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:90%
And I miss him.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was originally
supposed to be

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:90%
a big part of this documentary.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, we started out on this
journey together and exploring

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of modalities.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.305 align:middle line:84%
We talked about ending
this movie with us

00:23:05.305 --> 00:23:06.555 align:middle line:90%
running on the beach together.

00:23:06.555 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, something
now that won't happen.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
He even gave me a little
business card holder engraved

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
a jog on the beach together.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I miss him.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I miss our conversations.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I admired how much his
resilience rubbed off on me.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But we may not run on
the beach together,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
but he's with me in spirit,
and I think of him often.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Layne continued her
treatments using biological

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:10%
medicine and was actually now
able to pedal a bike to do

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:10%
exercise with oxygen therapy,
a process of depriving,

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:10%
then flooding the body's cells
with oxygen to increase cell

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:10%
respiration and detoxification.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.533 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.533 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have to have to not
be on my knees for a second.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
It felt like we hit a plateau,
and things stayed the same.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.885 align:middle line:84%
The way that I was
approaching my healing

00:24:14.885 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:84%
was the way that I
had been approaching

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:84%
my life the whole time,
very rigid, very certain.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I was keeping
emotions locked away.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:10%
I hadn't ever processed a lot
of things that had happened.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
I was angry about being sick.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
I was angry about losing
all of those years.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I was angry about having
to be in a wheelchair.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I was denying that I felt shame
around having gotten sick.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot of hours in
meditation sitting quietly.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:84%
I would picture myself in
control in the way itself,

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
carrying this other self
of me and depositing me

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:90%
into the chair to have the IV.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And carrying me
step out of the way,

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
just deliver myself so that I
could receive the treatment.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I would let go into
it and just allow.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's some kind
of magic in that.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:40.573 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.573 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to give a quick
shout-out and say thank you

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to my knees, who have
been amazing on this trip.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you to both of my knees.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I have walked so far
and so hard this trip.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I have really, really
trumped up the size of cliffs

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.070 align:middle line:84%
down hundreds and
hundreds of stairs,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's just something that
I didn't know if I would ever

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
have again, and
I'm so incredibly

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.615 align:middle line:84%
grateful to have been
able to hike and tromp

00:26:06.615 --> 00:26:07.415 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:26:07.415 --> 00:26:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> After nearly a year, my
diagnostics were improving as I

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
optimized the systems of my body
through biological medicine,

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
somatic experiencing,
and meditation.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
The more I meditated
the more convinced

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.215 align:middle line:84%
I became of its
incredible power.

00:26:35.215 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The mind now full of more
noise than at any time

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
humanity, meditation

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.430 align:middle line:90%
is a powerful antidote.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Calming your brain waves
relaxes the nervous system,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.220 align:middle line:90%
which is essential for healing.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
A focus on just
the breath or heart

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
shifts your attention
from thinking

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:84%
to feeling, which further
calms your neural activity.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The stillness opens a door
to a broader consciousness

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and a connection to what
science calls the quantum field

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.275 align:middle line:84%
and what spiritual
texts call the divine.

00:27:31.275 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
From this state, I
visualize a future event

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.152 align:middle line:84%
while generating
and experiencing

00:27:39.152 --> 00:27:40.235 align:middle line:90%
the corresponding emotion.

00:27:40.235 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
This is an awesome
escape from reality

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.660 align:middle line:84%
while potentially
creating a new one.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:90%
