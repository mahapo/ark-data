00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Mithraism was a clandestine
religion which preceded

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Christianity and was practiced
in the Roman Empire from

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
the first through the
fourth centuries AD.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
The legacy of Mithra holds
important to the very core

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:84%
of secret religions and
societies throughout Europe

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:90%
even today.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Symbolic references
to Mithraism appear

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
in several institutions
of spirituality and power,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
including Egyptian
and Masonic temples,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.075 align:middle line:90%
and even in the Vatican.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:10%
This is Mithra,
portrayed in this case

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:10%
as a lion-headed deity, a
serpent coiling his torso.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:10%
In this and other depictions,
he has four wings,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:10%
commonly portraying symbols
representing the four seasons,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes holding a key or two,
sometimes a scepter, sometimes

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:10%
a sword, and often atop a globe
adorned with a diagonal cross.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Mithra represents both time and
the time process of the Yugas.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
The lion-headed figure appears
in a wide range of images

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.795 align:middle line:90%
from various periods in history.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
In this image from
Manly Palmer Hall,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
he is depicted as a standing
figure, coiled seven times

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.520 align:middle line:90%
by a serpent.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
In his right hand are seven
stars arranged in a heptagon,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:90%
and the eighth in the center.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:84%
The serpent's head above the
lion head encircles a key.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.140 align:middle line:84%
He carries a sword, woven
three times by the serpent.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:84%
This gives us another
example of the 3 to 7

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:84%
relationship to the
procession of the equinox.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Finally, bowing before him
are three figures representing

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:90%
the three durations of time--

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:84%
the past, the present,
and the future.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
He seems to be emerging from
a carved stone, a monolith

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:90%
within a quarry of rock.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:84%
This symbolizes that Mithra,
a time deity born from rock,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is embedded in the
processes of earth

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and, in its most permanent
form, the formation of stone.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:84%
This image and myth
of Mithra leads us

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
into an understanding
of gnosticism.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The source of the
gnostic belief system

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:90%
is still not fully known.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to have emerged
from somewhere in the Middle

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
East, perhaps from the region of
the Caucasus between the Black

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and Caspian Seas and
the Armenian plateau,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:84%
in what is today
Northern Turkey.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Many of the teachers
in this region who

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
may have come from lineages
which originated in Babylon

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:84%
influenced the sudden
philosophical surge

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and outgrowth that resulted
in the explosion of knowledge

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%
and culture in Greece.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
This sudden explosion of
knowledge cannot be explained

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
in any natural way, eventually
becoming one of the most

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
influential schools of
philosophical development,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and maintains that
influence even today.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:10%
Gnosticism is associated
with this very early story

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:10%
and to the growth of esoteric
philosophy in recorded history.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:10%


00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:10%
The gnostics revered a female
deity by the name of Sophia.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Sophia is a feminine goddess,
who the gnostics believed

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
began as an energetic
field emerging

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
This particular energy
field carried within it

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:84%
all the vibrational qualities
necessary for the manifestation

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:90%
of embodied consciousness.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It was said that Sophia was of
a certain quality of energy that

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.601 align:middle line:90%
serves the all.

00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:84%
The ALL with all capital letters
is the original primary unity.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:10%
And the "all" with
lowercase letters

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.010 align:middle line:10%
is the creation of the universe,
in which everything comes out

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.865 align:middle line:10%
as separate parts.

00:04:33.865 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.995 align:middle line:84%
It's the same relationship of
one as unity and one as units.

00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:84%
As units, we have 1, 2, 3,
4, and so on into infinity.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the infinity
of the unit.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is the absolute,
undefiled, undivided integrity

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:90%
of the totality.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Sophia serves the all
by reflecting back to it

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:90%
the beauty of its own creation.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:84%
This is counter to the Greek
and Judeo-Christian beliefs

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that mankind is made
in the image of God.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Through the Sophian
myth, mankind

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:90%
is made as the mirror of God.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
This seemingly subtle
difference between the mirror

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and the reflected
image within the mirror

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%
is philosophically
rather significant.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Sophia is conceptually
reminiscent

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:84%
of the beautiful
wisdom of the Puranas.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether we know it or not,
all things come into existence

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:90%
through that which precedes it.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom of Sophia infers that
the whole creation of the all

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
would not have a
manifest existence

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:90%
unless it was reflected.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Sophia makes the great
sacrifice of being

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:90%
a universal field of energy.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And she descends into the
cosmos to begin a transformation

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:90%
into the earth.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:84%
We are not talking about the
earth as a particular sphere

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
in a particular place
in the spiraling galaxy,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
but rather the place process
that allows consciousness

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:90%
to become manifest as form.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
The purpose that the gnostics
give to our existence--

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:90%
our origins--

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is that we must
perceive and conceive

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
with great accuracy the nature
and profound characteristics

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:90%
of the all.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Sophia began her transformation
in gnostic mythology.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:84%
As the story goes,
Sophia has within her

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
create life, which

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
she does with such profusion and
force that life and life forms

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:90%
literally pour out of her.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
The elders who govern
all the forces that

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
come from the center
of this galaxy

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:90%
saw that Sophia was in crisis.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So they sent a force which
could bring order and limitation

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and a permanent basis for the
organization of her outpouring.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.985 align:middle line:90%
This form came as a spiral.

00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Such as we see when we look at
the seed pattern in a sunflower

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
or in a pine cone,
these patterns

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
are arranged in a
very precise order.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You see it in every seed
spiral of a sunflower

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:90%
or a rose or a lotus.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:90%
They have 14 circles.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
That order, as we
will see later,

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:84%
repeats over and
over and over again

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.090 align:middle line:84%
in the relationships
of the golden mean.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
That force that
they sent to rescue

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Sophia, bringing in this
process of formal organization,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:90%
is called the Christos.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the source
myth of the name

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
of Christ, the epithet that
was acquired by Christianity.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.100 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, a
movement of Christianity

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
set out to proclaim gnosticism
as a heresy worthy of death.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
This became one of the many,
though rarely discussed even

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:84%
today, genocidal
periods that took place

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
in Europe in the first few
centuries of the common era.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Normandy was an area
of northern France

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
occupied by the Normans,
an ethnic group comprised

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
of indigenous French and
Norse Viking settlers

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
decades of invasions

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
on the French coast from
Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
The Normans were some of the
most skilled shipbuilders

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:90%
and sailors in European history.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence
of their influence

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:84%
as far away as
North America, where

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
it is believed that the
Normans landed in Nova Scotia

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
sometime in the
1300s and traveled

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.040 align:middle line:84%
south to what is
today Massachusetts,

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Rhode Island, and Cape Cod.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Back in Europe, the Normans
grew in power and influence.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Coupled with
influence from Persia

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and the Byzantine Empire, the
Normans of Southern France,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
as it is speculated, eventually
formed the religious group

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:90%
known as the Cathars.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars came under
constant ridicule and contempt

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
by the Church of England
and, as a result,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
formed yet another religious
group known as the Puritans

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th and
17th centuries AD.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The Puritans were, again,
a seafaring bloodline

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and, in their attempt to
purify the Church of England,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:84%
were the first people to
found permanent settlements

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
There are infamous stories
of Norman bloodlines

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
who played significant
roles in the discovery

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and identification of
otherwise unexplored corners

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:90%
of the globe.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
Normans traveled east

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and founded the Knights
Templar at the Temple Mount

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem and supposedly
brought back the treasures

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:90%
from King Solomon's temple.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:84%
In Scotland and England, there
started the famous bloodline

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:90%
of the Sinclair family.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Henry Sinclair, Earl of
Orkney was a great explorer

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and launched a series
of sea expeditions,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:90%
including to Nova Scotia.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
There is speculation that Henry
Sinclair was also a Knight

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Templar and that his
voyage to the New

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.550 align:middle line:84%
World nearly 100
years before Columbus

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:90%
was funded by the Templars.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
This is yet another
segment of world history

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:84%
that is kept under the
carpets of the academic world.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.880 align:middle line:84%
However, we have ample proof
that these Normans traveled

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
both west to make
the first discoveries

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.210 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called New World and
east into the ancient world,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
pulling together
under the dictates

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
of their gnostic religion
and the dictates of the laws

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:90%
of Mithra, the laws of time.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
They brought back treasure
to Europe, much of which

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
has given way to
legend and lore,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
including being buried in
sites such as Rennes-le-Chateau

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
in Southern France.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
While much of this is
considered quasi-history,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
there are historical
characters who

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
came out of the same
bloodlines of northern Europe,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
such as Bernard
de Clairvaux, who

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:84%
it is claimed was
instrumental in creating

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:84%
the ideal of Christian nobility
known as the Knights Templar.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
All of this is involved
with a single family,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
a single bloodline
that organized itself

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.040 align:middle line:84%
into secret societies
and maneuvered

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface
of the Christian world

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:90%
as a hidden faction.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Many of the conflicts
that have contributed

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:84%
to a bloodied
European history are

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
the result of the
hidden struggles

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:90%
between these factions.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Remember that Christianity
spread throughout Europe thanks

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:84%
in large part to a group which
we identify as the apostles,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the disciples of Jesus
Christ, particularly Paul

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and his negotiations with the
Roman emperor Constantine, who

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
took control over the
formation of the last phases

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Not only did Constantine allow
Christians to live freely

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, he assisted
them in building up

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
out of the collapsing
structure of the Roman Empire.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The church took over
these structures

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:90%
as the monastic system.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
That is the way Christianity was
able to take over and continue

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.330 align:middle line:84%
the power of Rome
in the disguise

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:90%
of the cleric or the priest.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Both of these
factions, one overtly

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
through the establishment of
institutions and philosophies

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and one covertly
through bloodline,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
were following the
dictates of the Yuga.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They used the Yuga
dates and Yuga forces

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:90%
to implement their power.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember, those Yuga
forces are the forces

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Kali Yuga,
which ultimately

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:84%
lead to disintegration
and destruction.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The Norman world underwent
devastating attacks

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:84%
from the factions that were
reformulating the Roman

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Empire into the
Holy Roman Empire

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
with the help of the
proliferation of Christianity.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:10%
During this period,
anyone whose philosophies

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:10%
contradicted that of the
predominant Christian

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:10%
philosophy was met with strict
resistance and, in many cases,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:10%
genocide.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.905 align:middle line:90%
Such was the fate of paganism.

00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
However, at that time, several
members of the Templars

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
had risen to tremendous power.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
They used their
seafaring instincts

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:84%
from their Norman bloodlines to
set up vast networks of trade

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
all around the
Mediterranean Sea.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:84%
With that trade, they were
able to amass great fortune

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.920 align:middle line:84%
in material wealth, which
they were then able to loan

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to various European kings who
were suffering financially

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:90%
due to constant wars.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
The Templars then, with this
acquisition of material wealth

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and power, soon became
the target for the Vatican

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and the Holy Roman Empire,
which attempted to wipe out

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.320 align:middle line:90%
the Templars once and for all.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But the Templars' command
of the sea continued.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Using the maps of the
unexplored world handed down

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
through the Norman legacy,
which occupied the Mediterranean

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.600 align:middle line:84%
coastline, as well as southern
France and Spain at the time,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the Templars identified
a Naval officer

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.265 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Christopher Columbus.

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
After the church's attack on
the Cathars in Southern France,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
the Templars dispersed.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
They made settlements in
Germany and the Netherlands.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.220 align:middle line:84%
One of the great Norman warriors
was William the Conqueror,

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
who took the Norman tribes
into power in England.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:10%
But that Norman power became
overwhelmed by the gent

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity, Oliver
Cromwell, lord protectorate

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:10%
of the Commonwealth of
England, Scotland, and Ireland.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
There is this constant structure
of conflict and bloodshed

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:84%
that is based on this earlier
platform of conflict brought

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
against a deeply
philosophical tradition

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that the Roman
movement attempted

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.480 align:middle line:90%
to annihilate in Europe.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
The Templar philosophy,
mentality, and belief

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
was then brought to the United
States via the Puritans.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And Washington, DC, became a
receptacle for their belief

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
system, with the founding
fathers carrying out

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
every foundational ceremony
of Templar masonry.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
America has been
constantly subjected

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:84%
to a history that has
a substructure that

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
is a continuation of that
which began in the Middle East

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
advent of the Kali Yuga.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:84%
Whenever factions come
into conflict or duality

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
comes into being, there
is an initiatic teaching

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that sees this division into
conflict as a potentiality

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
to enhance and
create a hierarchy.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:11.289 align:middle line:90%
