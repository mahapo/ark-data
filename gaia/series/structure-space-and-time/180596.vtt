00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an important and
interesting symbolic method

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
for relating the whole
gnostic Sophia tradition

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:90%
to the mythology of Egypt.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian symbol, which
allows our imagination

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to comprehend aspects of the
gnostic way of understanding,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of the scarab,
perhaps specifically,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the scarabaeus sacer,
commonly referred

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:90%
to as the sacred scarab.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But the association of
the scarab and Sophia

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
is not in any way
easily apparent.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:84%
The reproduction
process of the scarab

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
is an emulation of
a symbolic Earth.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.860 align:middle line:84%
This is where Sophia and the
scarab conjoin as mythology.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Sophia is a force of energy
that materializes itself

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:90%
as a sphere of the Earth.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
In that sphere of
the Earth, her forces

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
are the emanating factors
which reproduce themselves

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:90%
as human life.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the scarab will
gather up a ball of dung,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
mold it into a sphere,
and begin rolling it.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
During the day, the
scarab rolls the ball

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
in a direction that is
oppositional to the movement

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:90%
of the sun.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:84%
As the sun moves from east to
west, wherever a scarab is,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
it will start pushing its dung
ball in the opposite direction.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
The scarab takes organic
matter and forms it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:84%
into a ball as Sophia
did with her own energy.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
She formed the ball and
put inside that ball

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.975 align:middle line:90%
her goddess forces.

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
As the scarab rolls the ball,
it will find a little cavern,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
or excavate a hole.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
There, it carefully
spends days making

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
the ball into a perfect
sphere, molding it, shaping it.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Then it will insert
into the ball its eggs.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Then, just like Sophia,
the forces of life

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.950 align:middle line:84%
are planted into her
creation of the Earth.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians in
observing beetles emerged

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.850 align:middle line:84%
from the ball of dung
believed that this behavior

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:90%
was an anomaly.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.090 align:middle line:10%
They assumed that
the male beetle

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:10%
was able to reproduce
without needing

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:10%
a female in a mode
of reproduction

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:10%
requiring only one sex,
called parthenogenesis.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They saw this behavior
as a metaphor for Sophia

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:90%
giving birth to herself.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
The whole gnostic myth is
that Sophia has no counterpart

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and that the Christos is
not her mate, but someone

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
who brings about the sense
of limitation and order.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic belief is that Sophia's
self-birthing process is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:90%
parthenogenetic--

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:90%
birth through a single being.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
They believed that
Sophia and the scarabs

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
shared this behavior,
if only in metaphor.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians personified
the scarabaeus sacer

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:10%
through the god, Khepri,
which in Egyptian means,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:10%
I am the becoming.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This passage is from the
Egyptian Book of the Dead--

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
"I am he who is
constantly appearing,

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:90%
whose real nature is unknown.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:90%
I am yesterday.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
He who has seen a million
years is one name of mine.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I pass along the waves
of those sky beings

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%
who determine destinies.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I am the master of eternity,
ordering how I am fated,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:90%
like the great beetle."

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:10%
This just begins the association
between the scarab, Sophia,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:10%
and the Kamutef.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Kamutef is a twin god
from Egypt who was

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:90%
a combination of Ra and Min.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:84%
The Kamutef is the one
who gives birth to itself,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and who throws off
the cocoon and emerges

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:90%
as a creature of flight.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:84%
The scarab rolls the ball
of dung in conjunction

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
with the movement
of the sun and moon.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Their gestational period
is 28 days, almost exactly

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:90%
a lunar cycle.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%
28 is 4 times 7.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Through a spiral of seven,
the emergence of life

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and that of death is
the same Sophian process

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.701 align:middle line:84%
of the destruction and creation
of another phase of humanity.

00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians modeled that
conception as the scarab.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:10%
At this point, it might
be valuable to trace

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:10%
the origins of the gnostic
myth of Sophia back

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:10%
to their beginnings in
both the Egyptian mythology

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:10%
and Vedic mythology.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
We have seen that by associating
Sophia with the scarab

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and emphasizing the
idea of parthenogenesis,

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that the whole sequence of the
scarab giving birth actually

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
involves, or implicates, all
three feminine archetypes--

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that of the virgin, the
mother, and the crone.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The Sophia myth is
archetypal through the idea

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
of parthenogenesis
to the Kamutef,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and also, geometrically,
to the idea of a square.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
A square is a phenomenon
that one could

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:90%
say gives birth to itself.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It multiplies.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
A square is a
multiplication of a number,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.630 align:middle line:90%
or an entity with and by itself.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
We talked about that already
with the number of the Yuga.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
These mysteries are
released once you seek out

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
the root of a number, the square
root, and also its expansion

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
into space, the
squaring of a number.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember the number
of the Yuga is 6,048.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:84%
When you find its square
root, it is 7.777.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you square
the Yuga, you

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
get a number that has roughly
the value of the solar year--

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:90%
365 and a continuing decimal--

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:90%
365.78304.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
These are the
cross-fertilization numbers

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
within the Yuga number,
a dense intersection

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
of mythological imagery
and narration with geometry

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
and numerical values.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind
of thought process

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that the mind of
ancient Egypt and India

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
held as being a sacred
faculty of human intelligence.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
If we move this
parthenogenetic principle

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:84%
into the Egyptian
myth, one of the most

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:84%
prominent relationships
that we make immediately

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.535 align:middle line:90%
is between Sophia and Isis.

00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:84%
In the myth of Isis,
Horus, and Osiris,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
there is a dark
figure called Set,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
whose name is associated
with the number seven,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and therefore in relationship
with the destructive aspects

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and necessities of
the end of the cycle.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.800 align:middle line:84%
The myth goes that Set
deceives his brother,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Osiris, and builds a coffin.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Set says that it's a coffin
for some other associate that

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
has died.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
But he wants Osiris to
lay down in the coffin

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
so he can make sure it's the
right fit, or the right size.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we are
dealing with the symbol

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
of the entire human
species when we're

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:90%
telling stories of Osiris.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Osiris was the
figure in this age

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that gave humanity the
principles of urbanization

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:90%
and agriculture.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.760 align:middle line:90%
He is an archetype of the Yuga.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
All the gifts of Osiris
mark the same period of time

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.000 align:middle line:90%
as the start of the Kali Yuga.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:10%
Then Set uses deception to
nail humanity into confinement

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and an enclosure of darkness.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Then he sets the
coffin out to sea.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:84%
After flowing through the ocean
of time, the coffin breaks up

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and the body of Osiris
is revealed again,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
where Set uses his sword to
cut Osiris into 14 pieces.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Most believe that
there are 14 pieces

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and the entire body
collectively represents 15.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:84%
We have already discovered
that the relationship

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
between 14 and 15 is
a key to understanding

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
the cycles of time.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Throughout various
interpretations,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
myth and mathematics trigger
different levels of awareness

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
concerning the actualities of
our position in time and space.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Isis then goes to seek out the
severed pieces of her husband.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
She finds only the
phallus of Osiris

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and she knows that the
only way to bring him back

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:90%
is through a rebirth.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly the Yuga story.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The only way we can bring
this Yuga to a close

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is through death and
rebirth on a species level.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In esoteric geometry,
the phallus, or at least

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
the head of the
phallus, is equated

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:90%
to the shape of the Pentagon.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
This becomes a symbol of the
reproductive power of form.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
There are three
aspects to the concept

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of the soul in ancient Egypt.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:10%
These are the Ka,
the Ba, and the Ahk.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:10%
Let's get into understanding
all three of these aspects.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:90%
We will start with the Ka.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The Ka is the physical
body and the spirit

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
that is embedded in substance.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:84%
The Ka remains behind on
Earth until the decomposition

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
The Ka is one of the
most complicated aspects

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:90%
of the human soul.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians believed
that a field of energy

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:84%
that is sevenfold in nature
exists around the body

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:90%
of a human being.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
There are seven
different vibrations

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:90%
contained within the Ka.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
These vibrations emanate
from seven centers, which

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:90%
are known in India as chakras.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these participates
as an emanating frequency which

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:90%
builds up the body of the Ka.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:84%
A major part of the
psychophysical science of Egypt

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:90%
is associated with the Ka.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting that
the Ka and the centers

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
are based on the
number 7, which is

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:90%
the basis of the Yuga system.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
This carries the vibrational
content and structure

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and moon, which
is also a seven-fold number

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and a seven-fold system.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:84%
The body of man
is a continuation

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:90%
of that same resonant cycle.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:84%
When we look even
deeper into the atom

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and molecular bindings, we
find a similar resonance

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
to the time cycles that mark
the duration of the Yuga.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
The Ka is an energy
which surrounds the body

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
but can be loosened
from the body

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:90%
through initiated practices.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we call this
practice astral travel.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:84%
One can actually employ a means
to disassociate this energy

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
from the physical body
for certain experiences.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians made
this energy body

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the basis of what we call
the invention of kingship.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Kingship is based on the Ka.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians had a
ceremonial procedure

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:84%
in which they premeditated
the potentiality of a person's

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:90%
death, particularly a pharaoh.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
The dying pharaoh would
enter into a ceremony

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
with the pharaoh that
is to take his place,

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and they would disassociate
the Ka from the dying pharaoh

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and associate it
around the new pharaoh.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh's Ka
was his royalty.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:84%
His kingship was
based upon not only

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.540 align:middle line:84%
the crown, which cuts
off and signifies

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
the crown of the
head, but also that he

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
has a Ka of 14 energy fields,
twice that of normal people.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
That is the key idea in the
great concept of kingship,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
which was essential
to the hierarchy that

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:90%
led to civilization.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
The symbol for the
Ka looks like this.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.770 align:middle line:84%
This emulates the circle of
energy around the human body,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and that the energy
can be moved and spun.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect of the Egyptian
view of the soul is the Ba.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
The Ba is the eternal
part of the soul.

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
At death, the body goes
back to the source.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the way the
Ka, through spinning,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
creates a movement in which
we can experience the nature

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.845 align:middle line:90%
of flight called astral travel.

00:12:40.845 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
There are always
different levels

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:84%
built into these
simple, little glyphs

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.010 align:middle line:90%
that the Egyptians chose.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
All of them have a depth
of meaning that most of us

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:90%
will never understand.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
According to the
ancient Egyptians,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
unless something is conveying
at least six different meanings

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, it's
not worth saying

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's not worth thinking.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect the Trinity
found within the Egyptian soul

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:90%
is the Ahk.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
While the Ka is
associated with the body,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
the Ahk is associated
with the spirit.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:90%
The Ka and the Ahk--

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
you can see how they inverse
in the way they are pronounced.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just a
reshuffling inversion

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
of the concepts of the
spirit and the body.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
One is almost the mirror
reflection of the other.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
This inversion of sounds
means that the Ka and the Ahk

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:90%
are opposites.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:84%
In order to allow the Ka to
stay with the new pharaoh,

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:90%
they mummified the old pharaoh.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:84%
They wrapped his body
and did everything

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
they could to maintain and
prevent the total decomposition

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:84%
That's what the mummification
process is all about.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They surrounded the
mummy of the dead pharaoh

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:84%
with eight coffins, one for each
of the vibrations of the Ka.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
That would be the seven
chakras and the Ka itself.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.950 align:middle line:84%
These coffins are
placed at a distance

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
from the mummified body
at the same distances

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
as the emanations of
those energies coming

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:90%
from the body in life.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
All of the Egyptian death
and afterlife practices

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
are based on the
science of the Ka.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Through mummification, they
maintain the continuity

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:90%
of the Ka.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Through these
practices and rituals,

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
a collective memory
was passed from pharaoh

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:90%
to pharaoh to pharaoh.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And he had an expanse
or an availability

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence and memory
that far exceeded his people.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
That was the reason
he was their leader.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Without this process, a true
sense of hierarchy cannot be

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:90%
maintained.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians would call
today's system of hierarchy,

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
West, an utter fraud

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
because it does not have the
element of collective knowledge

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
endowment, which
they believed was

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.260 align:middle line:84%
essential in creating a
hierarchy of the human species.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Egypt was an empire.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Egypt was a hierarchy.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
They may have been the most
enlightened of empires,

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.640 align:middle line:84%
but still, they are
part of the Kali Yuga.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian empire
was established

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and their history recorded
with hieroglyphs and in scrolls

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:84%
on the exact date of the
beginning of the Kali Yuga.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Egypt was an attempt to save
the knowledge of the ancients.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:84%
They knew they had to conform
to the processes that ultimately

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.920 align:middle line:84%
hastened the destruction
phase and transformation

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:90%
phase of our species.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they
were intent on maintaining

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and preserving some of the
higher knowledge of the past.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians, through their
monuments, hieroglyphs,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:90%
and symbols, were.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Attempting to maintain the
knowledge that knowledge had

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
been gained through the previous
54,000 years of the first three

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Yuga cycles of the over
60,000-year long Mahakalpa.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Some of the hieroglyphic-covered
granite blocks found in Egypt

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:84%
could easily survive tens
of thousands of years

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and still be readable.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Like seeing a great
storm approaching,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians went out of
their way to save the past.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the great untold
story of ancient Egypt

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and the vain attempt by
the pharaohs and priests

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the sacred
knowledge of the Golden, Silver,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and Bronze ages through the
destruction and nightmare

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:90%
of the coming Kali Yuga.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.410 align:middle line:84%
On that basis, we can expect to
find pre-Yuga knowledge guiding

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian thought,
but modified so

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
that it fits within the boundary
of time within the Yuga.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We must understand how
it is possible for us

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to participate in a transmission
and conveyance of what we are

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and what we have achieved
in this final phase

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
of a great body of time that
necessitates an extinction.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:10%
As Buddha said, an
extinguishment and a rebirth.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:10%
Let's move our discussion to
another aspect of the science

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:10%
of the soul, which is the Ahk.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:84%
The Ahk is an energy
field that always

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
remains as a configuration
within the ether

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:90%
of the heavens.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:13.990 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians believed
that they could

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
affect the vibratory
field of the sky

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
by bringing to it the soul
energy of their people.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Another way to look at this is
with a view from the Indians.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
They believe that all beings
enter this world as food

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:90%
and as food they all depart.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
That is, we are
re-assimilated into the Ahk,

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:84%
just like we assimilate food
on Earth, just as our blood

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and flesh are
assimilated by the Earth

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and give the Earth
a renewed spirit.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So it is that part of the human
soul that arrives at the Ahk

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:90%
and gives energy to the field.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Bones have an amazing duration
of self-preservation built

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:90%
into their molecular structure.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Some bones of African
Pygmies have been

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:90%
tested to be 40,000 years old.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The skeleton has a
great power of endurance

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and that is why it
represents the Ka.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
The skeleton has a connection to
the highest level of the soul.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians believed
that the leg bones--

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:10%
the femur, the tibia, and the
fibula, and the arm bones--

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:10%
the humerus, the radius, and the
ulna were of great importance.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:10%
That's also why the image
of the skull and bones

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:10%
was used by the Templars
in their rituals.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians believed that
in the core of the large bones

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
of the body were the minerals
which that person had

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
assimilated during
his life from eating,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
from taking plants and
animals from the Earth.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
They understood that all
of this was crystallized

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:90%
in a mineral form in the bones.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
That crystalline
substance of bones

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
held the vibratory
relationship to the Ahk.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
At death, there is a
separation of the soul.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
One aspect of the
soul, the Ba, belongs

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:90%
with the beings in the heavens.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But the bones keep
a vibration that

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
is in tune with the Ka,
which stays here on Earth.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The Ka is a resonant
body with the Ahk.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
The car can maintain itself
on Earth in relationship

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to the bone structure
that is left behind.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The Ka returns to the Earth
for another incarnation

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
through the vibration
of the bones.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
That way, you are constantly
reborn into the same pattern.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The third state in this division
of consciousness was in the Ba.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the immortal
state of existence.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the aspect
of consciousness

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.260 align:middle line:90%
that reincarnates.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:10%
The Ba separates
from consciousness

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:10%
at the moment of death and goes
back into the well of souls

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:10%
to be reborn again.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.430 align:middle line:84%
In our current lexicon,
the word soul and spirit

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:90%
mean essentially the same thing.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But looking at it
more closely, it

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
can be seen that the word soul
is actually referencing the Ba.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
The Ba, or the soul, never dies.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It reincarnates and
continues its pilgrimage

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:90%
towards illumination.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It has been described as
that spark of divinity

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:90%
that resides within us all.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
In the hieroglyphs
of Egypt, the Ba

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:84%
is the part of us that
is conscious of leaving

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the earth at death,
and therefore

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
is depicted as a winged
human or a human bird.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The bird symbol for
the Ba represents

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
the force that can free
itself from the Earth

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and soar into the cosmos,
liberated from gravity

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.360 align:middle line:90%
and the material realm.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
This, then, is why the
cultures of the ancient world

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
held the elaborate funerary
ceremonies and rituals.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
These were all
originally designed

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
to help these three aspects of
the soul find their way back.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The ghost of the human,
caught in the confusion

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife, is
guided back to their Ka.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Their transcendent
spirit, the Ahk,

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
goes back to its
place in the sky.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And the soul, the Ba returns
to the center of beingness.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:10%
We have talked
about an image that

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:10%
appears at the midpoint
of the Temple of Luxor,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:10%
called the Kamutef.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:10%
The Kamutef embodies the
mythological characteristics

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:10%
of the transformation
prophesied for the next phase

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:10%
of human development.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
We can show that this
image of the Kamutef

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
has a very clear mathematical
ratio of the golden mean

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:90%
to one half.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That is emphasized by the
fact that the erect phallus

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.050 align:middle line:84%
is raised up to the navel
and put into connection

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.390 align:middle line:84%
with the maternal
or birthing process,

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.630 align:middle line:84%
representing the nourishing
process of nature.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the Kamutef, his
head has the skull cap removed.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The symbolism here is that
the upper part of the body

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:90%
is shown to be mummified.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Mummification in Egypt is a
symbol of the serpentine energy

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:90%
having entered a cocoon.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Mummification and a
succession of coffins

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
also symbolize a cocoon.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The arms coming out
indicates the relationship

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:84%
between the larva
and the butterfly.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
That is a concept that
they held applicable

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to the whole development
of the human species,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have the
potential to move

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
from an Earth-bound
creature, which

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
has enclosed itself as a
larva, and then emerges

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:90%
from that process.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The larva is, of course, a
symbol of the physical Earth.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:84%
We can emerge from
that as a butterfly,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
a creature of flight, a
creature of the higher

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:90%
spheres of existence.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that creature
of flight is also

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
built into the verbalization
of this image, the Kamutef,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because the aspect of
the human organism that

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.580 align:middle line:84%
can, even in its present
state, be detached

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
from the physical body and
travel through the Earth

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and through the heavens
is the Ka, the energy

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:90%
field that surrounds our body.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.250 align:middle line:84%
The prediction of Egypt for the
future evolution of our species

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is that we will become more
assimilated to the less

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
densified form of ourselves,
which is the Ka, the energy

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
field surrounding us.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:84%
There is the possibility
that these people

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
are informed by a
kind of possession

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:90%
of the spirits of the dead.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians
believed that there

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.890 align:middle line:84%
were spirits who
were intentionally

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
captive on the Earth
in the same way

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
that pharaonic priests
captivated the spirit

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:84%
energy of one pharaoh and
passed it on to another.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
We know that such
knowledge for manipulating

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.720 align:middle line:84%
the Ka, which is an Egyptian
concept of the localized

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.670 align:middle line:84%
spirit of a person, did exist
as it is written in hieroglyphs.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:84%
After the defeat of
Mark Antony by Octavian

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and the subsequent suicidal
death of Cleopatra,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Egypt became a Roman province in
30 BC and the pharaonic people

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.560 align:middle line:84%
were faced with the
decision of whether to live

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
under the despotic rule and
potential imprisonment of Rome,

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:90%
or to seek refuge in Africa.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Many sought the latter, as
is evident by the knowledge

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.850 align:middle line:84%
discovered in various Western
African cultures, principally

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:01.077 align:middle line:90%
that of the Dogon tribe in Mali.

00:24:01.077 --> 00:24:02.538 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:24:02.538 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Dogon,
located and identified the star

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Sirius as culturally
significant,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:90%
similar to the Egyptians.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.510 align:middle line:84%
All this, thousands of years
before modern technology

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:84%
could confirm the
existence of these stars.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of conjecture,
albeit controversial,

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.060 align:middle line:84%
at which we can only
arrive with imagination.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
When we have a very limited
amount of factuality,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
we can use apparent
things as a way

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:90%
of supporting our imaginations.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
apparent things

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:84%
with which we can
extend our imagination

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:90%
through the use of symbols.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.280 align:middle line:84%
This is when a thing becomes
the symbol for something else.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:84%
This type of working will never
take on the type of knowledge

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
that is associated
with facts because that

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
is forbidden and is maintained
under the guise of secrecy

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and secret societies.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.460 align:middle line:90%
That is what initiation means.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we
expand our understanding

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Ka, the Ba, and
the Ahk by examining

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
their symbolic meaning as
the physical, intellectual,
