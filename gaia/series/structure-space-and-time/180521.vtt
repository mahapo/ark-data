00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> For the last several
years, Robert Lawlor has been

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:84%
researching the idea that
the basic laws of proportion

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and geometry, which
are inherent in space,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:90%
are also present in time.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:84%
This idea was evoked in him
by coming across the fact

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that Hindu philosophy is based
on a trinity of consciousness,

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:90%
space, and time.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:84%
The apex of this trinity
is consciousness.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
The first element is time,
and the second is space.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Philosophically,
the Hindus believe

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
that these three
elements are not

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:90%
dissociable from one another.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
They must be considered as a
totality, as a basic trinity.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
As we know, most
religions of the world

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.810 align:middle line:84%
have a trinity as the
base of their ideology.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The Father, Son, and the
Holy Ghost in Christianity.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Beauty, truth, and
justice in Platonism.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Osiris, Horus, and Isis
in Egyptian thought.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:10%
There are many other
examples of this.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:10%
In Hinduism, we
know of the trinity

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:10%
as Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
But this is an even older
concept of creation,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:10%
requiring the three elements,
consciousness, time, and space.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Space is Brahma, consciousness
is Vishnu, and time is Shiva.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Very interestingly, the
entire society of India

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
believe that inherent in
time are all the forces

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:90%
and powers of nature.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
They're locked into patterns
that express themselves

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:90%
in time.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Those forces are equal to
expansion and contraction,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:84%
like a movement
away from center,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.965 align:middle line:84%
a movement toward center,
and the center itself.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
We have then a sort
of physics that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
associated with
abstract concepts

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and that have been
deified as gods

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.555 align:middle line:84%
or archetypal characters that
embody these abstract elements.

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:84%
In that way, the
whole myth of creation

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is readable on various levels
of activities of intelligence.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus respect
the power of time

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and believe that
human consciousness

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
in its activities of
concentration, remembrance,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and imagination could
actually draw forth

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
the particular
aspects and qualities

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:90%
of the forces inherent in time.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
They organized their society
so that these three elements

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
were held in a kind of
balance within the thinking

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and imagining processes of
the entire living population.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Brahmins,
in their external rituals,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
worship the masculine principle
of Brahma, of which is space.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:84%
In their hidden
and secret rituals,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:90%
they worship the feminine.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
This was also true of
the commercial caste.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
There are four basic castes
of people in ancient India,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
the scholarly and priestly
caste, the Brahmins.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
The second is the aristocracy,
called the Kshatriya.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
These are the symbolic
rulers of the country

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
who perform the ceremonies
of centrality and power.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The third cast is the Vaishya,
the merchants, bankers,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and property owners.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth caste,
called the Shudra,

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
are the workers, artists,
and the general population

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.620 align:middle line:90%
as a whole.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the vast
majority of people

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
were in the Shudra caste.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The Shudra is where
all the arts come from,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:84%
because they are the
people of manual dexterity.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these castes,
like the Brahmins,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
worshipped a different
aspect of this trinity.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The aristocracy and the
Shudra worshipped the same.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:90%
They worship externally.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:90%
They worship the feminine.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And in secret rituals, they
worship the phallus, or male.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
There are many people who have
studied the caste system who

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
realized that this fourfold
division is necessary to hold

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:90%
up civilized populations.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Democracy is really
a veiled form

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
of this basic system
of order, based

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
on the needs which are
provided through our vocations.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
We perpetuate this
without realizing

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
it is the basic formation
of all societies.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:10%
These divisions of people into
the aptitudes and mentality

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:10%
that predominates
their vocational powers

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:10%
was a way to keep the connection
with the spiritual world

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:10%
and the forces which
surround society in balance.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:10%
In other words, by
extending and emphasizing

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:10%
the characteristics that are
basic to the forces which

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:10%
surround us in the
universe, the Hindus

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:10%
believed that they
were actually forging

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:10%
a bond and a connection
between heaven and earth,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:10%
between sky and land.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
This equalization of the
masculine and feminine powers

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
is represented in time cycles
which influence and affect

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:90%
the developments on Earth.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.400 align:middle line:84%
We will examine the very ancient
prehistoric origins of India

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and the people who settled
in India, remembering

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
that archeologically,
the Indus Valley has

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
revealed human
settlements, which

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:90%
goes back over 400,000 years.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the oldest
archeologically-verified

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.000 align:middle line:84%
settlements on the
face of the Earth.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Those findings in
caves and cave imagery,

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
which date back to
over 400,000 years,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
shows that people already
had musical instruments.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
They were hunting
with bows and arrows.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And they had already made
the first classic steps

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
towards the fundamentals
of civilization.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:84%
This was evident in the earliest
archeological finds in India.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea that many people
refer to India as Mother India

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
may have been in this
cycle of time, the place

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
where the remembrance
of previous cycles

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
began to resurface and
re-emerge as a formative force

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.003 align:middle line:84%
in the whole
development of humanity.

00:06:46.003 --> 00:06:51.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus offer us
probably the most

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.170 align:middle line:84%
exacting of all the
prophetic systems of time.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:90%
It's called the cycles of yugas.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Many people have heard of
what is called the Kali

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Yuga, in which we
are purportedly

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
well-established with
our modern society.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
To understand the
yuga principle,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
we have to acknowledge a certain
experience in our own organism,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that there are phases in the
development of our organism,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:84%
which are inherent
in and associated

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:90%
with a certain passage of time.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, we reach
seven years of age

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:90%
and our teeth fall out.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:90%
And we get new teeth.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
We have nothing
to say about that.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And by another seven
years, suddenly we

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:84%
have completely reorganized
our pelvic region or glandular

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:90%
secretions.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And we are now in
puberty, and have achieved

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:90%
sexual reproductive capacities.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
The changes just seem to
occur in the nature of time.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a kind of genesis,
a process of maturation,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
elimination through death

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that we have nothing
to say about.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The Hindus extended this
cyclic phase to everything

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.510 align:middle line:10%
They said that
everything is inherently

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:10%
dominated and created by time.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.318 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
The Kali Yuga is the crone,
which Shiva holds in his arms

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:90%
as one of his aspects.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:10%
The triadic nature of
his feminine nature

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:10%
takes three forms; the virgin,
the mother, and the crone.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
The crone is called Kali,
and Kali is the name

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:90%
for the concluding yuga.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the term
yuga straight.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Yuga is a term
which superficially

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:90%
means turning around.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.270 align:middle line:90%
It means rotating.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The yuga has a variation
from just turning,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
because every sphere that turns
throughout the entire universe

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
that is spinning has a
specific weight, density, size,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and other characteristics
that caused that turning

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:90%
to emit a specific sound.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The combination of the movement
and the sound that it emits

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:90%
is yuga.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:90%
That's what yuga means.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:84%
These sounds
saturate the expanse

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.730 align:middle line:90%
of the ether of the universe.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
When they collide,
they interface.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:90%
They intermix.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And when these colliding
forces of sonic energy

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
permeating the ether of
the universe come together,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.020 align:middle line:90%
they form a specific density.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:84%
That densification of sound
is what we call substance.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Yuga is a huge term, not only
in terms of the measure of time,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of the entire
formation of the universe.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Kali is mother of the finality
of the yuga system, and says,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I am Kali, mother and
creator of all these worlds.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I have a tendency
to destroy them.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
we have popularized.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:10%
It is known that Kali Yuga, the
crone of the feminine of Shiva,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:10%
brings about
massive destruction.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's outline the nature and
the form of the yuga system

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
so we can begin to see it as
a totality of the whole nature

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
of time, not just
what we're all aware

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
of as the destructive
aspect of time,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
which we all have to experience
as individuals at death.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
The yuga cycle has
been written down

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
for at least 6,000
years in southern India

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and transmitted through
all these time periods.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.310 align:middle line:84%
You think of all
the upheavals that

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
have occurred in the world,
the Earth, the climate,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and somehow, people hung
on to this teaching.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The yuga is a duration
that has been known

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and has been kept secret for
a very long period of time.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of
fact, anyone who's

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:10%
ever looked it up in most of
the books that have been printed

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:10%
on it have looked
at a chart that

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:10%
holds an intentional
falsification

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:10%
of the duration of the yugas.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The falsification happened
when the Aryan culture

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:90%
invaded India.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:84%
They took over a lot
of the knowledge that

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
was held by the
Dravidian population, who

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:84%
inhabited the Indus Valley
at the time of the invasion.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
They drove the Dravidians
south and caused

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the worst genocides
in history and prehistory.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The duration of the yuga
was kept in Dravidian books.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:10%
And some of those books wound
up in the Theosophical library

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:10%
in Madras.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:10%
A French Indologist by
the name of Alain Danielou

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:10%
lived in India for
20 years and became

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:10%
associated with the
Nehru family and a lot

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:10%
of the powerful people in India.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:10%
They said Danielou spoke
exquisite Sanskrit.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And he also to the same degree
was able to learn and speak

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Dravidian.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Somehow this knowledge about
Alain's linguistic ability

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
circulated through the
sadhus, the wandering saints

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and holy men of India.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
One of them came to
him and said, Alain,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
it is time that the true
durations of the yugas

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
become known.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
He gave Alain the name
of the text, but not

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:90%
the actual duration.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:10%
And so Alain had to find
the text which contained

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:10%
the duration of the yuga.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to believe that
this is the correct duration.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
There are many people
who may disagree

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
with the number we
are going to give you,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
but we will show
you the background

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
so you know the source
of the information that

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.490 align:middle line:90%
is to be given.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
We will be attempting to
enter into the way Egypt

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and India imprinted the key
essence of the yuga system.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:10%
This is also found
in Stonehenge.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
There are yuga definitions
within the placement of stones

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and the movement of
light in relationship

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to those monuments.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll get through all
of that as we go along.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
First, we want to deal with
numbers as representative

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of powers and functions that are
inherent in the natural world

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:90%
and in the human psyche.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the reasoning,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:84%
or we could say the
rationale, for the yuga

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
as a number in time
that is explicitly

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:84%
involved in the
creation and destruction

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.620 align:middle line:90%
cycles of the Earth.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The fivefold system
is the progression

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
that is active in form.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the major
progressions of numbers

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
that we live with.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Five is the number from
which our understanding

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:90%
of the golden mean is generated.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a method of
proportioning the growth

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.170 align:middle line:90%
of plants and animals.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the series
of numbers that is

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
dominant in the
expression of form.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:10%
There's a wonderful
Indian quote on this idea,

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:10%
and it goes, the divinity in his
act of externalizing his being,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:10%
in the form of creation, becomes
so enthralled and bewildered

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:10%
with his own beauty,
and in that transmit,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:10%
he feverishly creates
and devours everything

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:10%
that he created.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Puranas,
the ancient texts of India,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
say that, hunger is life,
and hunger is death,

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and hunger is the lord and
master of these worlds.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The eater while
eating is being eaten.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
That's really a
number philosophy,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
because with everything
that is created,

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:90%
there is a continual devouring.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
This is going on in our
own body every moment.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly in a state in
which cells are being composed

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:90%
and cells are being decomposed.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It all is happening fired
by the spark of devouring.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We all live by devouring
the life of other beings

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and other creatures
and other things.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the nature
of the universe

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.520 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
To deal with it in terms
of duration and form,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
it is necessary to use
two languages in parallel;

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
one of words and the
other of numbers.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:90%
The yugas exist with sets of 10.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
That group of 10 is called
the kalpa or a mahakalpa.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It is a group of 10
that defines four ages.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
This can be made into a diagram
such as a tetractys This

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
is one of the diagrams that
Pythagoras got from Egypt

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:90%
and said was a sacred diagram.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Sacred means permanent or fixed.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying that this
tetractys is a permanent design

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
or structure inherent
throughout creation.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It is a preexistent
configuration,

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
which precedes the coming
into being of the created

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:90%
or manifest world.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
A key definitional relationship
in Hindu philosophy

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
is the difference between
existence and manifestation.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Existence is an
immaterial configuration

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:84%
that must have been
created and conceived

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
prior to the beginning
of the manifest creation.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:90%
Existence is the home of time.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Time and the laws of time must
preexist the laws of space.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Space is where form, the formed,
and the manifest world occurs.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not the relationship
of time and space

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:90%
that we began with.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:90%
It's consciousness.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:84%
It has no hierarchical
value, but consciousness does

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:90%
precede the activity of space.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you can conceive
of the existence of time

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
without space, but you cannot
conceive of the existence

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:90%
of space without time.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Here is the tetractys inverted.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It is a series of numbers
that starts with 1,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.520 align:middle line:90%
then 3, then 6, then 10.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
triangular number series,

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.560 align:middle line:90%
and this can go on indefinitely.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:90%
It also denotes four levels.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these levels
is one of the four ages

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:90%
that are contained in a kalpa.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the mahakalpa.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about the
duration of the yuga.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
This was once so secret that
it was hidden by the Dravidian

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
During the Aryan
invasion, it was

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
hidden in books only in
the Dravidian language.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not to say that
the invaders didn't gain access

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
to it and keep these
secrets for themselves.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the culture that controls
most of the world's governments

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:84%
is now using the
knowledge of the yugas

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:84%
for beneficial and
favorable moments in time.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.890 align:middle line:84%
If so, they're using
this information

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.319 align:middle line:84%
to bring about any of
their desired movements

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:90%
in their controls over society.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.440 align:middle line:84%
What we're working on now is
to extend this as a theory

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can
verify some of its value

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
as a process of determining
long durations of a cycle.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you the number that
was held secret for so long.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a strange number, but we
will have time in this series

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to give you a good sampling
of why one could conjecture

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
that this is a very valid piece
of genuine gnostic awareness.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
With this tetractys, we
can see that the four

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:90%
ages are comprised of 10 yugas.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:10%
The duration of one
yuga is 6,048 years.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:10%
If you know the
measurements of the Earth,

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:10%
this number is very important.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a series
of numbers that

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:84%
begins with 54, which is two
times the cube of 3, 54, 108,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
216, 432, 864, and so on.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
864 times 7 equals 6,048, which
is the duration of one yuga.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Many of the numbers
in this series

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
represent various
central measurements

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, the
sun, and the moon.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we just multiply
one of these numbers, 216,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
by 10, we can find 2,160,
which is the diameter

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:90%
of the moon in miles.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a measurement of space.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.620 align:middle line:84%
It's also the duration
of time that it

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
takes the sun in its
processional cycle

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to pass through one
sign of the zodiac.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:90%
That's 2,160 years.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the metric system,
the English miles system

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
is directly related to the way
the ancients measured space.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
The inch, the foot,
the yard, and the mile

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.510 align:middle line:84%
are all based on ancient
measuring systems

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:90%
with deeply sacred roots.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Every number in this series
are multiples of 6, 3, and 9,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:90%
which are all multiples of 3.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:90%
They are creative.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are the numbers which
are found by the people who

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
developed the yuga philosophy
as the key to the solution,

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as the composition
of the universe.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The sun is also dominated
by these numbers.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Its movements around the zodiac,
its relationship to the Earth

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:84%
are denoted by numbers which
are involved with three and six.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Seven is the number
that dominates

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:90%
the cycles of the moon.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Within this we have the combined
interaction of the greatest

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:84%
forces on Earth, the forces
that create all the tides,

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
not only in the ocean, but
the flowing of our blood

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:90%
through our body.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything that moves
tidally moves in combination

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
with the effects of
the sun and moon.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.915 align:middle line:84%
And these are systems
based on seven and six.

00:19:59.915 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
By understanding
the yuga cycles,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
we can see that
time, like space,

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:90%
has dimensional qualities.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
In our next episode,
we will further

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
our examination
of the yuga cycles

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.905 align:middle line:84%
and the ramifications of
these cycles on human history.

00:20:18.905 --> 00:20:29.142 align:middle line:90%
