00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:08.398 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There are three levels
that are under the regulation

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:84%
of the periodicity of 14
and its division into 1000.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Those three levels are
the spiritual development

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
of man, the intellectual
development, and the body.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The body is verified by
the seven meridians that

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:90%
run down the front of the body.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
If we turn this figure around,
there are seven more down

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:90%
the back for a total of 14.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:84%
14 for the body, 14 for the
mind, and 14 for the spirit--

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
this number is also an
aspect of the manvantara.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It takes 14 manvantaras to
make up a single kalpa or one

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:90%
day of Brahma.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
If we look back to
the relationship

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
of the palm and the four digits
being the measure through which

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
we construct the
whole figure of man,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
we can determine that
the cerebral cortex

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:90%
has a digit value of 0.7305.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
If you multiply that number
by two, you get 1.461.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Removing the decimal
point, this in years

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is the exact cycle of
Sirius, which is 1,461 years.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
That is how long it takes
Sirius to complete one cycle.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:84%
If you multiply 0.7305
by 50, you get 36.525.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Move the decimal one
place to the right,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
exact time in days

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.940 align:middle line:84%
it takes for the
earth to complete

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:90%
one solar cycle, 365.25 days.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
We are beginning to acknowledge
our connection to Sirius.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's spelled out in the
width of the finger, which

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
is the basic unit of measure
chosen by Egyptian culture who

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
were the first people to record
the movement and relationship

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:90%
between the sun and Sirius.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
It is all spelled out
in the hand of man.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.390 align:middle line:84%
There's an Egyptian
wall painting

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:90%
of the death of Osiris.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:90%
He is encircled by a serpent.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:10%
On his body are black and white
checks, of which there are 28.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:10%
Osiris is the human form
that lives and develops

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:10%
through a sevenfold,
14-fold system

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:10%
and goes through stages
as a species of death

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:10%
and rebirth of his formation.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The numerology of
7 and 14 is also

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
present with Egyptian
images of Osiris.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Mythologically, Osiris
represents the human species.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
He is the deity which represents
the entirety of our species.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:10%
In this Egyptian image,
we see a deceased Osiris

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:10%
that represents the end
of the human species.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:10%
From him, 28 shoots
of wheat germinate,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:10%
representing a new seeding.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:10%
These are being watered by
a man with a vase, which

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:10%
is the symbol of Aquarius--

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:10%
the same symbols for the
zodiac still being used today.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Osiris lays on a platform,
which has five ankhs

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:10%
and 10 was scepters.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:10%
The was is a staff with
a dog's head, which very

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:10%
often symbolizes the dog star.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It also symbolizes Anubis,
the guardian of the gateway

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:90%
to the dead.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The ankh is the symbol of life
and the reunification of life.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:10%
There are 15 symbols in total.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:10%
If you add the five ankhs
with the 10 was scepters,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:10%
this symbolizes Osiris
going through the death

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:10%
of one phase of our species
and a process of time.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:84%
It is suggested in the
Puranas concerning the Yugas

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
that the human species is
manifest for a period of 60,000

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Then, that manifest stage
goes into a dormancy,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
a sort of mummification,
where the energy

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.420 align:middle line:84%
for another round
of its development

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:90%
requires another 60,000 years.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It will also take 60,000
years for the Earth

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:90%
to rejuvenate itself.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Here is another
image of Osiris that

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:84%
continues our mythological
investigation, which

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.890 align:middle line:84%
we are using as a
key to interpret

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:90%
the duration of the Yuga.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It is a depiction
of a philosophy

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:90%
that is called the Lion's Path.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It is an initiatory
process of going through 14

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:90%
stages of initiation.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
The Lion's Path is a metaphor
for the 14 levels of energy

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
that each soul is believed to
pass through as it approaches

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:90%
its incarnation on Earth.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It passes through
them again after death

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:90%
and during post-mortem.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those 14
levels is a passage

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:10%
through a particular
vibration which

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:10%
emanates from a constellation, a
star, or a planetary vibration.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
The star which imparts
vibration to the development

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
of the human soul and
its sentient incarnation

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.225 align:middle line:90%
is the star Sirius.

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Then, there are 13 planets.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
The first is one that is
questioned in our time, resides

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:90%
beyond the orbit of Pluto--

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.800 align:middle line:84%
which we will call Vulcan,
the invisible planet.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Then, we have Pluto,
Neptune, Uranus, and Chiron,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
which are all part of the
breakup of a previous planet.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Next, is Saturn, Jupiter,
Xerxes, Mars, the sun, Mercury,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Venus, Earth and the moon.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
All of these represent
the 14 levels of vibration

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.580 align:middle line:84%
which contribute
to the formation

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
They are called the
14 Amulets of Osiris.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And those energies
are gathered up

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
in a particular proportion
for each individual birth.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And they are dispersed
back to the previous level

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:90%
upon the soul's journey out.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There are three
dimensions of space

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:90%
and three durations of time.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, everything that
enters into the manifest world

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:90%
must adhere to the law of three.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
in the physical world

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:90%
as two dimensions.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
physical manifestation

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
has height, width,
and a thickness.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
No matter how thin
that thickness may be,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing that
does not have thickness.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the prerequisite
of the manifest world.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
We symbolize a two-dimensional
world with drawings.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And we think about
it so we can conceive

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%
of a two-dimensional reality.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But for it to
manifest, it must be 3D

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and must have a time duration
of either beginning, middle,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and end, or before,
during, and after.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:84%
These are the three
dimensions of time.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:90%
These are the prerequisites.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.340 align:middle line:90%
That's how our life is arranged.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the requirement.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Three dimensions
and three durations

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:84%
is the requirement
of a manifest being.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
That is the difference between
existence and manifestation.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
There are things that
exist that are unmanifest.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras specified that in
terms of the world of number,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.660 align:middle line:84%
there are whole numbers
belonging to the manifest

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And the world of
irrational numbers,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that is a world of unresolvable
continual decimals.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember, all the roots of the
key numbers are irrational.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:90%
They exist.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:90%
They have an existence.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But they do not have
a manifestation.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.680 align:middle line:90%
They exist only in the mind.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The mind conceives in the
two-dimensional world.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And it perceives in the
three-dimensional world.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:84%
This is very important to
understand about the way

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
we think because we must
make that differentiation--

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.710 align:middle line:84%
what really exists and
what is actually manifest.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Three dimensions plus duration
creates a fourfold reality.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is the nature of the
manifest world, the number 4.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the division you have
to have in the manifest world--

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
four directions or orientations
because it's occurring

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:90%
in both space and times.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:90%
The square root of 3 is 1.72.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And then, it goes on infinitely.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not perceivable.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
It's not reducible
to whole numbers.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
3 is.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Its root isn't.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Very often, all the
key formative numbers

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
of sound and embodiment
have an irrational root

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:90%
that it belongs to.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything in
manifestation adheres

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:90%
to the law of before and after.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's implicit
in the three durations.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
This is the idea of death.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Something begins,
and something ends.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
The purely existent
world does not

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.190 align:middle line:90%
have a beginning or an ending.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:84%
No matter whatever
happens, wherever

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:84%
there is a manifestation
of three of anything,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.135 align:middle line:84%
it has a root that
will exist forever.

00:09:14.135 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:84%
In Indian philosophy, they
associate the existent level

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
as being the domain of time,
while the manifest level

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
requires a space,
a spatial location.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
For space to be manifest, for
it to be a determined space,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
it needs to adhere
to four directions.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Space has the requirements
of back and front, left

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
and right, top and bottom.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
with space, you always

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:90%
have an inside and an outside.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Once you fulfill
those requirements,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:90%
you're in a manifest world.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Space's domain is the
manifest and time, which

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:90%
is something that we measure.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But we never really
know what it is exists.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a realm that
is not manifest but exists.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot imagine a
manifestation that does not

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
preexist or have its
elements preexist.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Yuga system
is the primary teaching found

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:90%
in India.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
They do not give a hierarchical
priority to time and space.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But they give it a
successional priority.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Time and the
structuring of time must

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.430 align:middle line:84%
occur before there is any
structuring and space.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the key
phrases in the Puranas

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
is, "only that which
has a manifest existence

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:90%
has a space which also exists."

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:84%
We separate ourselves
from our space,

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.510 align:middle line:90%
and we call it the ecology.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
What's good or bad
for the environment

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:90%
is directly good or bad for us.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We suffer every pollution
and every disturbance

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%
found in the environment.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Every destruction that is
inflicted on the environment,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:84%
we experience in the physiology
and metabolism of the body.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's do a little more
number workings with 6,408.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
We have looked at the division
of 6,408 by 7, which is 864.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So right away, we are into
that progression of numbers

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
that we began to talk
about in the first episode.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.150 align:middle line:84%
2,160 is the moon's
diameter in miles.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And half of that is 1,080.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:90%
And half of that is 540.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
All significant
measures and units

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:84%
in the size of the Earth,
the moon, and in time

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:90%
begin with 27.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:90%
27 is 3 cubed.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So that is the triadic
nature of time and space

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
when it takes on a volume and
enters the physical world.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It generates the numbers, which
control the time and space

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:90%
formations.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
If we take all these numbers and
simply switch the zero around,

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
2,160 becomes 2,016.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:90%
4,320 becomes 4,032.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:10%
And 8,640 becomes 8,064.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:10%
All of these numbers exist
in a ratio of 14 to 15.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:90%
2,016 over 14 equals 144.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
2,160 over 15 equals 144.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:90%
4,032 over 14 equals 288.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:90%
4,320 over 15 equals 288.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:90%
8,064 over 14 equals 576.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:90%
8,640 over 15 equals 576.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:10%
In John Michell and Robin
Heath's study of Stonehenge,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:10%
they found that the
thickness of the stones

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:10%
in the outer circle
compared to the inner circle

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:10%
has a ratio of 15 to 14.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Just so we don't feel
that this is coincidental,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
if we divide 6,048
by 9, you get 672,

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and then by 2, you get 336.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:90%
336 equals exactly 6 times 56.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And 56 is the number of holes
found at the Aubrey Circle

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:90%
at Stonehenge.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So it begins to
become doubtless.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's a
megalithic measure

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
that places these 56
holes, so that they

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:90%
are 108 megalithic units apart.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%
56 times 108 equals 6,048.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the duration
of the Kali Yuga.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%
All these key dimensions of 108
go back to 54, which is 2 times

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:90%
3 cubed.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
As we showed with
the palm of the hand,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:84%
our entire perceiving, hearing,
and articulation process

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:90%
occurs in the first four palms.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
There is research that recognize
that the human voice can

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
differentiate exactly
54 different tones.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The human speaking and
articulating structure

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
can enunciate exactly
54 phonemes or sounds.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Our speech and our
hearing are all

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
keyed into the dimensions
and movements of the Earth.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They are extensions
of the same power

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:90%
inherent in these numbers.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Twice the three levels of
existence cubed made manifest.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you get a cube,
that's the manifest world.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:90%
54 to 56 is 27 to 28.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It's all built into Stonehenge.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Its builders knew enough of
how to symbolically set up

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
all of the stones in
these relationships.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the
astronomical events

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
dictated the architectural
choices, not the other way.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
They didn't build it
in order to observe it.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like they knew it.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed them to
know how to build it--

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
because you couldn't
set up an observatory

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
like that unless you knew
what you wanted to observe.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
You didn't set it
up and discover,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, the sun sets here,
so we put the rocks here.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
To move those rocks
from that distance

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and not know exactly
what they wanted to count

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is preposterous
because they wanted

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:84%
to know where they were in
time, not what time it was.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:90%
That was already known.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It is through the understanding
of these sacred numbers

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that we began to know how the
universe came into existence

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:90%
and manifested itself.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
