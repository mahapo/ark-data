00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> In this episode, we
continue with our examination

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:90%
of the Yuga Cycles and history.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Looking back at the tetractys,
each one of these dots

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
then equals the
duration of 6,048 years.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Multiplied by 10, we
see the entire mahakalpa

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:90%
has a value of 60,480 years.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at why
we have the Yuga system

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:90%
as the inverted tetractys.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The first age is the
Golden Age, and has

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
a duration of four Yugas,
which is 24,192 years.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
The second age, is
called the Silver Age,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
is a duration of three
Yugas, which is 18,144 years.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
The Copper or Bronze
Age had a duration

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
of to Yugas, which
is 12,096 years.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And the age that we are
in now, the Kali Yuga,

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:90%
has the duration of 1 Yuga--

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:90%
6,048 years.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
With the declining of the
number of Yugas per age,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
our perception of
time also diminishes.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
The sense of time
in the Golden Age

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
was experienced as
a much longer time

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
because everyone born into
an age is a part of that age.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
wonder of childhood.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us can remember how
time was so much bigger and so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
much longer when
we were children.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
That is true of tribal men and
earlier indigenous cultures.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel the pressure and
anxiety of a shortage of time.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But in the Kali Yuga, we do have
a sense of a shortage of time,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
because we are all the
children of Mahakali,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
who states, "I created
all these worlds,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.255 align:middle line:90%
and I tend to destroy them."

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:23.050 align:middle line:84%
We live with that sense,
whether we know it or not,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.000 align:middle line:84%
because we are
part of an age that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:84%
brings about the ending
of a great process

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:90%
of human development.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We should think about this
in sort of an embryology.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
We are part of the birth
giving of the anthropocosm.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
This means that humanity is,
and is aware, and is conscious,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
We are just one stage in
the birth of that being--

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
the anthropocosm.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:10%
This is not evolution, as
this growth is cyclical.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:10%
It's not the nature of laws
of adaptation and struggle

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:10%
and survival.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the laws inherent in
the intention of the creation

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:90%
of a time-space universe.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
It's there from the
beginning, and it is ours

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
if we can see it to its final
and glorious conclusion.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we are
in the Kali Yuga.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The Puranas were some of the
most ancient texts from India.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that each
Yuga is preceded by a phase

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:90%
that they call the dawn.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.555 align:middle line:84%
And it is concluded by a
phase they call the twilight.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Just like the birth
of a day or a year,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
all cycles are simply an
expansion of the same cycle.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are all interdependent
on a cycle of the Earth, which

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
is 365 days.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
We will come to
connect the duration

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of the journey of the
Earth around the Sun

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:90%
to this larger cycle.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Just like the
cycle of the Earth,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:84%
it manifests in this
triangular triad of dawn.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
First is the central
region of time.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Next is the body of
the day or night.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:90%
And finally, twilight.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:10%
It is that constant
progression-- dawn, Yuga,

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:10%
twilight, dawn, Yuga,
twilight-- which

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.990 align:middle line:10%
takes us from Yuga to
Yuga and age to age.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Here we come to very
interesting variations

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.580 align:middle line:90%
on our basic number of 6,048.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
The Puranas specify
that the Yuga

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
is divided into 10
units, each one having

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
a particular
accomplishment in terms

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
of the process of the
unfolding of the divinity

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:90%
into this materialization.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
The durations of the dawn
and twilight are 504 years.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 of
these, which give us

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
a Yuga of 5,040
years, with a dawn 504

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
years and a twilight 504
years, with a total of 6,048.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:84%
504 for dawn, 5,040 as
a duration of the Yuga,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
504 for Twilight,
and 6,048 in total.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
This is very important for
us to know because these are

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:90%
divisions within historic time.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:84%
All the Yuga are the
same, except they

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
come in different multiples
to form the ages--

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to form the four
great ages of man.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Our modern Gregorian
calendar may

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
have been created by someone
who was conscious or aware

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Yuga dates.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Because of the synchronicity
with the Yuga system,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
our calendar became
consistently parallel

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
with the Hindu calendar.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Both our calendar and the
ancient Indian calendar

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
denote the beginning of
the Kali Yuga in 3102 BC.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of the
last Yuga of a 60,000 year

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically, we can locate
the dawn of that cycle.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Simply add 504 four years
before 3102, which is 3606 BC.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
When did we go into the
twilight of our age?

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
That day came in
roughly 1938 to 1939.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
That is when the formulas
for the nuclear bomb

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:90%
were finalized.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
That's when Hitler
moved into Poland

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and provoke the
Second World War.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
There are numerous
historic events

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
which happened in the beginning
of the shadow of twilight.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
From this point on, we descend
to the finality of the Kali

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Yuga we can see that the dawn of
the Kali Yuga began in 3606 BC,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and the very end of the
twilight of the Kali Yuga

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:90%
will end in 2442 AD.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
We can utilize these dates to
describe different events which

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
go right down to the duration
of the multiples of 7,

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
which are the key fundamental
of the Yuga system.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at another
series of numbers.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:12.562 align:middle line:84%
1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times
5 times 6 times 7 equals 5,040.

00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
7 times 8 times 9 times
10 also equals 5,040.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
In other words, 7
is the very heart

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
of the generation
of the Yuga number.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Is that a fortuitous
circumstance,

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
or is that the fact that
the number is an aspect

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of time?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Hindu philosophy considered time
to be the mind of the universe.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the aspect of
the universe that

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
carries clear and
exact numeric values

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and descriptive durations.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Coming back to historical
events related to the Yuga,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
if we add 7 to 1938,
we get 1945, when

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:90%
they dropped the atomic bomb.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the same year
the United Nations was

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:90%
founded as a one world order.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Seven years later, 1952 was
the date they began research

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.020 align:middle line:90%
into biological weapons.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:84%
It was Eisenhower who wanted
a large amount of money

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:90%
spent on biological weapons.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
We start to see the continuous
shadow of the decomposing

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:90%
functions of the Yuga.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
These shadows of
human history are

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the nature of
time and the necessity

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
of having a continuous creation
that experiences birth, death,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:90%
and rebirth.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back to
tetractys diagram

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:84%
because it is the archetype
of not only time but space.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
This is why the tetractys
was the great teaching

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
tool of the entire
Pythagorean legacy.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras called
it a sacred diagram,

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and that it is a
permanent representation

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:90%
of the factuality of creation.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras, unlike
Plato and Aristotle,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:90%
was not an equational thinker.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
He was a proportional thinker.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
He saw one thing as in
relation to another,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:84%
in the same or similar
way that something else is

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
in relationship
to another thing.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
proportional thinking.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The circle of time of the Yugas
implies the differentiation

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
of our reality into four
aspects or qualities.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
We are going to run through some
of the characteristics of each

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
of the four ages and
align them with some

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
of the most basic ways that we
define our individual being.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Four ways of individuation
are the four stages of life.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Childhood, adolescence,
adulthood, and old age.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Each age is equal
to a stage of life

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:90%
within each living organism.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:84%
In organized civilizations,
there are four castes.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
People are cast by their
vocational aptitudes,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and those four castes are the
priests and scholars, which

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
are called Brahmins; the
royalty, the kings and princes,

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:84%
called the Kshatriya; the
merchants and bankers, known

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
as the Vaishyas; and
the fourth, the Shudra,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:90%
which is the working class.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:84%
The people who manipulate,
successfully and creatively,

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:90%
the material world.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
The Shudra is, of course,
the largest caste.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But each caste
dominates during an age.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Each stage of life is a
dominant stage during the four

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
ages of the Yugas.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:84%
There are also four forms
of sexual expression.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We have the feminine-feminine,
the masculine-masculine,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
the masculine
within the feminine,

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine
within the masculine.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:84%
The variations become dominant
principles in successive ages.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
There are also four
major cultures.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
There's the nomadic hunter and
gatherer, the nomadic herding

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
people, horticultural people,
and, finally, the urban settled

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
populations, which
incorporate and control

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:90%
all of the other attributes.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, each
one of us as an individual

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
is, and has to participate, in
each one of these categories

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:90%
of identity.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The four ages, or
Yugas, are also

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
similar to the four
seasons of the year.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We can start with the first
culture, the first age,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:90%
the Golden Age, the longest age.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the springtime
of our species.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The cultural form at
that time is nomadic

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:90%
hunting and gathering.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
This is really the golden
age of our physicality

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
and our intelligence.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:90%
Time itself was slower.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Days and years stretched
forever in the Golden Age.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Because the earth and soil
were filled with minerals,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the plants that humans ate
had much higher amounts

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of natural vitamins, nutritional
substances, and amino acids

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
than the plants we
eat today, which

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:56.750 align:middle line:84%
need chemicals and genetic
processing to grow.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Of all the cultures
on Earth today,

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
one of the closest to the
hunter-gatherer cultures

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Golden Age are the
Aborigines of Australia.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Robert Lawlor did an
intensive investigation

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
into that culture, which
resulted in his classic book,

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.160 align:middle line:90%
"Voices of the First Day."

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Australian Aborigines
have incredible linguistic

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:90%
capabilities.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.020 align:middle line:84%
They had knowledge and memory
of thousands of species.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
They memorized their relatives
and ancestors all the way back

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:90%
for many generations.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
They had a sensing of where
they were in time and space

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
at every moment that we
do not possess anymore.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:10%
In terms of the
intelligence that

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:10%
nurtures the independence
of the physical organism,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:10%
that is the Golden Age of man.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
We have an intelligence
that breeds

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
dependency of our physical
being and manifestation.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.400 align:middle line:84%
The golden age was
when mankind was

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
free in a world where
they respected the earth

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:90%
and wandered freely.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
They fulfilled more
than any cultural form.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason why the Earth
was created in the first place.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostic myths
of Sophia tell us

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that Sophia was a
formative energy force

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the galaxy.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
She, on her own
volition, decided

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
to sacrifice her
being as a force

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
in order to become
a habitat, a womb,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
for a creature who would
be able to observe,

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:84%
to perceive, and conceive
the wonders of the universe

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that we're being produced
in the mind of the all.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:10%
That culture is the
indigenous free culture,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:10%
because they constantly
wandered around

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:10%
in the unfettered, undisturbed
beauty of the natural world,

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.780 align:middle line:10%
and learned everything through
their perception of creation.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
The sexualities in the golden
age are feminine-feminine.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Not the emphasis of the feminine
within the masculine, which

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is what dominates the priest
caste the third age, the Copper

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Age, nor the masculine
within the feminine, which

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.035 align:middle line:84%
dominates the urban world of the
modern age, or the Kali Yuga.

00:14:00.035 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Age was
a casteless society.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But of the castes
as we know them,

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:90%
they represented the Shudra.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:84%
That was the age where
the people of the Earth--

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:90%
and of the hand-- dominated.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the age where we learned
symbolism, sacred geometry,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and the physical
emphasis of the universe.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:90%
The tribal form predominated.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
In the later ages,
the Shudra would

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
have to be captured to be drawn
into the hierarchical system

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:90%
of cities.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
We'll put the second
age, the Silver Age,

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
at the opposite pole
in terms of caste.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
The aristocracy of the
four castes, the royalty,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
ruled the second
Yuga, the Silver Age.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:84%
This was the age in which
they invented kingship,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and the age where such values as
honor and courage were kindled.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The aristocracy,
especially in Egypt,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
with the invention of
the king and queen,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.540 align:middle line:84%
represented the highest
evolution of the people

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And they had the responsibility
for the continuation of memory.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what the kings
and the pharaohs were.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:84%
They were the guardians
of the truth of history,

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and protectors of the behavior
and ethics of a culture.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:84%
They carried the ka from
one generation to another.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:84%
The ka is an aspect of the
soul in Egyptian mythology.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
We will describe the
ka in greater detail

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:84%
in later episodes
of this series.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The sexuality of this age
would be masculine-masculine.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Of the four cultures,
it would also

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
be the beginning of
the agricultural phase.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The eating of naturally
produced foods was ending,

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and now humans were no longer
free to wander the earth.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Now the earth had to be tilled.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.285 align:middle line:84%
Man was turned from
a hunter to a farmer.

00:15:55.285 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:10%
It's recorded in the Puranas
that when the second age came

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:10%
to end, the aristocracy
had become so degenerate

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:10%
that the Brahmins,
the priest class,

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:10%
murdered the complete
aristocratic caste.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Only a very few royal
bloodlines escaped,

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and this is how the priest
took control in the third age.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
Copper or Bronze Age.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The sexuality of
the priesthood class

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
is the feminine
within the masculine.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The priest dominated
the entire third age.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Egypt and India both
went through this phase.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
This genocide is clearly
marked in Hindu texts,

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
when the priest caste, through
poisoning and subterfuge,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%
got rid of the kings.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Plato said that
in the second age

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:90%
there was a three-caste society.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But the merchants split off from
the Shudras in the second day

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
when they started kingdoms.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:90%
The Shudra owned the Golden Age.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.180 align:middle line:84%
The aristocracy
led the second age.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
The priests and scholars
had the third age.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth age, we
find ourselves dominated

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:90%
by the mercantile class.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
In the Iron Age, we are actually
in the old age of culture.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
The decrepitness and
dependency that we

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
have nurtured through
consumerism is self-evident.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.099 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens as we age.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We become more and more
dependent upon devices

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%
to aid us as our health fails.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:84%
In the Golden Age,
time seems forever.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in the Iron
Age, in the Kali Yuga,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.020 align:middle line:90%
time seems to be speeding up.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Every second seems
shorter than the last one.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Days and nights fly by.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lifetime feels
like a mere moment.

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:10%
Corporatism is the
merchant class gone wild.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
The Iron Age is dominated
by the Vaishyas--

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.600 align:middle line:90%
the merchant caste.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
In terms of seasons,
spring is the Golden Age,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
summer is the Silver
Age, fall the Copper Age,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:90%
and the winter is the Iron Age.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Within each age, each
one of the castes

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:90%
has a period of strength.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.450 align:middle line:84%
The whole cycle of
four repeats itself

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
within each of the four castes,
cultures, and sexuality.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
The cultural essence
of the Kali Yuga

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:84%
has taken place
in America, where

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
they have turned everything,
every aspect of life,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:90%
into a commodity.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Even water is sold
as a commodity.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
ritual sacrifice,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:84%
where the species is
given all the material

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
gifts and advantages that once
was held by the aristocracy

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:90%
through the means of commerce.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
The people, the Shudra,
can accumulate more wealth

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
than all of the kings and
princes held in previous ages.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what was in the
prophecies concerning the Kali

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Yuga, where the poor want to
sleep in the beds of princes.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.450 align:middle line:10%
The Vaishya, the merchants,
with the excesses of commerce,

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.000 align:middle line:10%
provides the sacrificial
ritual component

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.490 align:middle line:10%
of the end of the age.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.860 align:middle line:84%
He who is to be
sacrificed is to be

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:90%
raised to the level of a king.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Also, it consumes itself.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
That can only happen
through the Vaishya,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
through the domination of
the world by corporations,

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that the organism has to consume
itself at the end of the cycle.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The sexuality of the Iron Age is
masculine inside the feminine.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
The whole business world
has caused the feminization

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine, and is
actually a feminine force

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.680 align:middle line:84%
that dominates it,
because our world now

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is one of protection
and security overall.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Fear of death and overpopulation
are the attributes of this.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are
looking at a collection

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
of archetypal
characteristics associated

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
with femininity because it's
not really the manifest form.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:90%
It's the archetypal form.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
The archetypal feminine
is being served,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and the masculine has
been absorbed within it.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.240 align:middle line:84%
This is why a concern for the
material world and for safety

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:84%
are what concerns
our age the most.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we mentioned that
we have been conditioned

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.930 align:middle line:84%
into a language based on an
egalitarian or equivalency

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:28.310 align:middle line:84%
pattern, which keeps our
thinking on a linear basis.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.000 align:middle line:84%
We just go from 2
plus 3 equals 5.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
We ignore that each one of the
numerical symbols that we've

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:84%
utilized for this are
not mere quantities.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.010 align:middle line:84%
There are concepts,
which imply imagery,

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
which imply philosophical
ideas like duality, trinity,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.310 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to
shift our thinking

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in this discussion of the
proportional system that

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is embedded in the
very nature of time.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.500 align:middle line:84%
To fully derive value
from this exercise,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
we want to also try to
stretch our thinking so

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:90%
that it is multi-layered.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, to reveal this
connection between mathematics

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:84%
and mythology, we can go to
a number of the Yuga, 6,048,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and we find that the square
root of this number is 77.77.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a perfect example
of how a quantity begins

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:84%
to expand into astronomy and
the movement of the Earth

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
into the symbolic code that's
embedded in the simplest series

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:90%
of a succession of numbers.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:90%
It's four sevens.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And this number
embodies four ages.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:10%
As you learn to look for
layers in our evaluation

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:10%
of simple quantities, we
will be able to uncover

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:10%
more and more of
the symbolism that

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.290 align:middle line:10%
is held in the Yuga system.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:90%
