00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The five-fold system is
the progression that is active

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:90%
in form.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the major
progressions of numbers

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:90%
that we live with.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Five is the number from
which our understanding

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:90%
of the golden mean is generated.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:84%
This is a method of
proportioning the growth

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of plants and animals.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's the series
of numbers that is

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:84%
dominant in the
expression of form.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:84%
We have another
progression of eight

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that is dominant in the
expression of vibration.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Successions of five and eight
are two different lengths

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
that are both associated
with the two different levels

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of the creative process of
Nada Brahma, the world emerging

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:90%
from sound.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
To make that just a
little bit clearer,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
whenever you hear
a musical note,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
you are actually
hearing the interaction

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:90%
of two numbers as a ratio.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have a fundamental
note, this ratio is 1 over 1.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
The second note moving up
the major diatonic scale

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%
is 9 over 8.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what sound is.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a relationship
between numbers.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And all these numbers are
reducible to our first number,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:84%
the principle of the
duality and the emergence

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of the first form,
which is a triangle.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The number 10 is just another
phase of the unity as a number.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And its inverse
always equals 1 or 10.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
This is the unmanifest
phase of powers and energies

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
which were a preexistent
configuration

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
to the manifestation
of the world.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
The manifestation of the
world begins, then, with 10.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Then what we get is
a series of ratios

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that are particularly active
together as vibrations

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:90%
that produce sound.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
The first nine whole
numbers and their inverse

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
are all the powerful
harmonics of sound.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
These are the powers
of sound creating form.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
When you hear music, you hear
it and are responding to it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
because these
sounds are actually

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.210 align:middle line:84%
creating forms within
the cellular composition

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to
the birth of form.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the power that music has.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You're at the center
of the act of creation.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Those sounds are
created by a state

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
or being in relationship to
its own opposite-- oppositional

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.980 align:middle line:90%
progressions.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
The one non-harmonic
ratio in this series

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:90%
is the relationship of 7 to 3.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
While all these other ratios
are creative relationships,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
this one is the
relationship of destruction.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the way the creator
transforms his creation

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
through a process of
cyclic destruction.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be born and
reborn without going through

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
a disintegration of
the previous form.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the cyclic
necessity of the creation

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to have a time that both
creates and destroys.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Now as we have seen in our
little number exercise,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
a ratio is the comparison
of two numbers.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:84%
When this comparison happens
in a controlled release

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of vibration, you get sound.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And that sound
principle is the origin

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
of an evolution of substance
throughout the environment.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
This structure of
the seed is an analog

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of the basic tetractys,
which is also

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
the analog of the four ages and
10 yugas that carries forward

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:90%
the genesis of humanity.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
The containing ratio of
all sound, and therefore

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
all substance, is the ratio
of 1 to 2, the octave.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
This ratio is detectable
in every culture.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Every human that
has ever heard sound

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.310 align:middle line:84%
recognizes this as a
return to a new beginning.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.589 align:middle line:84%
That is what
generates a new scale.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
The scale starts
over in the octave.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why a musical scale is
contained within an octave.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that 1
equals 6 vibrations,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and 2 would equal 12 vibrations.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:10%
And then there are two notes
that are in between 6 and 12.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:10%
The two major
chords that make up

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:10%
all of the entire process of
harmony and harmonization,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:10%
whether it be in music
or in vibrations, that

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:10%
are in an atomic level
or on a molecular level

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:10%
would be sounding in harmony.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The 1 over here is equal to
3/4 and 2/3 of the 6 to 12.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And that would be 8 to 9.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
You can describe the principal
tones of the musical scale,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:90%
which has four numbers--

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:90%
6, 8, 9, and 12--

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
starting with the fundamental,
then the fourth, the fifth,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and then the octave.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
This principle of inversion is
what we represent with ratios.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.600 align:middle line:84%
A ratio of space, 9 to 8, will
sound and the inverse of 8 to 9

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and vice versa.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental is 1
over 1, which is 6 hertz.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The fourth is 4 over
3, which is 8 hertz.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The fifth is 3 over
2, which is 9 hertz.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And the octave is
2 over 1, 12 hertz.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:84%
In music, there is
this interconnection

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
between the divisions of
space and divisions of time.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Overlapping between
space and time

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
is what we'll be
investigating and discovering

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
throughout everything, our
exploration of the yuga system,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and also the measures
of the Earth.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:84%
As a single example of perhaps
hundreds of different harmonic

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:84%
ratios that are expressed
and actually form

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
the cohesion on a
level of consciousness,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
there is a ratio between the
orbit of the planet Mercury

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and the orbit of the Earth,
which is the ratio 4 to 1--

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
four orbits exactly to the
one orbit of the Earth.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
This is from a book,
"Cycles of Heaven,"

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that was compiled in relation
to astronomers that provided

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
the data on which they were able
to discover ancient knowledge

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:90%
inherent in the solar system.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Continuing again, the
orbit of the planet Mercury

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to the orbit of Venus
is the ratio of 5 to 2.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The orbit of Uranus to Mars is
exactly the ratio of 3 to 1.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
The orbit of Mars to
Jupiter is 6 to 1.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The orbit of Jupiter to
Saturn is again 5 to 2.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The orbit of Uranus and
Neptune is exactly an octave--

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:90%
2 to 1.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
The orbit of Neptune
to Pluto is exactly

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.100 align:middle line:90%
in musical fit of 3 to 2.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
Saturn was often

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
referred to as the "outer sun."

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
planets were believed

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.730 align:middle line:84%
to actually be held between the
forces of the sun and Saturn.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a very interesting
relationship between the planet

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Saturn and our moon.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
The moon has a rotation
cycle of 29.5 days, which

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
is a transposition of the exact
number of years of the Saturn

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:90%
cycle, 29.5 years.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
These are the forces that
hold the universe together.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And these are also
the forces that

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
are represented in the Trinity
of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
where Brahma is Rajas, the
forces of spin, motion,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and movement, the creative
father of the entire system.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu is [NON-ENGLISH],,
which means intelligence.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the cohesive force
that maintains the continuity

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.290 align:middle line:90%
of the whole system.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And Shiva is the force
of transformation

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:90%
and disintegration.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Hindus say of Shiva that he
is the most powerful lord

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.680 align:middle line:84%
because there is nothing in
the universe that does not

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:90%
arise from disintegration.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
As the lord of disintegration,
he maintains that

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
through his form as Mahakala.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Scientists who postulate
that everything resulted

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
from one big bang are
ignorant of the true nature

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:90%
of the system in which we live.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, particularly
in Egypt and India,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:84%
had a way of
thinking that allowed

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:84%
them to discover that this
entire system is musical.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It is the harmonies of
sound, echoing eternally

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:90%
through the infinite ether.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of that is simply
an imagination and idea

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that occurred in the
mind of the creator.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
is found throughout all

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.735 align:middle line:90%
the Puranic texts.

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the well-known methods
of geometric teachings

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
is the idea of
squaring the circle.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
This means a student of
the Pythagorean teachings

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
was asked to find a
circle and square which

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:84%
had the same measure
in their perimeters.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
This is something that is found
to preexist within the measures

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth and the moon.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
We must remember that
the diameter of the Earth

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
is approximately 7,920 miles.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:10%
If we look at a square which
has a side equal to the diameter

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.140 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, each side
has a measure of 7,920,

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:10%
for a total perimeter of 31,680.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
If we take a circle with that
same circumference of 31,680,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
it will have a radius
of 5,040, which

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:90%
is the number of the Kali Yuga.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
If you take the radius of
such a circle, which is 3,960,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and add it to the radius of
the moon, which is 1,080,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:84%
you also get the number of
the Kali Yuga, which is 5,040.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the circle
with the perimeter of 31,680.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:10%
If you inscribe within this
circle a 10-sided figure,

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:10%
you form a cord of
that circle to 1 to 10,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:10%
which gives us an arc
measurement of 3,168.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're talking about
10 yugas to a Maha-Kalpa.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
In the previous
episode, we revealed

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that the full length of the
Kali Yuga is 6,048 years.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Half of that yuga gives
us the number of 3,024.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:84%
If we put the arc measurement
of our circle, 3,168,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
over this half-yuga
number, we find

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
that they have the same
relationship as 3 over pi.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
This ratio, 3 over pi, is
found in the human body

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and also in classical
proportions.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
It is the ratio of the height
of man to his arm span,

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:84%
which is the same
ratio as the 10 yugas

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:90%
in the circle of the Earth.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a time period
which is resonant

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
with the movement and size
of our Earth and our bodies--

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
the body of the Earth
and the body of man.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:84%
How much of this was known
to the people who first

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:90%
came upon the yuga system?

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:90%
No one truly knows.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But where we are looking
from our perspective in time,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
this kind of information
is becoming available.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
The other interesting
thing is that when

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
you put the moon on
top of the Earth,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
you can build a right
triangle from their measures.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
One side is the radius of the
moon, which is 1,080 miles.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:10%
Another side is the
radius of the Earth,

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:10%
which is 3,960 miles.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:10%
This gives us the
hypotenuse of 4,104.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:10%
The measures of each
side of this triangle

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:10%
are all multiples of 72.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And 2 times 72 is equal to 144.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
embedded harmony of 144.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:90%
144 is, of course, 12 squared.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.260 align:middle line:84%
12 is the number that
not only dominates

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
the spacial relationship
of the Earth and moon.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But it also controls time,
with 12 hours on a clock

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:90%
and 12 months in a year.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The vision of the cycles of the
Earth are spatially imprinted.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we are
continually confronting

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.540 align:middle line:84%
harmonic relationships
that cross over

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
or transpose between
time and space.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.830 align:middle line:84%
If these are the underlying
organizing principles of space,

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
do they and are they
also found in time?

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:90%
We shall see that they do.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The procession of the equinox
is a retrograde motion

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
through each of
the zodiac signs.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
The procession moves one
degree every 72 years.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning
of spring, the sun

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
rises with a certain backdrop
of stars in the zodiac.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:84%
It will move backwards
one degree every 72 years

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and emerge after 360
degrees, or 25,920 years,

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:90%
back at the same place.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
This precession of the
equinox is recorded and noted

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:84%
in Stonehenge, in the
monuments in Peru.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And it is one of the sight lines
found at the Great Pyramid.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:84%
All of these
megaliths keep track

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:90%
of this rate of precession.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Plato called it
the "Great Year."

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
is analogous to what

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
we experience every year
with the Earth passing

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:90%
around the sun.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
The sequence of numbers that
we have looked at previously--

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:90%
216, 432, 864, and so on--

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
are all multiples of 72 and
are inherent in this number

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:90%
of years for time.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting that you
find in the yuga numbers that

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
are all composed of the
same forces or principles

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:90%
that these numbers represent.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The number 2,160 is the diameter
of the moon measured in miles.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And it is also the
duration of time

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
it takes to precess through
one sign of the zodiac, 2,160

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.610 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Simply inverse the
zero from the end

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and write it as 2,016 to find
a number in the yuga system.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
2,016 is one third of the full
duration of the Kali-Yuga.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
What we see is that
2,016 is a multiple of 7.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:90%
And 2,160 is a multiple of 3.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:84%
This gives us the
relationship of 7 to 3,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:84%
which we discussed as the
relationship of destruction.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
We are looking at
an inherent ratio

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that occurs in the simple
inversion of the sequence of 1

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:90%
to 10.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
10 is the number of
our fingers and toes.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And that principle is reiterated
in every one of the dimensions.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
When you find 4,320
in the precession,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:90%
you'll find 4,032 in the yuga.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
If you work it out into the
basic ratio that's being

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
expressed here, it's 14 to 15.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:90%
4,320 over 15 equals 288.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
4,032 over 14 equals 288,
the yuga to the precessional.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You can do that with
all of the numbers.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
We can see that these numbers
express the relationship not

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
only between space
and time, but also

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the idea that music
and vibration are

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
the language of the universe.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why this is
the yuga principle.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:54.198 align:middle line:90%
