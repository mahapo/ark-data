00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The tradition of knowledge of
the Yuga System is, of course,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
the duration of the yugas and
of the Yuga Cycle in general.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
That duration is sort of a
strange figure when you first

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
look at it, but it is
precisely 6,048 years.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:84%
As we continue,
we'll see exactly why

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that number emerges as the
key to the entire mystery

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:90%
of cyclic time.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We also learn that the
yugas appear in sets of 10

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and at 10 yugas was
called the Mahakalpa.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we have a
single cycle that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
is a little over 6,000 years
which occurs in sets of 10,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
giving us a roughly
60,000 year cycle overall.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
The first yuga is referred to
as both the Satya or the Krita

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Yuga.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Krita in Sanskrit means
the Age of Consciousness

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and Accomplishment.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks called
this the Golden Age.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.530 align:middle line:84%
With the metallic
association of the ages,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
we enter a kind of sense
of the alchemy of time.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
The second age is
the age of ritual.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the Treta Yuga.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
In terms of its metallic
value, it is silver.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it is in the age
that urbanization began.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
The Treta is called the
Age of the Three Fires.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The fire was the
fire and smoke that

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.810 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the beginning
of dense human settlement

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.280 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of technology.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:84%
The other fires are
the fires of ceremony

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and the fires of the
individual death and cremation.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:84%
As the population
moved and densified,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.270 align:middle line:84%
new methods of burial began
to emerge that did not

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:90%
occupy the former time phases.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the age when we see
the beginning of cremation.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
The third age is
called the Dvapara,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:90%
and it means the Age of Doubt.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:90%
It's metal is bronze or copper.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of a
sensing of the limited duration

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
of the whole cyclic
process of the emergence

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:84%
of the final and
perfected human form.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:90%
The last is the Age of Kali.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the age in
which there is a mixing

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of the blood of all races.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
The last age of Kali
is a concluding age

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:90%
in a cycle of 60,480 years.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
This is, of course,
the Iron Age,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and Kali is the agent of
conflict and destruction.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:10%
The Kali Yuga is 1
times 6,048 years.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.590 align:middle line:10%
The Dvapara Yuga is 2 times
6,048 years, which is 12,096.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:10%
The Treta Yuga is 3 times
6,048 years, or 18,192 years.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:10%
Then the golden age
is 24,192 years.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:10%
The setting of our number
system as cycles of 10

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:10%
is an application to an
understanding of the Yuga

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:10%
Cycle.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
There were other
cultures like Babylon

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that had a system
based on six and 60.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But the one that
has sustained itself

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
through to the end of the
Kali Yuga is the system of 10.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
We must look at numbers
in terms of each number

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
being a fraction of
an original unity.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Each number then becomes a unit.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.250 align:middle line:84%
It is an arithmetic progression
with the increase each time

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
of one unit like a partitioning
of an overall, all-containing

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:90%
unity.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Then we get to the end of the
cycle of the partitioning,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle line:90%
or division of unity.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the basic container
of its largest scale of time.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It is very interesting that
10 is a negation of number

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
because anything times 0
multiplied with 0 is 0.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
10 is a signal of a
completion and conclusion

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and the end of a
cycle of creation.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
This number series reiterates
the basic pattern of time

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and that is especially
applicable to the human being

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.840 align:middle line:84%
who signifies his belonging
to this system of time

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
through five fingers, five
toes, and five appendages, two

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:90%
arms, two legs, and the head.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
The number seven is the
principal and primary unit

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that expresses itself
through the Yuga System.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
The name of the number seven
contains the word even.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
This nomenclature is based on
the fact that 1 times 2 times

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:23.160 align:middle line:84%
3 times 4 times 5 times
6 times 7 equals 5,040.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
We have seven, bringing
forth a number that

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is exactly equal to
the radius of the Earth

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:90%
and the radius of the moon.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Then if you continue, we find
that 7 times 8 times 9 times

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
10 also equals 5,040.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So seven is the
break-off point that

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
establishes an even
summation, and that summation

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:90%
is inherent in the number 10.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.120 align:middle line:84%
These equations are expressed
by the balance point of seven.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
All of it is a reference
to the nature of time.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Our number system is
based on the entire yuga

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.980 align:middle line:90%
structure of time.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Also, seven in French is sept.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is the same root sound
that we have in such words

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
as serpent and Seth, the
Egyptian god of destruction.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
It is a homonym of Set, which
means knowledge and light.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Set is also the planet Saturn.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
Saturn was also

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the seventh
planet and the second sun.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It could be that there once
was a habitation on a planet

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
closer to Saturn whose
energy was creative in terms

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of the processes of
life in the same way

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
that the sun is to
our earthly location.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, NASA has
reported finding complex,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
organic, and
carbon-based molecules

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.300 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of Titan,
one of Saturn's moons,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
including mass quantities of
methane, ethane, and vinyl

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
cyanide, which planetary
scientists theorizes

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
similar to Earth's
primordial atmosphere.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Set in the Egyptian myth
is the villain character

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
who brings an end to
the life of Osiris.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The name Osiris is
very closely associated

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:90%
with the spelling of Sirius.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is the
mythic configuration

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.810 align:middle line:90%
representing the human species.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
He is the one that
at a certain point

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:84%
develops urbanization
and agriculture.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The entire development of Osiris
is an analog to the development

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:90%
that man has made on Earth.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
In the golden age, he left
the earth as a Garden of Eden,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:84%
just like what is reiterated in
variation in the Old Testament.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Later, he set himself into
a life of constant labor

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:90%
through agriculture.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.345 align:middle line:84%
This is all reiterated
in the myth of Osiris.

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:51.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Set, related to seven, is
both the mother and destroyer

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of the proportions of
the Earth and moon, which

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
are of critical importance to
generating the vibration which

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:84%
allows substance to
become conscious.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Another important
point mentioned

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
was the relationship between the
timing of the birth of Buddha

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and the birth of Christ and
that the Puranas specifically

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
say that Buddha is the
avatar of the Kali Yuga.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Information from several
of the Puranic texts

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
tell us that the
teachings of Buddha

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
contain the formula for the
transformation of consciousness

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:90%
into a sense of individuality.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a teaching of
rising above the ego

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:90%
to the true individual self.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
This teaching in
its deformed state

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
became a sense of
self-realization

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and self-righteousness
not on the spiritual,

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:84%
but on the material
sense and led

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
to the whole idea of
realization through accumulation

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
of wealth and power.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
That teaching in its lower
form became the theory

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
of capitalism, the
role of the individual

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
and is consuming, acquiring,
and acquisitive processes, which

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
were a huge
enhancement to commerce

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and allowed the whole
of the Kali Yuga

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:84%
to be dominated by
the commercial caste.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
This is not in any way a
derogatory view of Buddhism.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is an
ingenious creation

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
that hastened and assured
the direction or termination

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
of this phase of our
development in terms

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
of the prescribed
directives of time.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Buddha was actually fulfilling
the harmonics of the duration

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Kali Yuga.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The remarkable aspect
of his teachings

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is that it brings about the
destructive attitudes that

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
lead to the destruction
of the Earth

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
through our almost insane
obsession with consumption.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:84%
He also gave a
formula, which would

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:84%
allow people who are aware of
and sensitive to the nature

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
of time to be able to
confront this direction.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
That is the detachment, the
argument that this material

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:90%
world is only an illusion.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:84%
This fortified the ability
to confront and face

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
the disillusion with courage
and a kind of dignity.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Those are several
major points that

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
continue to draw
upon and reinforce

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the symbolism and the
possible accuracy of this very

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:90%
ancient prophetic system.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:10%
Let's examine the idea of how
the human organism is embedded

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:10%
in the cyclic processes
and pulsations of time

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.720 align:middle line:10%
within the entire
vast cycles of time

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:10%
called the yugas and the
procession of the equinox.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:10%
Our breathing and our
heartbeat are time intervals

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:10%
that are resonant
within the pulsation

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:10%
and patterns of the Earth.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, the human breath,
a normal full inhalation

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and exhalation, if it's not
cramped or reduced or repressed

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
by nervous tension, requires
four seconds of time.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
60 of these breaths, or pranas,
as they're called in India,

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the time
necessary for the Earth

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:90%
to rotate one degree.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
statistic is that

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
in a complete sidereal
day, a human being

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:90%
should breathe 21,600 breaths.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
A harmonic of this
number 2,160 is of course

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the duration of years in
one sign of the zodiac

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.315 align:middle line:84%
and is the measurement of the
diameter of the moon in miles.

00:11:14.315 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, the fathom is
a length of both arms extended.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Using Egyptian measures,
we find that a sphere

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
with the circumference
measuring 21,600,000 arms

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
spans, or fathoms, is
a close approximation

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of the equator of the Earth.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's polar ice
cap, which comes down

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:47.035 align:middle line:84%
to the 74th or 75th
latitude, is frozen ice.

00:11:47.035 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is in
proportion to the globe

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:84%
equals the proportion of
what the Egyptians called

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
the skullcap, which encloses
the cerebral cortex.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the part
of the brain that

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
has undergone tremendous
neurological changes

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
during the Kali Yuga,
especially in response

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.355 align:middle line:84%
to the great drought that began
at the beginning of the Kali

00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Yuga.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists have
verified the time period

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.610 align:middle line:84%
we've chosen as the
beginning of the Kali Yuga.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
3606 BC is a close
approximation to the beginning

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
of the drying that caused
the Middle East, the Iranian

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Plateau, Arabia,
and Northern Africa

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
to go into a sudden
reduction of rainfall.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
This drought affected
security and a sense of life

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:90%
and induced the fear of hunger.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Starvation caused the beginning
of refugee populations, people

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.290 align:middle line:84%
breaking connection with
the lands of their birth

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and moving around, not
necessarily nomadically,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
but searching for places
to settle and resettle.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:84%
In our examination of the human
body, moving from the skullcap

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to the hand and
finger, we find this

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is the key to understanding
the entire system

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:90%
of Egyptian measure.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of these measures
are relative to the forms

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:90%
and structures of the Earth.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
With Egyptian measure, the
width of a finger is a digit.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Four digits is a palm.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And seven palms of four
digits is a royal cubit.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
A cubit can also be measured
from the extended hand

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:90%
to the elbow.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:10%
Let's look to the crown
of the skull, which

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:10%
is a big focus point in
terms of the Egyptian view

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.000 align:middle line:10%
of human evolution.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And, remember, this
skullcap is symbolized

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:90%
by the scarab in Egypt.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:84%
If you place the palm of the
hand at the top of your head,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
you get the exact measure
of the crown of the skull.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Its size is one palm.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Then if you count three
palms down, or 12 fingers,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:90%
you get to the jaw.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
capacity for speech

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.430 align:middle line:90%
is contained in that palm.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:10%
Then you go underneath, and
the fourth palm of four digits

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:10%
reaches the voice box, which
allows for the articulation

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:10%
of language.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The conception to the
articulation processes

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of a human being are found
in the first four palms.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the genius
of Egypt, the way

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
they understood the relationship
between man and Earth.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:10%
Schwaller de Lubicz,
the great Egyptologist,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:10%
said that the Egyptians really
believed in the anthropocosm

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:10%
that the measures and
proportions of the human body

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:10%
contained the
significant dimensions

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:10%
of the entire universe.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's review some of the
astronomical associations

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:90%
with the proportion of 18.618.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a
golden mean number,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:90%
as it is 18 plus 1 over phi.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The square of this number,
18.618 times 18.618,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
is the number of
days in an eclipse

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:90%
year, which is 346.62 days.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:84%
An eclipse year is
calculated as the number

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
of days between two successive
conjunctions of the sun

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
with the same node
of the moon's orbit.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The moon is positioned and is
of the exact size necessary so

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that at an eclipse,
it completely

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
covers the sun, which is
93 million miles away.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:84%
The sun is approximately 400
times larger than the moon.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:10%
The moon is nearly
1/400 the distance

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:10%
between the Earth and the sun.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because of this
amazing coincidence,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.070 align:middle line:84%
the moon perfectly covers
the sun in a total eclipse.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the eclipse
year, 18.618 times 19.618

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:84%
equals 365.25, which is
exactly the solar year.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
18.618 times 20.168
is 383.89 days,

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
which is the exact
duration of 13 lunar

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:90%
cycles of 29.5 days each.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:10%
The more you allow yourself to
examine the geometry of time

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:10%
and space, the more the ideas
that this process which we're

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:10%
in is based on
chance or probability

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:10%
and those whole
concepts which dominate

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:10%
the Darwinian idea of evolution
become completely absurd.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's either childish
notions or it's fabricated.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
intentional disinformation.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
The total human body's height
contains approximately seven

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:90%
heads in total.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Women are almost exactly
seven heads in height,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
while men tend to be 7
and 1/2 heads in height.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But with careful
measurement, as far

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
as the height of
an average woman,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
you will find that it is not
just 7, but it is 7.142 heads.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not a whole number.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an irrational number,
a continuous decimal

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
into infinity.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Not only is the human
body using seven heads

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to describe its height, it
also has seven meridian points

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
running up and
down the human body

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
as the subtle centers
of energy that

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:90%
emanate from the seven chakras.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
To the left and to the
right are the energies

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that from the meridians
extend and emanate

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
into the field that
surrounds the body, which

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.504 align:middle line:90%
the Egyptians called the ka.

00:17:22.504 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:90%
We are this 14th part of 1,000.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
What 1,000 represents
in Indian thought

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
is three levels of existence.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
We saw 10 as the
number of the divisions

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that unity makes to
create the harmonics

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
in the vibratory world, which
leads to all these harmonics

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:90%
within the formal world.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Seven and 14 are the number of
fields that are generated back

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:90%
into the vibratory environment.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to see the
entire process of embodiment

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.730 align:middle line:84%
by understanding its resonance
with certain configurations

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the process in
which the energy goes

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
from an energetic state into an
embodied or substantiated state

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:90%
and then back again.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It is sustained physiologically
with the constant composing

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and decomposing of tissue.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It is a process that
causes an emanation,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and that decomposed substance
emanates itself resonantly back

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:90%
into a field.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Life and embodiment is
moving from a wave situation

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to a particle structure as they
have found in quantum theory.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:84%
From particle to wave and
from wave into particle,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
this is the succession
of matter from waveform

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:90%
to form and back again.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
The texts that are supposedly
the most authentic concerning

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
the life of Buddha are
found in Tibet and India,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
particularly the texts
found in Sri Lanka.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
They say that Buddha lived
for 78 years, born in 621 BC,

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:90%
and died in 543 BC.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a duration of 78 years.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:10%
His realization is
said to have occurred,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:10%
as the same with Christ,
when he was 33 years old.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:10%
That occurs in the
midpoint of his life.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:10%
That means that the
midpoint of his life

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:10%
and his spiritual
realization is exactly

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:10%
at 582 BC, the very
center of the Kali Yuga.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Buddha was born in the
age of Aries, which is

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:90%
the first sign of the zodiac.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:84%
In approximately 150 BC, we
change from the sign of Aries

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
to the sign of Pisces.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we have 432 years
separating the birth of Buddha

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning
of the age of Pisces.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And, as we have seen, 432 is
one of the major multiples

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:90%
of the procession.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The Puranas prophesied
that amongst the barbarians

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
of the West, an avatar who is
simply an extension of Buddha

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:90%
would arise.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Many people have interpreted
that the second phase

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
of the avatar of
Buddha is Christ.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
key dates concerning Christ.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It appears that the birth of
Christ was either 3 or 4 AD.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
This means that he was
born in the age of Pisces.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
There is much medieval
symbolism which

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
associates Christ as the
dominant figure of the Piscean

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Age.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
that Buddha

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
is the dominant figure
coming from the age of Aries

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and Christ is the dominant
figure of the Piscean Age.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Christ was said to
have his realization

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:84%
through a sacrificial ritual
33 years after year 4,

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:90%
which would make it 37 AD.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
The sacrificial ritual was
the Resurrection of Christ.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:84%
This begins a series of numbers
based on the intervals of 37.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
This is again three and
seven, the key numbers

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
in the merger of the precession
with the Yuga System.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
All of the dates then in
this yuga can start with 37.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:84%
37 is a very interesting
number because it

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
number of the triplicity.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Every time you multiply a 2
or a multiple of 3 times 37,

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.260 align:middle line:90%
you get a triple number.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:90%
3 times 37 is 111.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:90%
6 times 37 is 222.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:84%
This triplicity
continues all the way

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
through the number 999,
which is 37 times 27.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, we can
follow the succession of 37

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:84%
up to the date of the end
of the Kali Yuga, which

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:90%
is 37 times 66, or 2,444.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the more
interesting explorations

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:10%
of the symbolic
nature of our history

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:10%
to go through the
multiples of 37.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the most prominent
and most interesting

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
will be the appearance
of the United States

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:90%
and the origins of that country.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:10%
1776 is a multiple
of 37 times 48, which

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:10%
is the number of states
in the first completed

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:10%
union of the United States.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:10%
It is also the birthday
of the politically active

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.490 align:middle line:10%
and historically
formative secret

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:10%
society known as the Illuminati.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:10%
The Illuminati was
started by a Jesuit

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:10%
priest named Adam Weishaupt.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:10%
There is ample
evidence that he was

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:10%
a main influence on
Benjamin Franklin

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:10%
and the founders of the United
States, even to the degree

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:10%
that the Washington Monument
is exactly 555 feet high,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:10%
which is 15 times 37.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The entire street
design of Washington

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is based on an angle
of 72 degrees, which

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
is descriptive of a Pentagon.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We will get to the Pentagon
and its importance in the yuga

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and in the story of
mankind in later episodes.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.610 align:middle line:84%
All these numbers
are multiples of 37.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The year 1665, which is
the great plague of London,

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.970 align:middle line:90%
is 37 times 45.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
The year 1998, which
is 37 times 54,

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:84%
is when the sun returned
to direct alignment

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:90%
with the center of the galaxy.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
All of these are yuga dates
set by the resurrection

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of the body of Christ.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Christ, his death
and resurrection,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol for the
Kali Yuga's potential

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
for the death and resurrection
of the entire body

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.710 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we can see
that the Buddha taught

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
us to meditate and
accept the coming

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
destruction of ourselves, both
as a body and as a species,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
while the teachings
of Christ were

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to show us that a resurrection
of the body and of the species

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely possible.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Both Buddha and Jesus Christ,
avatars of the Kali Yuga,

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
gave our species
knowledge and tools

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that will help us endure
the destructive tendencies

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of our age.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:90%
