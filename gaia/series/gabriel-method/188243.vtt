00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So in this section, we're
going to talk about some

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.618 align:middle line:84%
of the physical stresses that
activate the fat programs.

00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go-- in
this section we'll deal

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:90%
with the physical stresses.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.047 align:middle line:84%
The next section, we'll deal
with the mental and emotional

00:00:32.047 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
sections, stresses, and
then after lunch, we'll

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:90%
kind of tie it all together.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And also at the end
of this, I'm going

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:90%
to make you a little snack.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Normally the way we do
it is we make the snack

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
while I'm talking
and then we feed you

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
while you're sitting
there, but we're not

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to do it,
because the crowd is just

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:90%
too big.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to make a snack
for myself, and you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
can sit there and watch me eat
it and see how much I enjoy it.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of
the section, be it'll

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
be all made for you, waiting
for you when you go out

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
for the next break, OK?

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of looking forward
to that, making it for myself.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to talk about
some of the physical stress.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
want to talk about

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is how to regulate
your blood sugar.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
fat programs are on,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.710 align:middle line:84%
you lose the ability to regulate
your blood sugar properly.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason for
that, and I'll explain that,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
but you need to understand
that, because your body's not

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
functioning the way
it normally should.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And it causes you
to become tired,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and exhausted, and
crave junk food.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And unless you learn how
to manage your blood sugar,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.632 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be fighting blind,

00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be like you're
driving with the emergency

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:90%
brake on.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.575 align:middle line:84%
You don't know why you're
hungry, why you're tired.

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever notice, maybe like
an hour or two after a meal,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you're hungry for something
sweet and you're tired?

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And around 4 o'clock, 3 or
4 o'clock, you're exhausted.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes around 11
o'clock, 11 or 12 o'clock,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
you've really got to have
something sweet before lunch.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day
before you go to sleep.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:90%
How many people have that?

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:90%
I used to have that.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I used to like-- at
night, I was just so

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
famished, finally need some sort
of brownies, pizza, junk food.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.883 align:middle line:90%
Something at night.

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%
I just couldn't go to sleep.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So I used to have that too
and, that's all intentional.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It's an intentional
act on your body

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
to actually cause you to gain
weight and hold onto weight

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:90%
when your fat programs are on.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So you need to understand how to
keep your blood sugar stable so

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that you have more energy and
you don't crave junk food.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.412 align:middle line:90%
You can make good food choices.

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this first
section is really

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:90%
about getting more energy.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Energy to deal with some of
the other issues in your life

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.175 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to talk about
in the next section, which

00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
are some of the mental
and emotional issues,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
issues regarding either--
whether it's relationships,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
or career, or
finding your passion,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
or people that are being
mentally or physically abusive

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You need energy
to deal with that.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Energy to be more
physically active.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.692 align:middle line:84%
So that's we we're going
to talk about right now,

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
is how to regulate
your blood sugar.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.728 align:middle line:90%
And it's really, really crucial.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And I've explained this--

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.182 align:middle line:84%
this is stuff that's out there,
what I'm telling you now,

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
but the way I've
explained it, I've

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
had doctors and nurses at
seminars come up to me and say,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:84%
no one's ever really
explained it that way.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And so now I get it.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is my own
take on blood sugar

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and how to keep your
blood sugar stable.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So the way it works is your
body needs to keep your blood--

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:84%
your body needs to keep a little
bit of sugar in your blood

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Not too much and not too little.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.370 align:middle line:84%
If you have too much
sugar in your blood,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that can cause nerve
damage to your body.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have too little
sugar in your blood,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:90%
your brain can't function.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You become tired,
irritable, and it causes you

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to crave junk food, because
junk food is the quickest

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:90%
way to get sugar back in.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So when your blood
sugar falls too low,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.600 align:middle line:90%
you're going to want to--

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.550 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
make a food choice.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.508 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
craving for the quickest

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
source of sugar, and that's
always the worst choice.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:84%
So throughout the
day, your body wants

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to keep your sugar in your
blood in a narrow range.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Not too high, not too low.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And it has ways of
keeping your blood sugar

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:90%
not too high and not too low.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:90%
And this is how it does it.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a meal,
your blood sugar

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
goes up, higher
than it should be.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat a meal, your
blood sugar goes up to here.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Now your body has to
lower your blood sugar.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The way your body
lowers blood sugar is it

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
actually stores the sugar
in the cells of your body.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
In your muscle cells,
and your liver cells,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and your fat cells,
it stores the sugar.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, you can
look at the cells of your body

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
as like a bank
account for sugar.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is your blood
sugar goes up after a meal,

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and your body secretes a
hormone called insulin.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.578 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one.

00:05:22.578 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:90%
You need to know about insulin.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Most of you probably do.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So insulin is a fat
storage hormone.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of insulin
is to store sugar and fat

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
in your body, and the
way it works is this.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
If this was a cell in your body,
insulin goes up to the cell

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.865 align:middle line:84%
and acts like a key that
opens up a little doorway.

00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the cell is open now
so that sugar can go in,

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and other nutrients.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:90%
That's insulin's job.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like this little
key that travels

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
through your bloodstream
unlocking cells.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happens, all the sugar

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
that's in your
bloodstream then gets

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:84%
stored in the cells of
your body so your blood

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.162 align:middle line:90%
sugar goes back down.

00:06:13.162 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And when your blood
sugar goes back down,

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
your insulin levels
go back down.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.425 align:middle line:84%
Then, throughout
the day, as you're

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
using that sugar--
your brain needs it,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
your muscles need it-- as
you're using that sugar,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
your blood sugar
goes down again.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Now when your blood
sugar goes too low,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:90%
the exact opposite happens.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Your body secretes
a different hormone

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that goes up to your
cells and unlocks it

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.650 align:middle line:90%
and gets the sugar back out.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And as it gets the
sugar back out,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:90%
your blood sugar goes up again.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, your body's
able to regulate its blood

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.790 align:middle line:90%
sugar like this.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
When it gets too high, the
insulin comes in and lowers it.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
When it gets too low,
other hormones raise it.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, you
can have lots of energy

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you notice, people when
their bodies are functioning

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
properly, more
naturally thin people,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.078 align:middle line:84%
they have energy
throughout the day.

00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they need-- maybe they
eat a lot, maybe they don't.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they miss meals.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, all those
naturally thin people,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
they eat whatever they want,
but one thing we never focus on

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:90%
is how many meals they miss.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
When your body wants
to be fat, it's

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:90%
very rare that you miss a meal.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.502 align:middle line:84%
You're counting your
meals and you're

00:07:25.502 --> 00:07:26.670 align:middle line:90%
waiting for the next meal.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
You know how many meals
you're going to have.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:84%
You know exactly when
you're going to have them

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.365 align:middle line:84%
and what you're going
to have, and it's

00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:90%
because you really want them.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But when your body's
functioning properly,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of energy,
and maybe you miss a meal.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you go-- and then all of
a sudden, you miss two meals

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.522 align:middle line:84%
and then you're famished
and you eat a lot.

00:07:41.522 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,
because your body can keep

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:90%
the energy flowing properly.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But when the fat programs
get activated, what happens

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
is your body stops listening
to the hormone insulin.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:84%
You get what's called
insulin resistance.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:02.237 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.237 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:90%
Your body stops listening.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is if
this was a cell again,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.546 align:middle line:84%
and insulin goes up
and says open up,

00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:90%
the cell doesn't listen.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So the cell doesn't open
up, and so your blood sugar

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:90%
doesn't go down.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So you eat a meal, your
blood sugar goes up,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
your insulin levels go up,
but your blood sugar still

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.397 align:middle line:84%
doesn't go up, because
your cells aren't

00:08:30.397 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:90%
listening to the insulin.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And so your body has to produce
more and more and more and more

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
insulin to get your
blood sugar to go down.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.247 align:middle line:84%
So then your blood sugar
eventually goes down,

00:08:42.247 --> 00:08:44.455 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is you've
produced so much more insulin

00:08:44.455 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:90%
than you need.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.943 align:middle line:84%
Then your insulin
levels stay up here.

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:90%
They stay elevated.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't go down all the way.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what--
the key about insulin

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is that when your insulin
levels are elevated,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.942 align:middle line:84%
it stops the other
hormones that burn fat,

00:08:57.942 --> 00:08:59.150 align:middle line:90%
that retrieve the sugar back.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It stops them from coming
out, because your body

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:84%
won't let you be in fat
storage mode and fat burning

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%
mode at the same time.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So if insulin is
in your system, it

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:84%
will stop the other hormones
from coming into your body.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
You will lose the ability
to regain the sugar out

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:90%
of your cells.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.408 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
like a bank account

00:09:17.408 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that you're putting
money in, putting

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:90%
money in, that's frozen.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't get the
money back out.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all
this excess energy is.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.378 align:middle line:90%
It's a frozen bank account.

00:09:28.378 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
We have all the energy we need
to survive as long as we want.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
We just can't access it,
because you've lost the ability.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Because insulin as a hormone
is stopping the other hormones

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%
from being activated.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So this is what happens.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So you eat a meal, your blood
sugar goes up the way it does,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and then insulin goes way up,
way higher than it should be.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.287 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, your blood
sugar goes back down,

00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
but your insulin levels
are still activated.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So right around
here, your body would

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.147 align:middle line:84%
secrete those other hormones
to get your insulin levels--

00:10:02.147 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to get your blood
sugar to go back up,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't, because
insulin is stopping it.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
So your blood sugar goes
down, down, down, down, down,

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and you get this
blood sugar plummet.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, that's
11 o'clock, that's 4 o'clock.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:90%
That's two hours after a meal.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.210 align:middle line:84%
That's right before
you go to sleep.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
you are exhausted

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
and your body is craving
sugar, pizza, chips, junk food,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.700 align:middle line:84%
something like
you can't imagine.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And it's just mechanical.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.078 align:middle line:90%
It's not because you're weak.

00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Not because you're lazy.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:90%
It's mechanics.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:90%
You need sugar.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:90%
You can't access your sugar.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you eat some
sort of quick fix,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and you get this
blood sugar spike.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.643 align:middle line:84%
And the blood sugar spike causes
your insulin levels to spike.

00:10:48.643 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And that insulin spike
causes your blood sugar

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to plummet again, and
you're right back down here

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:90%
two hours later.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:90%
You're exhausted.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:57.972 align:middle line:90%
You're craving junk food.

00:10:57.972 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:90%
You spike again.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is you get
that first plummet around here.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
You get a spike, plummet,
spike, plummet, spike, plummet.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And all day long, you're
eating junk food every time

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:90%
you get to this point.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Not because you need energy,
not because you need nutrition.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Simply because you can't
access the energy that you're

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.210 align:middle line:90%
walking around with.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And you're just eating all
day because your body's not

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:90%
functioning properly.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is
you need to get your body

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.188 align:middle line:84%
to listen to insulin
again, and you

00:11:36.188 --> 00:11:38.355 align:middle line:84%
need to eat foods that keep
your blood sugar stable.

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat foods that
keep your blood sugar stable,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:55.055 align:middle line:84%
what happens is your blood
sugar stays like this.

00:11:55.055 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
If you eat foods that cause
your blood sugar spike,

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.712 align:middle line:90%
it goes like this.

00:11:58.712 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So you want to eat foods that
keep your blood sugar stable,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and you want to get
the cells of your body

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:90%
to listen to insulin again.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
You want your body to become
more sensitive to insulin.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:21.742 align:middle line:84%
Now, the foods that I recommend
eating will do two things.

00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:23.200 align:middle line:84%
One, they'll cause
your body become

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive to
insulin, and they'll

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
cause your body to release
sugar in a very, very slow way.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.805 align:middle line:84%
And those two things,
combined over time,

00:12:33.805 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:84%
will help undo
the whole process.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And those foods that I
recommend eating are--

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and again, I recommend
adding to your diet, OK,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:84%
not turning into a diet,
but adding these things--

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.145 align:middle line:84%
are a really good
source of protein.

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You need some-- you need to
have a really good source

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:84%
of omega-3 fatty acids, and
you need a really good source

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:90%
of live food.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
These three things combined will
do the job, because protein--

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:90%
hold on.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Let me do the next screen.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:90%
I'll write those again.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:90%
So protein.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Protein, there we
go, protein keeps--

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:90%
protein is not a sugar.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not a source
of energy, but it

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:90%
can become a source of energy.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
We need protein for our
muscles, for our enzymes,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of different
processes in your body.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat more protein
than your body needs,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.620 align:middle line:84%
it will convert it into sugar,
or at least into energy,

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and it will do it in
a very slow process.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
It takes a couple of hours.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.853 align:middle line:84%
So when you eat protein, your
blood sugar goes like this.

00:13:50.853 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have protein
every meal to keep

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:90%
your blood sugar stable.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Omega-3 fatty acids.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Omega-3 fatty acids are
an essential fatty acid.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Essential means you
have to have it.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Your body can't produce
it, and you need it.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And we go sometimes 20, 30 years
without having a proper source

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.413 align:middle line:90%
of omega-3 fatty acids.

00:14:15.413 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And this causes a
lot of problems,

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
because all of the
cells of our body

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:90%
are covered in a layer of fat.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not the
right fat, then our cells

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
are not able to communicate with
the chemical messengers known

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
as hormones that travel
through our body.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the types
of fats like fried foods,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:90%
saturated fats, it's a hard fat.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So our cell has like a
hard fat coating to it.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
So when the hormones come,
they don't listen properly.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't interact properly
with the hormones.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And this causes a
lot of problems.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Not just obesity.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It causes bipolar disease,
heart disease, inflammation,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
arthritis.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So many different
chronic problems

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.442 align:middle line:84%
that we have right now are
caused simply because our cells

00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
are not covered
with the right fat.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you take for
example bipolar disease,

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:84%
all of our brain
cells are 65% fat.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And when it's the wrong fat,
the neurotransmitters that

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.147 align:middle line:84%
communicate with
the brain cells,

00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the brain cells don't
listen properly.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So you get this
sort of imbalance

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:90%
that can cause bipolar disease.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Then you take medication
for bipolar disease,

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and that causes obesity.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply because
you have the wrong fat.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting the wrong
oil in a car, or the wrong fuel

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.720 align:middle line:84%
in a car, day after
day for 20 years.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to start
breaking down more and more

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:90%
and more and more over time.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Now omega-3s are a
very permeable fat

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that allow for
proper communication

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
with the hormones, insulin,
and all the neurotransmitters

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.525 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, and lots
of different hormones.

00:15:54.525 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so your body starts
functioning properly.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But you need to
have omega-3 fatty

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
acids in your diet every
single day for six months.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:09.435 align:middle line:84%
It takes about six months for
your cells to be regenerated.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Every day, hundreds
of millions of them

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
die and hundreds of
millions of them are reborn,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
but it takes about six
months to really coat

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:90%
all of your body with omega-3s.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's not like a--

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
when I say to take
omega-3s, it's

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.593 align:middle line:84%
not like a lose weight
drug that you're

00:16:22.593 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:84%
expecting that all a
sudden you're going

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to lose 10 kilos in two weeks.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It's forever to get the right
type of flow in your body

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
so that everything's
functioning properly.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So omega-3s will
cause your body--

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.240 align:middle line:84%
will cause your cells to regain
the sensitivity to insulin.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And that means that when
your insulin levels go up,

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:84%
the blood sugar goes down
the way it's supposed to be.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.423 align:middle line:84%
But your insulin
levels go all the way

00:16:50.423 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:84%
down so that when your
blood sugar lowers again,

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.638 align:middle line:84%
the other hormones can come
and bring it back up naturally,

00:16:57.638 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
because insulin is
not blocking that.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.993 align:middle line:84%
Insulin, by the way, is also
the fat storage hormone.

00:17:01.993 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And as long as
your insulin levels

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
are elevated, which
is the case now,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
you're in a perpetual
state of fat storage.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people look
at calories in, calories out,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and nobody even
asks the question,

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
do I even have the ability
to lose weight, to burn fat?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And when your insulin
levels are elevated,

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
no, you do not have the
ability to burn fat.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
You do not have the
ability to burn fat.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:90%
Mechanically.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Not because you're weak and
lazy, but because insulin

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
will not allow your
body to secrete

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:90%
the hormones that burn fat.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:90%
It stops it.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be in fat-burning
and fat-losing mode at the same

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.428 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
fat-making mode, you

00:17:44.428 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
can't be in fat-making mode and
fat-losing mode-- fat-burning

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:90%
mode at the same time.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.063 align:middle line:84%
You're in fat-making
mode, which means

00:17:49.063 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
your insulin levels are up
and it won't let you burn fat.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a chronic
state of elevated insulin.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.173 align:middle line:84%
It's called hyperinsulinemia,
hyper meaning high, insulin.

00:17:59.173 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
We're in a chronic state
of elevated insulin levels.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So omega-3s will get
your body to become

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.638 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive to insulin
so the insulin levels can

00:18:08.638 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:84%
lower properly and you can
regain the ability burn fat.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So not only do you
have more energy

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and are you not craving
junk food anymore,

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
but you have regained
the ability to burn fat.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
ATM card now works

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and you can take the money out.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And then your cells become
more of a breathing thing.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You eat too much,
you store it as fat.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You go a couple days later,
over the next couple of days,

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:90%
you use it.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:90%
You burn the fat again.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It becomes more of
a breathing thing,

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.360 align:middle line:84%
not a frozen bank
account that you're

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
putting energy in all the time
and just having it stay frozen.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.175 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.175 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So omega-3s, you have
to have them every day.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Live food.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by
live food mainly is

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
food that existed before
we started inventing food

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:90%
in an uncooked way.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Fruits, salads,
vegetables, nuts, seeds.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Especially green leafy
things have chlorophyll.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Chlorophyll captures sunlight
and converts that sunlight

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
into fats, carbohydrates,
and proteins.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole reason
there's life on Earth.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:90%
It's captured sunlight.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:90%
It's captured energy.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is the
cow eats the chlorophyll,

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:84%
gets the proteins and
the fats and everything,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:90%
then we kill the cow.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:90%
We freeze it.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:90%
We dehydrate it.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:90%
We microwave it.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:90%
We process it.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.688 align:middle line:84%
We put it with a million
different invented foods.

00:19:33.688 --> 00:19:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's no more
life force in it.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no more
captured sunlight.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing live in there.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:90%
We need that live food.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.222 align:middle line:84%
And people are just starting
to measure it right now.

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know that life
force exists in a tangible way

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.305 align:middle line:84%
that we can measure the same way
that we didn't know that radio

00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:90%
waves existed 100 years ago.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:90%
But life force exists.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.847 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:19:52.847 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:84%
We know there's a difference
between a live person

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:90%
and a dead person, right?

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.300 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't we?

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't?

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.668 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows
there's a difference

00:20:01.668 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
between a live person
and a dead person.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:90%
That's life force energy.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.135 align:middle line:84%
It's the same difference between
a live food and a dead food.

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
When you eat a live
food, you're eating

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:90%
life force that makes you live.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
When you eat dead, food
you're eating dead food.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:90%
It makes you dead.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:90%
We didn't used to eat dead food.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Nothing we ever ate thousands
of years ago is dead.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Not one thing, not even meat.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It was alive, and it
had life force in it.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're just
beginning to discover

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.300 align:middle line:84%
how to measure that life
force through things like--

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:90%
they call it biophotons.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain degree
of biophotons in live food

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that goes into your
cells, and interacts

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
with your DNA and
repairs the DNA,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and strengthens
your immune system,

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.452 align:middle line:84%
So you need these three
things, protein, omega-3s,

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and life food, and you
need them in every meal.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.975 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.975 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So every meal, you
want to ask yourself

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:84%
where's the protein,
where's the omega-3s,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.867 align:middle line:90%
and where's the live food?

00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
This is something that-- this
is like a little breakfast

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.450 align:middle line:90%
that I recommend.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Which I'm going to
make it for you.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done this before.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.678 align:middle line:84%
Usually I have people
helping me make it.

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But this is this an
example of a meal

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that's got protein,
omega-3s and live food, OK?

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
But don't eat this for
the rest of your life

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:90%
every morning for breakfast.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Don't turn this into
the Gabriel Method Diet

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
where this is the food
that you have to eat.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's just an example, OK?

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm taking some yogurt,
which you don't necessarily

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.095 align:middle line:84%
need the yogurt,
but the yogurt's

00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
got some good probiotics
that help with digestion.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a good
source of protein powder.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:90%
This is a whey protein powder.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It's unsweetened, unflavored
whey protein powder.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:90%
That's a good source of protein.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Where's Helen?

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.937 align:middle line:90%
Are you here, Helen?

00:21:39.937 --> 00:21:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Normally Helen does this for me.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I can't survive
anymore without Helen.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's a
good sort of portion.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.038 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm going to
put some omega-3s

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
in the form of chia seeds, which
are the hottest rage right now.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:84%
These look a little bit like
sesame-- or poppy seeds.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking poppy seeds.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll just put those in.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Ground flax seeds are a really
good source of omega-3s.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Flax seeds or linseeds.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:84%
You can buy these at the
health food store for like $10

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.467 align:middle line:90%
a kilo organic.

00:22:07.467 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
recommend you buy organic.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll talk about that later.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But you grind them-- you buy
them whole, you grind them up.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:90%
It will last you a month.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the best source of
omega-3s you can get.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:90%
A really good one anyway.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And put that in.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm just going to put
some fresh fruit in there.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And so that's got
those basic components.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And just mix that up.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.752 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.752 --> 00:22:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to eat this
while you guys sit and watch

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
me, while your blood sugar is
going down and down and down.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need a
sweetener, but we usually

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:90%
put a little bit of sweetener.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
As a sweetener, I
recommend xylitol.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Xylitol is a natural sweetener,
not an artificial sweetener.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
artificial sweeteners,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
because they actually
activate the fat programs.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is another example
of calories in calories out

00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:90%
and how flawed that is.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They've done studies with
people that drink diet soda,

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that if you drink diet soda,
you're like five times more

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
likely to gain weight
over the next five years.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that
some of the components

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
of artificial sweeteners
like aspartame

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:84%
have in them a
neurotransmitter that

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
turns on your fat programs.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
chemistry, not calories.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get any
calories from a sweetener,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
activate your fat programs,

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
so you going to get
it somewhere else.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So artificial sweeteners will
activate your fat programs.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So will some
artificial ingredients.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
For example MSG, also known
as flavor enhancer 621

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of-- hydrolyzed
vegetable protein.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:90%
A lot of other terms.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
MSG activates your fat programs,
and everybody knows this.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a thing
that drives me nuts.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that if you're
a biochemical researcher,

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
and you want to study
obesity, and you

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
want to first do some tests
on mice, mice aren't fat.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:90%
You've got to make a mouse fat.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.510 align:middle line:84%
You know how you
make a mouse fat?

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Feed him MSG.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.700 align:middle line:90%
There's even a term for it.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:90%
MSG obesity-induced mice.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows this.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.222 align:middle line:84%
They're not saying
does MSG make you fat?

00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, oh,
you want a fat mouse?

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We'll give him some MSG.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And MSG is in all of our food.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.700 align:middle line:84%
It's in 80%--
anything that you buy

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that's got flavor
enhancer of any kind

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to have
some sort of MSG.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.100 align:middle line:84%
It causes you to
become addicted.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
It has the glutamic acid in
MSG, monosodium glutamate.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.750 align:middle line:84%
The glutamic acid excites
a part of your brain

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.980 align:middle line:84%
that activates
your fat programs,

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and it's in all our food.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.465 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about calories
in and calories out.

00:24:42.465 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:84%
It's about understanding
how your body works.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Xylitol on the other hand
is a natural sweetener

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't elevate your blood
sugar like table sugar does.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
It keeps your blood
sugar very stable.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It actually helps your
body absorb calcium,

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
so it's a legitimate
treatment for osteoporosis.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps
fight dental decay.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And because it helps
your body absorb calcium,

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:84%
it reduces inflammation,
which means

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.420 align:middle line:84%
it reduces the hormones that
cause inflammation which

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:84%
are called
proinflammatory cytokines,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and those hormones
activate your fat programs.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.363 align:middle line:84%
So believe it or
not, xylitol can

00:25:18.363 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:90%
help in many different ways.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.613 align:middle line:90%
And it tastes really good.

00:25:20.613 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
You can cook with it,
you can clean with it.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.902 align:middle line:90%
Gets stains off of everything.

00:25:27.902 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.125 align:middle line:90%
And just mix it up.

00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's an example, but
there's lots of different ways

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that you can get
omega-3s and live food.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
For example for breakfast,
you can have eggs and salmon

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and wrapped up in
nori with some salad.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Sprinkle some ground
flax seeds on it.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Kind of sprinkle ground
flax on pretty much anything

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:90%
you have, I recommend.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Another good way to get
omega-3s is through fish oils.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.710 align:middle line:90%
The best fish oil is krill oil.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend
that you do both.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.307 align:middle line:84%
I recommend you have fish
oils, five to 10 grams a day,

00:26:05.307 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and I recommend that
you put ground linseeds

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.015 align:middle line:90%
on most of your food.

00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And eat cold water fish.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.855 align:middle line:84%
And eat a lot of
green leafy vegetables

00:26:10.855 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that also have omega-3s
and live food in them.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
focus is on adding,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to get
your omega-3s every day.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
start taking questions.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Are we starting-- can
we take questions now?

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we can start taking
questions now as I do this.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to--
but for questions, we

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:84%
need you to stand up and
we'll have microphones, so

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:90%
hold on one second.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Please stand up
so we can see you.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.795 align:middle line:84%
We'll start with the
lady at the front.

00:26:34.795 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we do that, I just
need to make sure that this is

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.580 align:middle line:90%
going to work for you guys.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:90%
Haven't eaten breakfast yet.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.840 align:middle line:84%
This is just to
further emphasize

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like to
have low blood sugar,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.745 align:middle line:84%
because you can sit
there and watch me.

00:26:47.745 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Needs to be a
little bit sweeter.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have--

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Can I get a volunteer
to taste this?

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't want me to
jump up on the stage.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.988 align:middle line:90%
>> You can if you want.

00:27:09.988 --> 00:27:11.070 align:middle line:90%
You can jump up.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.990 align:middle line:90%
You can crawl up.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.657 align:middle line:90%
However you want.

00:27:15.657 --> 00:27:16.599 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:20.390 align:middle line:90%
The pressure's on.

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.102 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.102 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I could eat a lot of that.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.752 align:middle line:90%
>> She could eat a lot of that.

00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:27.596 align:middle line:84%
Give her a hand,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:27:27.596 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:90%
You can take that back.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:90%
No, you have to keep that here.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:31.923 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:27:31.923 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Can I take some
questions, please?

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> My question is do the
flax seeds have to be ground,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.158 align:middle line:84%
or can you just sprinkle
them on and eat as-is?

00:27:44.158 --> 00:27:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is do the
flax seeds need to be ground?

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:47.595 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:27:47.595 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:84%
The flax seeds need to be
ground, because your body won't

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:90%
absorb them otherwise.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't absorb.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.255 align:middle line:84%
It just passes
right through you.

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:56.690 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
My question's about
flax seeds as well.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.918 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a nut allergy, and
I've been in the health food

00:28:02.918 --> 00:28:05.600 align:middle line:84%
shop previously, and
they say it's very nutty.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.558 align:middle line:90%
It's a very nutty seed.

00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:07.358 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:07.358 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So I wondered if there's
any substitutes for, like you

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
always talk about
seeds and nuts.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So is it all seeds
that you're allergic to?

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.825 align:middle line:84%
Because nuts are a little
bit different than seeds.

00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I do find
seeds make me allergic.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.622 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, then I
would stick with fish oils.

00:28:20.622 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And again, the best type
of fish oil is krill oil.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned, I
think you should take,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:84%
especially you, I think you
should take 10 grams a day.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Now people, when you
buy fish oil capsules,

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.608 align:middle line:84%
they say to take one to three
a day, something like that.

00:28:33.608 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people
to take five or 10.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And your doctor may tell
you to take something

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.940 align:middle line:90%
less than what I say.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't go against your doctor.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Always go with what
your doctor tells you.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I say to take
10 grams of fish oil a day

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:90%
is all it is is it's oil.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a drug.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not a medication.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's in
pill form, it's an oil.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.453 align:middle line:90%
And it's 10 grams of an oil.

00:28:57.453 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the store
and you get fish and chips,

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.380 align:middle line:84%
you're getting about
30 grams of fat.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But that fat causes all kinds
of problems in your system.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.532 align:middle line:84%
Causes the cells of your
body to become hard,

00:29:10.532 --> 00:29:12.490 align:middle line:84%
stop listening to insulin,
causes inflammation.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.323 align:middle line:84%
All these things activate
your fat programs.

00:29:14.323 --> 00:29:17.175 align:middle line:84%
And it's 30, 40 grams and you
don't think twice about it.

00:29:17.175 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, your
doctor doesn't say

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:23.320 align:middle line:84%
just have two grams of
fish and chips, right?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden
there's fish oil

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:84%
in its most pure
form, which all it is

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
is fish in its most pure
form that can help you.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden we've
got to put a limit on that.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand that.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So when you take 10 grams of
fish oil, which I really think

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.660 align:middle line:90%
you should take, it's just oil.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So especially for you,
I would take 10 grams.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.212 align:middle line:84%
Krill oil is the best,
but it's very expensive.

00:29:47.212 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't
have krill oil,

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
there's oil derived from
exclusively small fish.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They have less heavy
metals, because larger fish

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:59.445 align:middle line:84%
have more metals in them,
so it has less toxins.

00:29:59.445 --> 00:30:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
ask, do you need

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to put the sweetener
in the yogurt?

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:90%
You don't need sweetener at all.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.577 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
yogurt at all either.

00:30:11.577 --> 00:30:13.467 align:middle line:90%
What you need are the omega-3s.

00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:84%
You need the omega-3s, the
protein, and live food.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.280 align:middle line:84%
You can make it
any way you want.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84%
You could just take the
protein, and the chia seeds,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and some fruit,
and mix it together

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.210 align:middle line:84%
with water, which
I do sometimes.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, Helen
did this for us.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.433 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
Helen is, but Helen

00:30:30.433 --> 00:30:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is sort of the guardian
angel of the Gabriel Method.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:84%
She created these
sort of starter packs,

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:84%
because every time
I do these seminars,

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.130 align:middle line:84%
people are like,
where do you get this?

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get that?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.740 align:middle line:84%
You can get most of this stuff
from your health food store,

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
but this is a
starter pack that she

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:84%
created that has pretty much
everything you need for a week.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.580 align:middle line:84%
It's got some whey
protein powder,

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.872 align:middle line:90%
and I recommend that you have--

00:30:47.872 --> 00:30:49.455 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
use protein powder,

00:30:49.455 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and especially if
you're a vegetarian,

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.850 align:middle line:84%
you really, really
need protein powder.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.690 align:middle line:84%
This is just unsweetened,
unflavored whey protein powder.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:58.230 align:middle line:84%
You can do so many
things with it.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.362 align:middle line:90%
You can make it sweet.

00:30:59.362 --> 00:31:00.320 align:middle line:90%
You can make it savory.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.612 align:middle line:90%
It could be in salad dressings.

00:31:01.612 --> 00:31:03.320 align:middle line:90%
It could be in French toast.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.233 align:middle line:90%
You can bake with it.

00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's a good
way to get protein

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:90%
in pretty much everything.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.203 align:middle line:84%
It has no taste and no
flavor, so it'll just

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:11.755 align:middle line:84%
take on whatever taste
or flavor that you have.

00:31:11.755 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
She gives you like a
week's worth of xylitol.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Some flax seeds, which
you have to ground up,

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.185 align:middle line:90%
and some chia seeds.

00:31:20.185 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you guys are interested,
because I always get

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:90%
that question, so that's there.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And there it goes.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Who's next?

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You may have answered
my question previously,

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but I have a problem
with fish oil.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:84%
After several days,
I develop reflux.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Due to that, I have to stop.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
I do include fish in my diet
at least three to four times

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.820 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:90%
The other problem is krill oil.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I live in a country area,
and I'm having difficulty

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:90%
locating where to purchase it.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Krill oil you can get online.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And it might have to
come from overseas,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:90%
but it'll come in a capsule.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:90%
So you can get krill oil online.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.078 align:middle line:84%
That's where I
would look for it.

00:32:11.078 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
have fish oils, then

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.230 align:middle line:84%
make sure you have lots
of cold water fish.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Emphasis is cold water.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Try not to deep fry it.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.335 align:middle line:84%
Just cook it as
minimally as possible.

00:32:20.335 --> 00:32:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And make sure you get lots
of ground linseeds, flax

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:90%
seeds, some other.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.720 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to have nuts,
some nuts have omega-3s.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Walnuts are a good
source of omega-3s.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.585 align:middle line:84%
But get the nuts
whole in their shell.

00:32:30.585 --> 00:32:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Any time you have nuts, get
them whole and in their shell,

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.273 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise the fat
gets corrupted very easily.

00:32:38.273 --> 00:32:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And eating corrupted fat isn't
doing anything for anybody.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:42.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just toxic.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to get omega-3s
in an uncorrupted form.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.715 align:middle line:90%
>> Jon, thanks mate.

00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I've done really well
with your method,

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.825 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of people,
like friends and family,

00:32:51.825 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:84%
that I see would do
really, really well

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.088 align:middle line:84%
to have your teachings
incorporated into their life.

00:32:57.088 --> 00:32:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to them about
it, I sort of throw it at them.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.933 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be interesting to
hear any opinion you have

00:33:01.933 --> 00:33:04.100 align:middle line:84%
on how to introduce it to
people without being like,

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.730 align:middle line:84%
ah, Jon Gabriel, and
you have to do it,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.118 align:middle line:84%
and you have to read all this,
and you know what I mean?

00:33:08.118 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so your question is how
do you introduce it to people?

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good question.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Without sort of really
pushing it on them.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.990 align:middle line:90%
And letting it start soft.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a really
good question,

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because I remember
I had one lady say,

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm buying this for my
son as a birthday present.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.548 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't talk to her
for a year afterwards.

00:33:27.548 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can't just go
up to someone and say here,

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I think this is for you.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.900 align:middle line:90%
People don't like that.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So you really just
have to kind of stick

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.520 align:middle line:84%
with your own experience and
just have the book visible.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Have it somewhere
visible for them.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And then just when they're--
mention how much it's helped

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.830 align:middle line:90%
you and how it's a great book.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.872 align:middle line:84%
And you know, tell them
to listen to the CD.

00:33:48.872 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Usually just
listening to the CD is

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:90%
enough to get someone started.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Jon, I wanted
to ask you please,

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
do hormonal changes in
menopausal women cause weight

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:90%
gain?

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And does your method
still apply in that case?

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The answer to that
question is yes it can.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Not always, but yes it can.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought it
was because of the estrogen

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:84%
changes causing
insulin resistance,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.679 align:middle line:84%
but I've been working with
a doctor in the States, Dr.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.469 align:middle line:84%
Howard Liebowitz, who's
probably the world authority

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:26.040 align:middle line:90%
on natural hormone balancing.

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And he really explained
to me that it's actually

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
the stress of the menopause that
can cause insulin resistance.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And he works with women all
the time to naturally balance

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:90%
their hormones.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm now doing his radio show
with him every first Wednesday

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:90%
of the week--

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.804 align:middle line:90%
of the month.

00:34:45.804 --> 00:34:48.179 align:middle line:84%
First Wednesday of the month,
I do a radio show with him.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Hormones
Spoken Here."

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I recommend that you go on
that show and you call in.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.370 align:middle line:84%
If you were living in Santa
Monica, California where

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:84%
he is, it would take
you I don't know

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.077 align:middle line:84%
how many weeks to get
an appointment with him,

00:35:00.077 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and how much it would cost, but
he will answer your questions

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:90%
right there on the spot.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And so any type of
hormone-related issues,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.870 align:middle line:84%
especially for menopause,
I would go on his show.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:16.157 align:middle line:84%
It's Dr. Howard Liebowitz,
"Hormones Spoken Here."

00:35:16.157 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:90%
But I want to-- we're going to--

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:21.350 align:middle line:84%
after lunch, I'm going to answer
a lot of general questions,

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:23.040 align:middle line:84%
but I want to stick
to right now--

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to stick to different
ways of getting omega-3s

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in your diet and different
things that can activate--

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.710 align:middle line:84%
physical stresses that can
activate the fat programs.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll talk
about a lot more

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.720 align:middle line:90%
about just general questions.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So any general questions you
have we'll do after lunch.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.852 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:38.852 --> 00:35:41.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I had sort of two questions.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.670 align:middle line:84%
The first one was actually
where does xylitol come from?

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is I've
just been put on to a--

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I have a problem with
reflux with fish oils,

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.975 align:middle line:84%
and I've just been put
onto an enteric-coated one.

00:35:53.975 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Say that again, you had
what kind of coated one?

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:56.975 align:middle line:90%
>> An enteric-coated.

00:35:56.975 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So it goes through your stomach
into your lower intestine

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.290 align:middle line:90%
so you don't get reflux.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:04.035 align:middle line:90%
Did you guys hear that?

00:36:04.035 --> 00:36:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
something I didn't know.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.478 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain type of fish
oil-- what type of fish oil

00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:08.550 align:middle line:90%
is that?

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The brand is
called Biceuticals.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:90%
B-I-C-E-U-T-I-C-A-L-S.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Bioceuticals.

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No, just biceuticals.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:18.665 align:middle line:90%
Not bio, biceuticals.

00:36:18.665 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, it's biceuticals, yeah.

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Ultra clean, EPA/DHA plus.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:24.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I got it from my chemist,
who does naturopathy.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you have acid
reflux problems,

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:31.980 align:middle line:90%
there is an alternative.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.310 align:middle line:90%
That's good to know.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Where does
xylitol come where?

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Xylitol comes from
corn cobs and birch bark.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
derive it from.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Two quick questions.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Is flax seed oil
an OK alternative

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.440 align:middle line:84%
to grinding and how much
should you have of it?

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is I
don't eat animal protein

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and I'm dairy intolerant,
so the whey protein's

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.360 align:middle line:90%
not so good either.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:90%
So what should I have?

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Two really great questions.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Flax seed oil you have
to be really tricky with,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.880 align:middle line:84%
because once it becomes an oil,
it becomes rancid very quickly.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So you have to eat it within
four months of production.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Usually they give you a year.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:12.988 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
expiration date,

00:37:12.988 --> 00:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
they usually give you a
year for the expiry date.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.370 align:middle line:84%
You want it within four
months of production,

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.895 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be
kept refrigerated.

00:37:18.895 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have
a couple of tablespoons

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:21.760 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But no, it's not the
best alternative.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's much better to
grind your flax seeds.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.405 align:middle line:90%
And what was the other question?

00:37:30.405 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> An alternative to whey.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> An alternative to whey.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.160 align:middle line:84%
If you're a vegetarian,
it's really essential

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.823 align:middle line:84%
to get certain
things in your diet.

00:37:39.823 --> 00:37:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get them
in your diet, what happens

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:43.790 align:middle line:84%
is you just are
hungry all the time

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and you end up craving things
like bread and carbohydrates.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the thing goes awry,
so you want to have protein.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.882 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.882 --> 00:37:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Something called
nutritional yeast,

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.750 align:middle line:84%
which is a really good
source of B vitamins,

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.423 align:middle line:84%
and freshly-squeezed
wheatgrass juice.

00:38:01.423 --> 00:38:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Which, freshly squeezed
wheatgrass juice

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.540 align:middle line:84%
is the best source of
vitality out there.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But it also has lots
of trace nutrients

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:90%
that you get from meat.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.883 align:middle line:84%
If you have those three things,
you can be a vegetarian.

00:38:12.883 --> 00:38:15.717 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's a disaster
being a vegetarian.

00:38:15.717 --> 00:38:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's another
source of protein

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that I think is a really
good vegetarian one.

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a rice bran protein
powder from SunWarrior.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.328 align:middle line:84%
It's called SunWarrior
Rice Protein Powder.

00:38:27.328 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good one.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.222 align:middle line:90%
I recommend that one.

00:38:30.222 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE]
spirulina is also--

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Spirulina is an excellent
source of protein and trace

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:36.870 align:middle line:90%
nutrients.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:39.150 align:middle line:90%
People hate it.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.677 align:middle line:90%
I happen to really like it.

00:38:40.677 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people, if they
taste it, they're

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.080 align:middle line:84%
going to spit it out
right on the spot.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's green, and it
goes all over the place.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.560 align:middle line:90%
It's gross.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a mess.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I recommend, if you can eat
spirulina, I recommended it.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Some people take
it in capsule form.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.650 align:middle line:84%
You can take like five or
10 grams in capsule form

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.283 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll notice
is throughout the day

00:38:58.283 --> 00:39:00.325 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be much
less hungry, because it's

00:39:00.325 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:84%
a great way to
nourish your body.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, thanks for that.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Just one question.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I am lactose intolerant
and fructose malabsorptive.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait, lactose intolerant and?

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Fructose malabsorptive.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Which means it cuts out
most of the stuff I can eat.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, most of the
stuff you can eat.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Most of the sugars you can eat.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, but it
cuts out most of my fruit.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.495 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can only eat
bananas and sometimes oranges.

00:39:27.495 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I would recommend a
couple of things then.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.170 align:middle line:84%
First of all, and I'm
glad you mentioned

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that, another reason why our
fat programs get activated

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.350 align:middle line:84%
is because we lose the ability
to digest and assimilate

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:38.967 align:middle line:90%
nutrients properly.

00:39:38.967 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend,
there's certain things

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.090 align:middle line:90%
that aid in digestion.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:90%
One is probiotics.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:50.690 align:middle line:90%


00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Probiotics.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And one is digestive enzymes.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.380 align:middle line:90%


00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Probiotics and digestive
enzymes will help

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.850 align:middle line:90%
you digest certain nutrients.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.340 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we lose the
ability to digest nutrients

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:84%
is because all the
foods we eat don't

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:84%
have the necessary
enzymes in them,

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and when you take
things like antibiotics

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and chlorinated
water, over time,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
you lose the friendly
bacteria in your body

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
called probiotics,
the friendly bacteria

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that are necessary for
digesting nutrients.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend that
you take probiotics

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.510 align:middle line:84%
in the morning first
thing on an empty stomach.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Having digestive
enzymes, for example,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.430 align:middle line:84%
will help you digest
lactose, because it's

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:38.300 align:middle line:84%
got digestive enzymes in it like
lactase that will digest it,

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and all the different fruit
sugars you can't digest,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.615 align:middle line:90%
it'll help you digest those too.

00:40:42.615 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend that
you take probiotics

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
in the morning and digestive
enzymes on an empty--

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.390 align:middle line:84%
with meals maybe for
a couple of weeks.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.360 align:middle line:84%
But the probiotics I
think is an ongoing thing.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.902 align:middle line:84%
There's other ways
to get probiotics.

00:40:54.902 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
You can get probiotics
from any fermented foods,

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:03.830 align:middle line:84%
like nutritional yeast,
like miso and tamari, which

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:04.850 align:middle line:90%
are fermented soy.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend that
you take soy in general,

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.320 align:middle line:90%
unless it's fermented.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And/or apple cider
vinegar with your water.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Put some apple cider
vinegar in your water.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.550 align:middle line:84%
All these things have
friendly bacteria.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever
take antibiotics,

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.440 align:middle line:84%
it's important that
you take probiotics

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:84%
for at least a couple
of months afterwards.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to ask
about the protein powder.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I find it convenient in
the morning having a shake.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You said in the book that
you purchased one that

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.060 align:middle line:90%
is like from a sheep's milk.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's really hard to get.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.683 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really hard to get.

00:41:39.683 --> 00:41:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do you get it from?

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's really hard to get.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:43.850 align:middle line:84%
At the moment I've
been sourcing it.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to get
sheep's protein in abundance.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:90%
So you just do the best you can.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.682 align:middle line:84%
We've got now, we've
got a shake that we just

00:41:51.682 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:84%
made, a chocolate shake,
which you're all going

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:90%
to get to taste later today.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.035 align:middle line:84%
That's just whey from cow,
and it's got chia seeds

00:42:00.035 --> 00:42:02.005 align:middle line:84%
and xylitol, and it's
just ready to mix.

00:42:02.005 --> 00:42:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in
a hurry, you just

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:06.170 align:middle line:84%
put a couple of
tablespoons in some water.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.940 align:middle line:84%
You're done, and you've got
a really good breakfast.

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
to stop one thing

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and talk just a little bit
more about how important it

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is to keep your blood sugar
stable in the morning.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.773 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to us normally,
when our fat programs are on

00:42:21.773 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're not able to
balance our blood sugar,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:25.523 align:middle line:84%
is we're usually not
hungry in the mornings.

00:42:25.523 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:90%


00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.758 align:middle line:84%
What happens is we're usually
not hungry in the morning.

00:42:34.758 --> 00:42:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So we don't eat in the morning.

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is our blood
sugar is here in the morning,

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.113 align:middle line:84%
and then it goes lower, and
lower, and lower, and lower,

00:42:41.113 --> 00:42:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and lower.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And around 11 o'clock,
this is where you're at.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:90%
You're famished.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you've got
to have a donut or something

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.785 align:middle line:90%
sweet, some coffee or something.

00:42:50.785 --> 00:42:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you eat
something sweet,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and boom, you get the
blood sugar spike.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then all day,
you end up like this.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's totally essential,
even if you're not

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.600 align:middle line:90%
hungry in the beginning.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.142 align:middle line:84%
Eventually this
whole-- all the rules

00:43:03.142 --> 00:43:05.860 align:middle line:84%
go out the window once your
body's functioning properly.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning,
it's essential

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.840 align:middle line:84%
that you have a really good
breakfast with these three

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.090 align:middle line:84%
components like this
one which I'm going

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.380 align:middle line:90%
to let you taste very soon.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.197 align:middle line:90%
Which is very good, by the way.

00:43:16.197 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is when
you eat a breakfast that's

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.180 align:middle line:84%
got protein, omega-3s,
and live food,

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.020 align:middle line:84%
this is what your
blood sugar does.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:90%
It goes real stable like this.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So at 12 o'clock,
you're here, not here.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
at lunch, you're

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.030 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to make
another good food choice,

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.860 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
exhausted and starving.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So now you can choose foods
like some sort of meat, chicken,

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:41.850 align:middle line:90%
fish, salad.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Put ground flax seeds on it.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And have good food again.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.873 align:middle line:84%
And then you go like this again
until around 3, 4 o'clock.

00:43:48.873 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Which by the way,
it's essential to have

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:84%
a snack in the beginning
around 3 or 4 o'clock.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.945 align:middle line:84%
You have to be proactive
with your blood sugar.

00:43:55.945 --> 00:43:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait for it
to get too low.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.778 align:middle line:84%
Don't wait till
you get too hungry.

00:43:58.778 --> 00:44:01.567 align:middle line:84%
Because once it happens,
it happens like that.

00:44:01.567 --> 00:44:02.650 align:middle line:90%
So keep your blood sugars.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So around 3 or 4
o'clock, whatever

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:84%
you're eating for lunch,
save another 20% or 30% of it

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and eat the same
thing two hours later.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So right around here
is 3 or 4 o'clock.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.460 align:middle line:90%
You eat something else.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Around dinner, you're here.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%
This is where you are at
dinner as opposed to here.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you're here
at dinner, and you

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.702 align:middle line:84%
go past 40 different
drive-throughs, you know,

00:44:28.702 --> 00:44:30.660 align:middle line:84%
there's no way you're
making it home for dinner

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.940 align:middle line:90%
without driving through.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And then you get this.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you feel bad at the
end because you've such a--

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.505 align:middle line:90%


00:44:39.505 --> 00:44:40.380 align:middle line:90%
where'd you go, Jack?

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.920 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.750 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Take my word for it.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Then you feel bad at
the end of the day.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up
having a big ol' pig out,

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and simply because
you're not keeping

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:56.910 align:middle line:90%
your blood sugar stable.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So keep your blood sugar
stable in the very beginning

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.020 align:middle line:90%
at breakfast.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Start with breakfast.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And then eat around 3 or 4
o'clock, also after lunch.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Keep your blood sugar
stable throughout the day

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.440 align:middle line:90%
with foods at every meal.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Where's the omega-3s?

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:12.913 align:middle line:90%
Where's the fatty acids?

00:45:12.913 --> 00:45:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Where's the live food?

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:15.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.987 align:middle line:84%
I'll take a couple
more questions.

00:45:16.987 --> 00:45:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I work a lot with pharmacists
and krill oil is available

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:25.500 align:middle line:90%
in most.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the pharmacist
naturopath specialist's skills

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.570 align:middle line:84%
are recommending
liquid fish oil.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons is that
krill is the food that dolphins

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and whales eat, so they're
worried about the depletion

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.820 align:middle line:90%
in the sea about that.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So they're talking about
liquid fish oil as well.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's an environmental
issue about the food chain

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.552 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:45:56.552 --> 00:45:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But as far as for your
own personal body,

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:84%
it's probably the best thing
you can put in your body.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little
bit of a trade-off

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.910 align:middle line:84%
there, and that's
something be considered.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But it is definitely the best
oil you can put in your body.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree with
liquid fish oil,

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:14.040 align:middle line:84%
because when it's a liquid form,
it's more likely to go rancid.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And rancid-omega
3s are just toxic.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.740 align:middle line:84%
You have to have them
in a non-toxic form.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I just had a query
about, you talk about

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.710 align:middle line:84%
toxins and eliminating
them from the body.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
wondering, would you

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.100 align:middle line:84%
recommend taking a
multivitamin each day?

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know which
multivitamin is the best

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:38.630 align:middle line:90%
to take?

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think you--

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I know I recommend
that in the book.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you have to
take a multivitamin every day

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.885 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're getting
a lot of live food.

00:46:43.885 --> 00:46:46.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting live, organic
food in your diet every day,

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.040 align:middle line:84%
you're getting all the
vitamins and nutrients,

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.540 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
getting freshly

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.715 align:middle line:90%
squeezed wheatgrass juice.

00:46:50.715 --> 00:46:52.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting
that every day,

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:54.970 align:middle line:84%
or some spirulina every
day, you don't necessarily

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.380 align:middle line:90%
need multivitamins.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Who's next?

00:46:58.330 --> 00:46:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:46:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I was just wondering, do you
have a preference for grazing

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.625 align:middle line:84%
rather than having specific
meals throughout the day?

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Is there a benefit
to one or the other?

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.038 align:middle line:84%
I think that grazing
is fine and is good.

00:47:13.038 --> 00:47:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's going to keep
your blood sugar stable.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:84%
What I think is
really important is

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:18.157 align:middle line:84%
to have a really,
really good breakfast.

00:47:18.157 --> 00:47:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The risk with grazing
is that you're not

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:84%
hungry in the morning, and
so you're not going to eat.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying you have
to eat in the morning

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.740 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Right now, like for me, I
might not eat in the morning.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.853 align:middle line:84%
Like yesterday, I didn't
eat till 4 o'clock.

00:47:31.853 --> 00:47:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's just because
I was busy doing

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.310 align:middle line:84%
a lot of other things that
were keeping me occupied.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.777 align:middle line:90%
And then when I ate, I ate.

00:47:37.777 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And then I ate throughout.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Once your body can
regain the ability

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.120 align:middle line:84%
to burn fat and regulate
your blood sugar,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.860 align:middle line:90%
all the rules go out the window.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning, you've
got to understand that

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:51.253 align:middle line:84%
you're different right now than
the way you're-- than, quote,

00:47:51.253 --> 00:47:53.545 align:middle line:84%
"naturally thin people" or
the way your body's supposed

00:47:53.545 --> 00:47:54.160 align:middle line:90%
to function.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
make adjustments.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.552 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing is,
even if you're not hungry,

00:47:57.552 --> 00:47:59.118 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have
a good breakfast.

00:47:59.118 --> 00:48:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you do have
to eat something

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.035 align:middle line:84%
around 3 or 4
o'clock, and you do

00:48:02.035 --> 00:48:04.990 align:middle line:84%
have to be proactive
with your blood sugar.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.667 align:middle line:84%
I've just got a quick
question about live foods.

00:48:13.667 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:84%
You recommend in the
book, and here as well,

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.420 align:middle line:84%
about eating as much live
foods, fruits, vegetables,

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But as you were talking
about, 10,000 years ago

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.720 align:middle line:84%
obviously our fruits
and vegetables

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.383 align:middle line:84%
were much more natural,
and much more--

00:48:26.383 --> 00:48:27.800 align:middle line:84%
we would gain much
more nutrients.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.600 align:middle line:90%
What about now?

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it more towards
organic, or just generally

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.190 align:middle line:90%
try and get as many as you can?

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Number one is the best type
of live foods are organic,

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:39.698 align:middle line:90%
locally grown, in-season.

00:48:39.698 --> 00:48:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you go to
a farmer's market,

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.320 align:middle line:90%
sometimes they're the cheapest.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Not always, but sometimes
they're the cheapest.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:84%
If you go to a farmer's
market and they're just

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.763 align:middle line:84%
kind of spray-free, maybe
they're not certified organic,

00:48:49.763 --> 00:48:50.930 align:middle line:90%
they're just a local person.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But they've never had any
toxins in their garden,

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're growing, and
it's the cheapest food.

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:58.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the food your body
needs because it's in season.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.940 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't imported from the
other side of the world.

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Locally grown, in-season
organic is the best you get.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people say
organic costs a lot of money.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's true,
but so does dealing

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.597 align:middle line:90%
with toxins in your body.

00:49:12.597 --> 00:49:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The medications that you have
to take because you've got

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:16.340 align:middle line:90%
too many toxins in your body.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.340 align:middle line:84%
The weight problems that
you have because you've

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.750 align:middle line:84%
got too many toxins
in your body.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:24.047 align:middle line:84%
And all of the different
physical ailments

00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that you have all the
time, because you have

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.170 align:middle line:90%
too many toxins in your body.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:84%
All those things
cost a lot of money,

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and they go away when
you eat more healthy,

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.250 align:middle line:90%
live organic food.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:38.030 align:middle line:84%
You also end up spending
less on food eventually.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:40.460 align:middle line:84%
The reason is, when you're
nourishing your body,

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.840 align:middle line:90%
you crave less food.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.580 align:middle line:84%
Because your brain is listening
to your stomach, you eat less.

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So when you address the issue
by getting more organic foods,

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.050 align:middle line:84%
eventually you will
save money on food.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Not in the beginning,
but eventually.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend making the effort
to get organic, especially

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:00.230 align:middle line:90%
locally grown.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:02.292 align:middle line:84%
Find out where the
farmer's markets are.

00:50:02.292 --> 00:50:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Learn how to grow wheatgrass.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a video, we
haven't put it out yet,

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:06.490 align:middle line:90%
on how to grow wheatgrass.

00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:08.823 align:middle line:84%
It's the cheapest thing in
the world to grow wheatgrass,

00:50:08.823 --> 00:50:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and it's easy.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Have fresh-squeezed
wheatgrass every day.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You will be amazed
at how much food--

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.310 align:middle line:84%
how much less food you need when
you have a shot of wheatgrass

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:17.210 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:19.127 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply because
you've given your body

00:50:19.127 --> 00:50:21.260 align:middle line:84%
specific nutrients that
it is starving for,

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:27.628 align:middle line:84%
that you can't get in
cinnamon buns, and bagels,

00:50:27.628 --> 00:50:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and all the foods we
eat in drive-throughs.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And you just can't get it.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you
can't get it, your body

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.988 align:middle line:84%
is starving, and starving,
and starving for it.

00:50:33.988 --> 00:50:37.325 align:middle line:90%


00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:39.200 align:middle line:84%
You're cheating, but
I'll take your question.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.000 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:40.980 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:41.780 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:42.677 align:middle line:90%
What's your question?

00:50:42.677 --> 00:50:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Is wheatgrass gluten free?

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Is wheatgrass gluten free?

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm really glad you asked that.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, wheatgrass is gluten free.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Wheatgrass is a sprout.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have gluten in it.

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Gluten is a very harmful
substance in wheat.

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
mention one other thing.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Hey Jack, you going to get
this thing to work for me?

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Is it working up there?

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not working on my screen.

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:05.020 align:middle line:84%
I just want to mention one other
thing about wheat in general.

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Wheat products, and
invented products

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:84%
like grains in general, is that
when you eat a piece of bread,

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:84%
you get a three times greater
insulin response than you

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.360 align:middle line:90%
do with live food like fruits.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
when you get that, it's

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.710 align:middle line:84%
called an exaggerated
insulin response,

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and when you get an
exaggerated insulin response,

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
over time, what happens
is your cells stop

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.580 align:middle line:90%
listening to insulin.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The same way that if
you were in a concert,

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.477 align:middle line:84%
and the music was really loud,
your ears would become deaf.

00:51:36.477 --> 00:51:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So when the insulin is
really loud in your system,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.150 align:middle line:90%
your cells become deaf.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:41.690 align:middle line:90%
They become resistant.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So simply by eating
invented foods

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and causing that exaggerated
insulin response,

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.600 align:middle line:90%
you get this insulin resistance.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, am I telling you to
cut out breads, and grains,

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:55.745 align:middle line:90%
and all invented foods?

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I would love more than anything
else in the world for you

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.380 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.430 align:middle line:90%
But I know it's not reality.

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:02.910 align:middle line:90%
So don't cut them out.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Add.

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Add, add, add, add live foods.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Add real foods.

00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Add omega-3s.

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Add these foods.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Be aware of the fact that
all invented foods, anything

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:84%
we've ever invented, except
for super foods, which

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.520 align:middle line:84%
are specifically for
nutrients, but anything

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:84%
we've ever invented for
taste or convenience

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:23.260 align:middle line:84%
is causing hormonal
chaos in your body

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and causing yourself
to gain weight.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Don't cut it out.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Add these.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:27.692 align:middle line:90%
Add the other good foods.

00:52:27.692 --> 00:52:30.783 align:middle line:84%
Become aware that you don't
need those other foods.

00:52:30.783 --> 00:52:32.450 align:middle line:84%
They have no nutrients
in them, and they

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:34.355 align:middle line:84%
cause hormonal chaos
that cause your body

00:52:34.355 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:90%
to activate the fat programs.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you will find
you crave them less.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very,
very, very rare for me

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that I ever crave anything
that's been invented anymore.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there was a
time when I couldn't

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:84%
go a day without having
bread, or pizza, or pasta,

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.620 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:90%
They're just invented food.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Over time, you trend toward
regaining a natural rhythm

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:57.040 align:middle line:90%
eating natural foods.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.790 align:middle line:90%
I've got a question.

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I eat pretty well except for
right about 9 o'clock at night.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being a
vampire and wanting blood,

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I just want
carbohydrates or bread.

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:08.252 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:53:08.252 --> 00:53:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That's called--
there's a term for it.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.750 align:middle line:90%
They call it nighttime eating.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And I had that.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's an intentional
act on your body

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:16.127 align:middle line:84%
to cause you to gain weight
when your fat programs are on,

00:53:16.127 --> 00:53:19.350 align:middle line:84%
because eating at night is
the best way to gain weight.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is when you
eat before you go to sleep,

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.815 align:middle line:90%
your digestion shuts down.

00:53:25.815 --> 00:53:27.190 align:middle line:84%
In general, when
you go to sleep,

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:28.310 align:middle line:90%
your digestion shuts down.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.380 align:middle line:84%
When you eat before
you go to sleep,

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.590 align:middle line:84%
your digestion shuts down and
your insulin levels become

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:90%
elevated.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole night, you've
got elevated insulin levels

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.580 align:middle line:84%
causing you to
make fat all night.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're making fat while
you sleep all night if you

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.400 align:middle line:90%
eat before you go to sleep.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You can eat the same
amount in a day,

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.548 align:middle line:84%
and if you eat it during the
day, you will lose weight.

00:53:49.548 --> 00:53:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat it at night,
you will gain weight.

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not about calories
in and calories out.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It's about how
your body responds

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.750 align:middle line:84%
to certain hormonal
changes when you eat foods.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So before you go to
sleep, when you eat,

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.665 align:middle line:84%
your insulin levels
stay elevated all night.

00:54:04.665 --> 00:54:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you eat first thing
in the morning for breakfast,

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and you eat throughout
the day, hopefully you

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.540 align:middle line:90%
have an early dinner.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Then for the next three hours,
hopefully you're not hungry.

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Drink a lot of water.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.463 align:middle line:84%
If you're not hungry
at night, that's a sign

00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:90%
your body wants to lose weight.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is your
insulin levels lower.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to sleep,
you burn fat all night.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you burn
fat, when you sleep.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people to
drink a lot of water

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:27.930 align:middle line:90%
before they go to sleep.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.472 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, I'm up
all night going to the bathroom.

00:54:30.472 --> 00:54:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.102 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the best
thing in the world.

00:54:33.102 --> 00:54:35.590 align:middle line:84%
But guess what
you're eliminating?

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:36.548 align:middle line:90%
You're eliminating fat.

00:54:36.548 --> 00:54:38.298 align:middle line:84%
That's how your body
burns fat, and that's

00:54:38.298 --> 00:54:39.320 align:middle line:90%
how it eliminates it.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good thing when
you're losing weight.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:44.530 align:middle line:90%
So become aware.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.655 align:middle line:84%
When people say to me, I
used to be hungry at night

00:54:46.655 --> 00:54:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not anymore,
that's a signal

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:49.980 align:middle line:84%
that your fat programs
are getting turned off,

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.897 align:middle line:84%
that your body doesn't
want to be fat anymore.

00:54:51.897 --> 00:54:54.015 align:middle line:84%
But as long as it wants
to be hungry at night,

00:54:54.015 --> 00:54:56.140 align:middle line:84%
it means that your body
wants to hold on to weight.

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.872 align:middle line:84%
Start by eating in the morning
lots of nutritious foods.

00:54:58.872 --> 00:55:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Have some super foods
also, like some spirulina

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.650 align:middle line:84%
or wheatgrass first
thing in the morning.

00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Notice if you're
still hungry at night.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Did you have another question?

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:07.512 align:middle line:90%
>> I was going to--

00:55:07.512 --> 00:55:09.470 align:middle line:84%
you've just answered--
I was going to say maybe

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:11.630 align:middle line:84%
instead of having a
carb snack after dinner

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:13.700 align:middle line:84%
when I'm not really
hungry, I'm just craving,

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.050 align:middle line:90%
should I have one of those?

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.258 align:middle line:90%
>> You can have one of those.

00:55:16.258 --> 00:55:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Like the shake.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:19.010 align:middle line:84%
I think Helen made some of these
shake mixes, which I'm going

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.177 align:middle line:90%
to make for you after lunch.

00:55:20.177 --> 00:55:21.560 align:middle line:90%
There's a chocolate shake.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.788 align:middle line:90%
Just have one of those.

00:55:22.788 --> 00:55:23.955 align:middle line:90%
It's a million times better.

00:55:23.955 --> 00:55:25.247 align:middle line:90%
>> So your insulin gets better?

00:55:25.247 --> 00:55:28.203 align:middle line:84%
>> You won't have the same
insulin response, no, as carbs.

00:55:28.203 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But do you eat breakfast
in the morning?

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but I train for about
half an hour before I eat

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.220 align:middle line:90%
breakfast.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> You do what?

00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Like exercise first.

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> But what type of
breakfast do you have?

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Just a protein drink.

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:40.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:41.360 align:middle line:90%
All right, well, try this.

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.207 align:middle line:90%
Try the shake.

00:55:42.207 --> 00:55:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like a chocolate shake,
and you can just have that,

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have the
same insulin response.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.930 align:middle line:90%
It's got lots of nutrients.

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, about the flax seeds.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.150 align:middle line:84%
You said freshly
ground flax seeds.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.048 align:middle line:84%
Can you grind them in the
morning for a full day,

00:56:01.048 --> 00:56:03.090 align:middle line:84%
or do they have to be
ground directly before use?

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You can grind your
flax seeds in the morning,

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and then take them with you and
sprinkle them on everything.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that just every
day, or can you--

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You need omega-3s every day.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to have flax
seeds every day, or linseeds,

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.635 align:middle line:90%
but you need omega-3s every day.

00:56:16.635 --> 00:56:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Really, preferably
at every meal.

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Every meal, you really
want ask yourself,

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:22.120 align:middle line:84%
where am I getting the omega-3s,
the protein, and the live food?

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Those are the essential things
that you need every single day.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.080 align:middle line:90%


00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to ask about the
digestive enzymes you mentioned

00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:32.950 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So do you need to
take them ongoingly?

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:36.250 align:middle line:84%
When you read your
book, it's says--

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you need to take a
dose of enzymes ongoing?

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:39.755 align:middle line:90%
Take them in the beginning.

00:56:39.755 --> 00:56:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But as you eat more
live food, the live food

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.630 align:middle line:90%
has digestive enzymes in it.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Also, your immune system
gets much stronger,

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and your immune system
competes for those enzymes.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So as your immune system gets
stronger because you have less

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.725 align:middle line:90%
toxins in you, and your body's--

00:56:52.725 --> 00:56:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're having
the proper fats

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're being nourished,
your immune system

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:90%
gets much stronger.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not competing as
much for those enzymes.

00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:00.070 align:middle line:90%
So no.

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.480 align:middle line:84%
You need digestive
enzymes in the beginning

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.355 align:middle line:84%
as a short-term thing,
but you need some sort

00:57:03.355 --> 00:57:05.960 align:middle line:90%
of probiotics ongoing.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I just want to mention the
word salt talk about craving

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:13.130 align:middle line:90%
for salt.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.235 align:middle line:84%
The reason why we crave salt is
because we need trace minerals.

00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem is table salt
doesn't have trace minerals.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just poison that
causes you to be hungry

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and causes a lot
of inflammation.

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The inflammation then
elevates these hormones

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.000 align:middle line:90%
that activate the fat programs.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.230 align:middle line:90%
So table salt is poison.

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:34.312 align:middle line:84%
But real salt is one of the best
things you put in your body.

00:57:34.312 --> 00:57:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's different
salts you can get.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.320 align:middle line:84%
One is called
Himalayan salt crystals

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.247 align:middle line:90%
which have 84 trace minerals.

00:57:41.247 --> 00:57:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I just had one from
New Zealand that I

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:47.450 align:middle line:84%
love it's a volcanic salt.
Tastes, smells terrible.

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:48.710 align:middle line:90%
It's got sulfur in it.

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:49.700 align:middle line:90%
Smells horrible.

00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.013 align:middle line:84%
There's something about it
that I really just love it.

00:57:52.013 --> 00:57:53.430 align:middle line:84%
I think I really
like stinky food.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
figuring out right now.

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get
that, then sea salt.

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.548 align:middle line:90%
And those are perfect.

00:57:59.548 --> 00:58:00.590 align:middle line:90%
They have trace minerals.

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:02.560 align:middle line:90%
You need those trace minerals.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.890 align:middle line:90%
But table salt is poison.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It tricks you into
tasting like something

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.710 align:middle line:84%
that's nutritious but
is not nutritious.

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.412 align:middle line:84%
I'll take one more question, and
then we're going to tie it up

00:58:12.412 --> 00:58:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and I'll feed you guys.

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.770 align:middle line:90%
But I want to say something.

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk for three
questions worth, so.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You seem to be absolutely
opposed to cereals

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:24.910 align:middle line:90%
for breakfast.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:30.090 align:middle line:84%
You're ruining my breakfast
that I have every day.

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a huge bowl of
muesli that I produce myself

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:43.040 align:middle line:84%
from as much natural
food as possible.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.040 align:middle line:90%
I drink probiotics.

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I put flax seed on it.

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I put whey protein on it.

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I put milk on it.

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And really, I'm not
hungry by lunchtime.

00:58:53.350 --> 00:58:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I have this before
5:30 in the morning.

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:58.210 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Keep doing what
you're doing, OK?

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But make the muesli an organic
whole grain type of grain.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.830 align:middle line:90%
It'll be infinitely better.

00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:07.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:09.755 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're-- if
you're going to have grains,

00:59:09.755 --> 00:59:13.270 align:middle line:84%
mix them with protein, omega-3,
and live foods to balance out

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:17.637 align:middle line:84%
the sugar spikes so there's
something behind it afterwards.

00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Doing exactly what you're doing.

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I
would do differently

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.475 align:middle line:84%
is rather than
having milk, I would

00:59:22.475 --> 00:59:24.850 align:middle line:84%
look for an alternative milk
like almond milk, rice milk.

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Not soy milk.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm really against soy.

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Soy elevates your
estrogen levels,

00:59:29.290 --> 00:59:31.060 align:middle line:84%
which causes insulin
resistance, and it

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.710 align:middle line:84%
interferes with
your body's ability

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to digest and assimilate
other nutrients.

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really averse to soy
unless it's fermented soy.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But rice milk, almond
milk, oat milk.

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Have an alternative
to just regular milk,

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.010 align:middle line:84%
because regular milk just
kind of causes inflammation,

00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's not the best
thing in the world.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.775 align:middle line:84%
And you don't necessarily
need yogurt, either.

00:59:48.775 --> 00:59:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The reason-- the one
good thing about yogurt,

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:53.530 align:middle line:90%
it's got probiotics in it.

00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Just a quick comment
and a question.

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:58.600 align:middle line:84%
The comment was
more that there's

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.692 align:middle line:84%
a lot of really good organic
produce delivery people here

01:00:01.692 --> 01:00:03.650 align:middle line:84%
in Melbourne, and you're
actually only spending

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.650 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day
about an extra $2 to $5

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:08.950 align:middle line:84%
a week as to how much you'd
normally spend on your produce.

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So it is quite easy
to get in Melbourne.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:12.977 align:middle line:84%
The other one was
with the chia seeds

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:14.560 align:middle line:84%
for those who worry
about the fishies.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Aren't they supposed to be 17%
higher in omega-3 than the fish

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.650 align:middle line:90%
oil?

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:24.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good source.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Chia seeds are a really
good source of omega-3s.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:28.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a different omega-3.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.945 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher level of
omega-3 than the fish

01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:33.220 align:middle line:90%
oil, which is the EPA and DHA.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
This is called an ALA,
which has to be broken down

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
into EPA and DHA.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody can break
it down perfectly.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.860 align:middle line:90%
That's why I say you need both.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And you need as much different
variety as you can get.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find over time
is that because you're getting

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:50.728 align:middle line:84%
these good fats, you're
just going to-- your body's

01:00:50.728 --> 01:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
going to be functioning so
much better that you're just

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be making good food
choices throughout the day.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll take another
question, yeah.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We've heard from a number
of people who have intolerances

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.080 align:middle line:90%
or allergies.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Have you found in your
feedback in your time

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
doing these seminars that
those change as people

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.920 align:middle line:90%
get nutritionally balanced?

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a lady in Perth about
six months ago come up and give

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
a talk, and we'll have that
talk on the internet soon.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Her name's-- what was--

01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:18.580 align:middle line:90%
where's Helen?

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.170 align:middle line:90%
What was her name?

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm lost without Helen.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this lady
gave a talk, and she

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
said that for the
last 10 years she's

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
been allergic-- she
has celiac disease.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%
She's been allergic
to 99% of all foods.

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
All she could have was
I think eggs and milk

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.010 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:42.500 align:middle line:90%
The video will be on there.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
She used to get these attacks
where she couldn't breathe

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and where it was
life-threatening all the time.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So much so that friends
wouldn't invite her over

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
for any social thing, because
she could just die on the spot.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Her doctors gave her
three months to live.

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
And now it's been a year.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.720 align:middle line:90%
She hasn't had a single attack.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.950 align:middle line:90%
She eats whatever she wants.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And her doctors are
just flabbergasted.

01:02:10.830 --> 01:02:14.102 align:middle line:84%
And there were two main reasons
why she was having a problem.

01:02:14.102 --> 01:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
One, she had a serious
digestive problem.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So I put her on that probiotic
that I just mentioned,

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.470 align:middle line:90%
Primal Defense.

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And stress was causing a
lot of digestive problems.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
The reason why stress
causes digestive problems

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
is because stress diverts
your blood into your muscles

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
away from your
digestion, so you are not

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
able to digest
your food properly.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the food
becomes toxic and rancid.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.500 align:middle line:90%
It leaks into your stomach--

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.010 align:middle line:90%
it leaks into your bloodstream.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes toxic
in your bloodstream.

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Your body builds
up antibodies to it

01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
and you become allergic to it.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
asthma, and Crohn's

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
disease, celiac disease, and
all these digestive problems

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and food allergies.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So by taking a probiotic,
by taking more live foods,

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
by living a lower
stress life, which we're

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.390 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
the next section,

01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
your digestion greatly
repairs itself.

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And then all of these food
allergies and problems go away.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk just for a
couple minutes about something.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:10.720 align:middle line:90%
So we've talked about--

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.520 align:middle line:90%
what's that?

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.143 align:middle line:90%
>> What did I just say?

01:03:15.143 --> 01:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're going to
have to watch the video,

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.602 align:middle line:84%
because I never
remember what I said.

01:03:18.602 --> 01:03:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Stress diverts your blood--
stress diverts blood away from

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.540 align:middle line:90%
your digestion.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when you eat food,
you don't have enough blood

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.920 align:middle line:90%
to digest your food properly.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Your energy is not in
your digestive area.

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The food becomes
rancid and toxic.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It leaks into your
bloodstream and

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that toxic, non-digested food,
we then become allergic to.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a poison, and
we build up antibodies,

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:43.720 align:middle line:90%
and we become allergic to it.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
All that stuff gets
unraveled and gets undone.

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:48.442 align:middle line:84%
This lady's story
was unbelievable.

01:03:48.442 --> 01:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
When you get-- when you
watch her when she's talking,

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have it on
the internet soon,

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:55.620 align:middle line:90%
on gabrielmethod.com.

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an unbelievable story.

01:03:57.850 --> 01:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So dealing with
some of the physical

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
stresses that activate
the fat programs.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Number one is dieting, right?

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:07.937 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are dieting now,
you can't just say, yeah,

01:04:07.937 --> 01:04:09.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the Gabriel Method.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to diet anymore.

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Don't kill the messenger.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you
principles to work with.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you're dieting,
what you've done

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
is you're artificially keeping
your set point at a lower rate,

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
like holding a
volleyball underwater.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.210 align:middle line:90%
And the second you let go, poof.

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you've lost 20 kilos or 40
pounds by dieting, and you go,

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I don't have
to diet anymore.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Those 20 kilos,
that 40 pounds are

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.380 align:middle line:90%
going to come back like that.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a lot of
people tell me that.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.652 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, their
body stabilizes

01:04:44.652 --> 01:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and they start
losing weight again.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:48.135 align:middle line:84%
So what I recommend is
if you are dieting now,

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:52.440 align:middle line:84%
if you're actively restricting
your intake, transition.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Spend six months transitioning.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Don't change what you're
doing, but add foods

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:58.585 align:middle line:90%
that you're starving for.

01:04:58.585 --> 01:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Deal with the other
issues in your life

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.085 align:middle line:84%
which we're going to
talk about next section,

01:05:02.085 --> 01:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
the mental and emotional
issues, and transition

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
over a six-month period into
a more healthy lifestyle.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
As your body deals
with the real issues,

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:14.020 align:middle line:84%
whether it's digestion,
or nutritional famine,

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.870 align:middle line:84%
or mental and emotional
stress, or toxins,

01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
whatever the issue
is, or medications,

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
over time as you're
able to deal with that,

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
then your set point will
go down to the level

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that you're artificially
keeping your weight at.

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens, you can
make the transition easier.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So don't make too many
changes in the beginning.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Spend six months transitioning.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
There's one other thing
I want to talk about as

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
far as from a
physical stress that

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:41.520 align:middle line:90%
can activate the fat programs.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Something called sleep apnea.

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, sleep apnea is
something that happens,

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.110 align:middle line:90%
a vicious cycle that happens.

01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
If your fat programs
get activated

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
through some sort of
stress in your life,

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
you start gaining
weight, gaining weight,

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:54.810 align:middle line:90%
and gaining weight.

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you develop
something called sleep apnea.

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And sleep apnea happens
when you gain weight

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
because the weight of
your neck and chest

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
overcome the pressure
of your windpipe.

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you're sleeping,
you're choking all the time.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.070 align:middle line:84%
At my heaviest, I had
a 50-centimeter neck,

01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.380 align:middle line:90%
or 22 inches.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I was laying, I
was choking all the time.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you're choking all
the time, you don't know it,

01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:21.525 align:middle line:84%
but you're not getting
into a deep enough sleep.

01:06:21.525 --> 01:06:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And that does a
couple of things.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:24.730 align:middle line:90%
One, you're tired all the time.

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I was exhausted night and day.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, when I was at a
red light, the only way I

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.070 align:middle line:90%
knew that it was time to--

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that there was a green light
was I'd get a beep from someone

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
behind me, because
I'd be asleep.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd be in meetings
falling asleep

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.970 align:middle line:90%
when I was the one talking.

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I was a walking zombie.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I was tired all the time.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
tired all the time,

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any
energy to exercise.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
You have no energy to
take care of your life.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, to make a good living
and have great relationships

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:52.550 align:middle line:90%
with people.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.730 align:middle line:90%
You have no energy for that.

01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.690 align:middle line:90%
Forget about that.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.523 align:middle line:84%
And you're craving
junk food all the time,

01:06:58.523 --> 01:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only
way to get energy.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You know how you feel when
you've been traveling for three

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:03.035 align:middle line:90%
days and you haven't slept?

01:07:03.035 --> 01:07:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You need junk food all the
time just to keep going.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And the worst part of it is it
elevates your cortisol levels.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And elevated cortisol
levels is what

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
happens when you're
starving in a famine.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Elevated cortisol levels
activate your fat programs.

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:21.200 align:middle line:84%
If you give a mouse cortisol
over a two-year period,

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
he'll grow to three
times his size.

01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
If you give a doctor who tells
you to eat less cortisol,

01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:27.800 align:middle line:90%
guess what?

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
He ain't going to
be eating less.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
He's going to gain
weight for as long

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:32.950 align:middle line:90%
as he's taking the cortisol.

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol causes your body to
activate the fat programs,

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
because it tricks you into
thinking you're in a famine.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a trigger.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So already you've got
some sort of stress

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that's activating your
fat programs, that

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
causes you to gain weight to the
point that you get sleep apnea.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing goes on
to-- it takes a new level.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Now your body really wants
to be fat, craving junk food,

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.280 align:middle line:90%
you're exhausted all the time.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a vicious,
vicious, vicious cycle.

01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
At my heaviest, I had the
worst case of sleep apnea

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that the sleep study
technicians, when

01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.640 align:middle line:90%
they studied me, had ever seen.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I used to-- and the way
you know-- one of the ways

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:04.057 align:middle line:84%
you know you have sleep
apnea is if you snore a lot,

01:08:04.057 --> 01:08:06.500 align:middle line:90%
and then you stop snoring.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And I used to snore
like nobody snored.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time
I was in a plane.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I was in the back of the plane,
and I must have fallen asleep.

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But all I know is
that I woke up,

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and I see as far forward as
you can see, every set of eyes.

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:24.229 align:middle line:90%
The entire plane is staring.

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Little kids, you
know, babies everyone.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- and I wake up
and I see all these eyes

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.557 align:middle line:90%
staring at me.

01:08:29.557 --> 01:08:31.890 align:middle line:84%
I just sort of pretend like
I don't know what's going on

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and I just kind of look away.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But the whole plane
could hear me snore.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first time
I went to visit Australia,

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping
outside at a farm.

01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:41.899 align:middle line:84%
And there was cows grazing
all through hundreds

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:42.890 align:middle line:90%
of acres of land.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:44.029 align:middle line:90%
And I was sleeping outside.

01:08:44.029 --> 01:08:46.279 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the
morning, I kid you

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
not, every single cow was
lined up along the fence just

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
staring at me like
I was giving out--

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.199 align:middle line:84%
like I was some sort of deity
waiting for their next command.

01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:58.763 align:middle line:90%


01:08:58.763 --> 01:09:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is you're
snoring all the time

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:01.763 align:middle line:90%
because you can't breathe.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:03.928 align:middle line:84%
And then you stop
snoring because you've

01:09:03.928 --> 01:09:04.970 align:middle line:90%
cut off your circulation.

01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:06.899 align:middle line:90%
Then you have this big snore.

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:07.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's an indication.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.939 align:middle line:84%
But you have to get
treated for sleep apnea.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember last
year I was talking

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.600 align:middle line:90%
to some guy in Melbourne.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.080 align:middle line:90%
His name's Alan Scotty Davidson.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.407 align:middle line:84%
He's on my internet
too, if you check.

01:09:18.407 --> 01:09:19.490 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to this guy.

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
The guy calls me, and he said,
I'm trying to lose weight.

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I need to lose about, I
don't remember what he said,

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:25.490 align:middle line:90%
50 kilos, whatever it was.

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:27.439 align:middle line:90%
And I'm tired all the time.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I eat this, I eat that.

01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:29.779 align:middle line:84%
But I could tell
from his breathing

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that he had sleep
apnea, because he was

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:32.143 align:middle line:90%
breathing the way I used to.

01:09:32.143 --> 01:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Like he sounded a bit like
Darth Vader on the phone.

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.783 align:middle line:90%
He'd go, hello.

01:09:35.783 --> 01:09:37.715 align:middle line:90%
[LOUD BREATHING]

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:40.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to lose weight.

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:43.649 align:middle line:90%
The force is with you.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Luke, I'm not your father, Luke.

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, he would
talk like this.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And I used to talk
like that on the phone.

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I had this big heavy breathing.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.995 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't want to
talk about what you're eating

01:09:53.995 --> 01:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
and what you're not eating.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, you've got sleep apnea.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
As long as you have sleep
apnea, get that taken care of,

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
and then we can have a
chat about the rest of it.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
He got the sleep
apnea taken care of.

01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:07.425 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do it is you
go to a sleep study clinic.

01:10:07.425 --> 01:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Jack can give you
information about how

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:11.258 align:middle line:84%
to take care of sleep apnea,
especially in Melbourne,

01:10:11.258 --> 01:10:13.010 align:middle line:90%
because he's from Melbourne.

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
You get a machine
called a CPAP machine

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that blows air into
your nose and mouth

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.545 align:middle line:90%
while you're sleeping.

01:10:18.545 --> 01:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It gives your
windpipe more pressure

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
to overcome the
weight of your neck.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.380 align:middle line:90%
And so he did this.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And he called me
two weeks later.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
He said he had lost
13 kilos in 13 days.

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:31.498 align:middle line:90%
Which is unheard of.

01:10:31.498 --> 01:10:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not recommending
that or suggesting

01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that that's what
happens all the time,

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.370 align:middle line:84%
but it did happen, because
that was his issue.

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And he went on to lose 40 kilos
over four months pretty much

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.360 align:middle line:90%
effortlessly.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And he's on the website.

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.253 align:middle line:90%
But that was his issue.

01:10:44.253 --> 01:10:46.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole point is you
have to nail the issue,

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.770 align:middle line:84%
whether it's from chronic
dieting, nutritional famine,

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:55.110 align:middle line:84%
toxins, artificial ingredients,
sleep apnea, dehydration.

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Drink lots of water.

01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, you have
to address the issue.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:01.380 align:middle line:84%
But more important than
any of these things

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
and in my experience,

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.880 align:middle line:84%
for 80% of all people that
have chronic weight issues,

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.370 align:middle line:84%
it's mental and
emotional stress.

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Because mental and emotional
stress causes chemistry

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that causes that
insulin resistance,

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:13.963 align:middle line:90%
that activates the fat programs.

01:11:13.963 --> 01:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's real, it's
tangible, it's chemical.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
being an emotional eater.

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a tangible, chemical
thing that has to be addressed.

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about it next session.

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:25.577 align:middle line:84%
And now we can take
a break, and now you

01:11:25.577 --> 01:11:27.825 align:middle line:84%
get to sample our
lovely cuisine.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see you
back here soon.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.460 align:middle line:90%


01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Today's seminar was
fantastic, actually.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of questions
raised that aren't addressed

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
in the book, so
it really helped,

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, I suppose cemented
a little bit more in my head

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.020 align:middle line:84%
in how to deal with
it moving forward,

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
like actually put the
principles in practice.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was
really, really good.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely love the book.

01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:57.137 align:middle line:84%
I had so many light bulb
moments when I was reading it.

01:11:57.137 --> 01:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I've tried nearly
everything over the years,

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:01.010 align:middle line:90%
so I thought it was fantastic.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Finally, after 30 years, I
have a normal relationship with

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:06.290 align:middle line:90%
food again.

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I can look at it and
say it's only food.

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:10.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't need it.

01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I am happier in my life, in my
thinking, in my relationship,

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
at my work, and
it's because of Jon.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.780 align:middle line:90%
The meditation that he does.

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me feel
much more happier.

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm spreading the
word to all my friends

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and say, come with me, come with
me, because I feel sensational.
