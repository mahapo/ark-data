00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> You have a good lunch?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.740 align:middle line:90%
You guys feel good?

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.431 align:middle line:84%
OK, we can start
taking some questions.

00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we've got
mics everywhere,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to raise
hands, and stand up, and do

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.958 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Jon.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's first?

00:00:39.843 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't really
have a question,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
but I do have a statement
I'd like to make.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there
is another option as well

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:90%
as the CPAP machine.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And my husband's had bad
sleep apnea for many years.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was put
onto a mouth guard

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
by a dental nurse who
said you can do that.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I--

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So that is another
option, and it works well.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it depends on the
type of sleep apnea you have.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't think a mouth
guard, for example,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
would've worked for me because
it was the weight of my neck

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and chest were just
collapsing my windpipe.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it had nothing
do with my mouth.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
But some people have like a--

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
have sleep apnea because
of phlegm or flesh

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
in their esophagus
and things like that.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on the type of
sleep apnea that you have.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not saying that it
was specifically for you.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But I just thought that
for the broader audience--

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --they might help to know
that there is another option

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:90%
here as well.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK, thanks.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the bottom line is
you do, definitely, you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
have to get the sleep
apnea addressed.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, really--
it's really crucial.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So whichever way you go,
you have to make sure

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:90%
that once it's in place--

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
even when you get
a CPAP machine,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
for example, sometimes,
like the first one I got,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:84%
it was blowing just
air into my nose.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't breathing
through my nose.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't doing
anything for me.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I had to get a special mask
that fit my nose and mouth

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and had to get the
pressure just right.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.128 align:middle line:84%
And you really have
to fool with it

00:02:03.128 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to make sure that it's right.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, hi, Jon.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask the
question about alcohol.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably a lot of
people wanted to ask it,

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:90%
but I thought I would.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So how detrimental is
that to our weight loss?

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, obviously
you're talking--

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm only talking small
amounts, like a red wine, or--

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, look.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look, this
is not a diet.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.707 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't-- you don't need
me to come up here and say,

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
don't drink, as if that's going
to do any good for anybody.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But what I have
found is that people

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:90%
drink for different reasons.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
People drink, smoke,
take drugs, sedatives

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:90%
for different reasons.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
One of them is to calm
down and relieve stress.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And what I find as a
byproduct from all of this

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.858 align:middle line:84%
is that people, once
they're listening to the CD

00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
deal with stress,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
naturally start craving
less alcohol, less--

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.620 align:middle line:90%
or quit smoking, or less drugs.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's an organic process.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So I always say to keep the
focus on adding the nutrients

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with the stress
aspects and detoxification

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
falls into place.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.700 align:middle line:90%
You require less medication.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
You need less sedatives, less
alcohol, less cigarettes,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So just keep the focus on adding
and not so much on restriction.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember,
this is forever.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
This is about getting your
body to want to be thin

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.202 align:middle line:90%
and solving the problem forever.

00:03:27.202 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about
being on a program

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> My question is regarding
the evening visualization CD.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You fall asleep
listening to it.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Beg your pardon.

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You can fall asleep
listening to the CD.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been listening
since June, July.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>> People tell me
that all the time,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that they listen
to it right away.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they hear
it, they fall asleep.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I have fantastic--

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a natural--
everybody's good at something.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.568 align:middle line:84%
That's a natural
talent I have is--

00:03:50.568 --> 00:03:51.368 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:03:51.368 --> 00:03:52.785 align:middle line:84%
>> --to put people
to sleep, so--

00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I sleep really well now.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I only listened like once.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:90%
I listened to the 23 minutes.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So my question is--

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody really
knows what the end is.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --does it still work?

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.322 align:middle line:90%
>> I could be saying anything.

00:04:04.322 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it still work
though, while I'm asleep?

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It totally works.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.985 align:middle line:84%
It works even better actually
without your conscious mind

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:90%
filtering it.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So no problem falling asleep.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.507 align:middle line:84%
>> But who knows what
I'm really saying?

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.729 align:middle line:90%
Come to a seminar.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just asking about--

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm one to go home.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll get the spirulina,
the whey powder, eat eggs.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Where do you find the balance
in between your vitamins,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.755 align:middle line:84%
and proteins, and things
that you are consuming?

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:35.555 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:04:35.555 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't understand the
que-- what do you mean,

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.892 align:middle line:84%
where do you find a balance
between the vitamins?

00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm going to
have my eggs, omega.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.535 align:middle line:90%
I'll have a spirulina.

00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll chuck a
multivitamin in steak.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Where do you start with the whey
powder and the wheatgrass shot?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do you stop with it?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do I start?

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, where do
you start with it?

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, do I need
all five things?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Or how do I--

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, again,
it's not a diet.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:90%
You're just taking principles.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
The principles are you want as
much live food as you can have.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:90%
You need a source of omega 3s.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And you need protein--

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.617 align:middle line:90%
so the principles.

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
How you apply those
principles is totally up

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to you, and your lifestyle,
and your-- and what's

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:90%
available to you.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So don't stay too focused on
what specifically you're doing.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.085 align:middle line:84%
But always ask yourself,
am applying the principles?

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Am I getting the
nutrients that I need?

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.573 align:middle line:84%
Those three nutrients,
am I getting those?

00:05:33.573 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Am I dealing with the
stress in my life?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Am I dealing with the emotional
abyss, or your sleep apnea,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%
or dehydration.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Stick with the
principles and concepts,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and then you can kind
of make it your own.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We've just got a question
for the vegetarians.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> You said there were
three essential things that

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
vegetarians need,
the protein, the--

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, vegetarians
need a source of protein.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
There's a good one called rice--

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.385 align:middle line:90%
a rice protein by Sunwarrior.

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So vegetarians need a
good source of protein.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
They need a good
source of B vitamins,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and a really good one
is nutritional yeast.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, and--

00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can get nutritional
yeast usually at a health food

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
The best company
is called Lotus.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really high-quality
type of brewer's yeast,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
has a really good
vitamin B. And the other

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
is fresh-squeezed
wheatgrass juice.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's got lots of
vitality and nutrients that you

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
need.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The risk with vege--
being a vegetarian

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is there's essential
nutrients that you're missing,

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:90%
and you stay hungry.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.028 align:middle line:84%
And when you're hungry, you
eat bread, and rice, and beans.

00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And you just keep eating
those, and eating those,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and eating those.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
satisfy that, and you

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:90%
stay nutritionally deficient.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Those three things,
protein, nutritional yeast,

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and fresh-squeezed wheatgrass
juice will give you everything

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:90%
you need to--

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that you would otherwise
get from meats.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thank you.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Jon.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Jack.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got three mums here--

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Three mums.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> --and we really just want
to know more about the skin,

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and the elasticity, and
what's the best food or source

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition you
can do, or take,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:84%
or even rub on your skin
to get that to go back.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, all I can say as
far as skin elasticity

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
is that my skin retained
a lot of elasticity

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:90%
in the weight-loss process.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was different
than what people--

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
the results that
people see when they're

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
losing weight through
crash dieting and surgery.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the reasons for that

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
is that when you try to lose
weight through restriction,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
dieting, surgery,
extreme methods,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.860 align:middle line:84%
it places an enormous
stress on your body.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And that stress elevates
your cortisol levels.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.782 align:middle line:84%
And cortisol causes your
skin to lose its elasticity.

00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
The way I lost weight is
a very low-stress way.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:90%
My cortisol levels were lowered.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Through all the detoxification,
through-- by adding

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
healthy, organic foods, and
foods that help detoxify you,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and superfoods,
my organs and skin

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
retained their
vitality through eating

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:90%
a lot of also live foods.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And your skin-- and also losing
it in a gradual way, your skin

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:84%
retains as much
elasticity as possible.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So just following the
approach, and reducing stress,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
having more real,
live foods will help

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
your skin keep its elasticity.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I have an
underactive thyroid.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, how would this go--

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
losing the weight
affect the thyroid?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the approach actually
might help you speed up--

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
help your thyroid
become more active.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that,
a lot of times, people

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
have an underactive thyroid
because of something

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:90%
called "leptin resistance."

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And leptin is the master hormone
that regulates body weight.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things it does
is it slows down your thyroid.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
tell me they have

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.858 align:middle line:84%
got an underactive thyroid,
but that's exactly what happens

00:08:50.858 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
when your fat
programs are activated

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:90%
is your thyroid slows down.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
By dealing with all of the
different things that turn off

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.120 align:middle line:84%
those fat programs,
your body becomes

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive to
this hormone, leptin,

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and then it sends a
signal from your brain

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:90%
to your thyroid to speed up.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And then your thyroid speeds up.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So that-- so just
following the approach

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
may actually help tremendously
to get the thyroid

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:90%
to be more normal.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've just had
to up my tablets through it

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
because I've just had
another attack with it.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, thank you.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got the CD for
the nighttime meditation

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and the one for the
morning meditation.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.328 align:middle line:84%
When would you integrate the
"Living Goddess" meditation CD?

00:09:34.328 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I just want to mention--
a couple of people have asked

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
me.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
That visualization that
we did this morning is

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:84%
very similar to the
morning visualization CD

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that I have out there, so if
you're interested in that.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And I do recommend that you
listen to that in the morning.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.057 align:middle line:84%
I have another CD, which
this lady is talking about,

00:09:49.057 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
called the "Living Goddess"
CD, which I made specifically

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
for women, especially mothers
who are giving, and giving,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%
and giving.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.625 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a mother,
you, by definition,

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:90%
you have a boundary issue.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got someone that
you've-- that's part of you,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:90%
that you've given birth.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
You can't say no
to them too easily.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
But so you're giving,
and giving, and giving.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.647 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
you're giving there.

00:10:12.647 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:90%
You're giving at work.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
You're giving with your
partner, with all--

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:90%
with your friends.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.190 align:middle line:84%
You're giving, and
giving, and giving.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you're giving
from your own natural--

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
or from your own resources,
you get depleted.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is your
body kind of uses weight

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to kind of protect you
from everyone that's

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:90%
wanting something from you.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.860 align:middle line:84%
It's another way to use
weight as a boundary

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
if your boundaries
aren't strong.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And the "Living Goddess"
meditation, what it does

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:90%
is rather than connect--

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
rather than have you give from
your own personal resource,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:84%
it connects you to just like
the source of all energy,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
like this ocean of
energy, and lets

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
it come through you
so that you're not

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.650 align:middle line:90%
draining your own resources.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
You just become a tap
for just universal energy

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:90%
to just flow through you.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
never, ever exhausted.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And then your body doesn't
need to use the weight

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:90%
as a form of-- as a boundary.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
powerful meditation.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
your question is,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
it would be really good if you
had a specific time of the day

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that you devoted
just to meditating,

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:84%
whether it's like 10 o'clock
in the afternoon, or 3 o'clock

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:90%
in the--

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.353 align:middle line:84%
or 10 o'clock in the
morning, rather, or 3 o'clock

00:11:22.353 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.138 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a lot of different
time zones right now.

00:11:25.138 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.137 align:middle line:84%
It's still 10 o'clock
in the afternoon for me.

00:11:28.137 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But a specific time during
the day or once a week,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:84%
but just something, whatever
it is, whether it's once a day,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.643 align:middle line:84%
whether it's once a
week, whether it's

00:11:36.643 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
three times, whatever is, it
has to be a pattern and a habit

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing all the time.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.525 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets
easier and easier.

00:11:43.525 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
happens automatically.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
You'll find if you meditate
every day at 4:00 o'clock

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon
for half an hour,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.198 align:middle line:84%
and you stop doing
it one day, you're

00:11:51.198 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
just going to feel
totally different.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.727 align:middle line:84%
Your body is going to
want you to sit down.

00:11:54.727 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
spacey, and you're

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
going to want to
have that meditation.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So doing it enough times
at the same time every day,

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
whatever that is,
will create a pattern

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
for where you're
just-- after that, you

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:90%
just-- it becomes automatic.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Like for me, I do a meditation--

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I do visualization
every morning.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
to think about it.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.525 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I want to sit.

00:12:14.525 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:90%
That's the one thing.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.705 align:middle line:84%
And as I sit, I go deeper,
and deeper, and deeper.

00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
All this information
comes to me.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:90%
All this energy comes to me.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm calmer.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I feel a sense of power
coming through me.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest
of the day, I just

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
let it happen the
way it happens.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Jon.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I've been following the
principles from the book

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and have noticed a definite
change in the way that I eat.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I need to eat sort of
shifted up earlier in the day.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But I have insulin resistance,
and amounts are a problem.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't always know-- sometimes
I'll know when I'm full,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes I know that I've
eaten more than I need to eat.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really have a
great signal on when's enough.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, you don't.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
fat programs are on,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:90%
you get insulin resistance.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.305 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:08.122 align:middle line:84%
But everything that
we're doing here,

00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
everything that
we're doing here is

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to address that insulin
resistance so that--

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and also what's accompanying
it is the leptin resistance so

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:84%
that your brain will start
listening to your stomach

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.538 align:middle line:84%
Right now, your brain's not
listening to your stomach

00:13:20.538 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:90%
right now when you're eating.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you're full, it's
not paying attention.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:25.708 align:middle line:90%
That will change.

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
All of these things,
all these things

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:90%
start to try to undo themselves.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Jon, hi, Jon.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.920 align:middle line:84%
With emotional
obesity, following

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
on from the other
lady's question,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.575 align:middle line:84%
there are issues that we
have from early childhood.

00:13:41.575 --> 00:13:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And often, the weight issue
may not manifest until much

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:90%
later in our life.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, do we need to be
focusing on that initial issue

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:90%
from our early childhood?

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Or would we be better
served by focusing

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
on the trigger
that actually comes

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:90%
to play in our later life?

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:04.833 align:middle line:90%
Or are they connected?

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer to
that question is,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:12.168 align:middle line:84%
if the emotional issue triggered
a weight gain initially,

00:14:12.168 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
in other words, if it did-- like
if you have something happen

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
when you were seven years old
and that's when you started

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
gaining weight, then, yes, you
have to go back and deal with

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
it if the trigger caused
the weight gain initially.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't or, rather, if
the issue caused weight gain

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
initially-- if it didn't
cause weight gain initially,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and you've got some sort of
trigger here that's reminding

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.475 align:middle line:84%
you of that, and your body is
using weight as a reaction,

00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:90%
then, no, you don't have to.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That trigger though, in
the present, for example,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.155 align:middle line:84%
may be the same thing
that happened back then.

00:14:40.155 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I understand the question, yeah.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.112 align:middle line:84%
>> But what I'm saying is, you
can deal with just the trigger

00:14:45.112 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:84%
right now unless originally
when it happened,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.088 align:middle line:90%
it caused you to gain weight.

00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:52.588 align:middle line:84%
If originally when it happened
it caused you to gain weight,

00:14:52.588 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:84%
then, yes, you've
got to go back to it.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:90%
You've got to reexamine it.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You've got to release
it on a cellular level

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:84%
through some sort
of healing modality.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yes.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that my problem
is emotional obesity.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
But I-- and I know it
started at a very early age,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know
what the trigger was.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to find
the trigger before you

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.327 align:middle line:90%
can deal with healing?

00:15:15.327 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Or is hypnotherapy useful?

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.035 align:middle line:84%
>> That's another--
that's definitely--

00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:84%
that's definitely a case
for a really gifted healer

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
because a really gifted healer
will be able to take you back

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and intuitively know what
happened and what to do about

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's a--

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you think
hypnotherapy is useful?

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think hypnotherapy
is useful in that case?

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But you have to deal with
the right hypnotherapist

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.280 align:middle line:90%
and the right healer.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I think the right
healer is more important

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:90%
than the right modality.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a question
of trial and error

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.490 align:middle line:84%
of finding people
that you've talked to.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:57.433 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the food or beverage
that made you gain the weight

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:90%
a couple of years ago?

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah, thank you.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.388 align:middle line:84%
I used to eat a lot
of pizza, actually.

00:16:04.388 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Pizza caused me to gain weight.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was more that
there was a need inside me

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.135 align:middle line:84%
to hold onto weight, I
think, and that would--

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and that caused me to eat
a lot of fattening foods.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely liked
pizza, no question about it.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I suffer from
polycystic ovaries.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a condition that makes
my hormones jump up and down.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And I tend to gain weight
during my period quite rapidly.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just wondering if
you've got any advice about

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:90%
that?

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I do, and I'm really
glad you mentioned that

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
because I want to put this up.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.598 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put someone else
on the screen who I mentioned

00:16:37.598 --> 00:16:39.520 align:middle line:90%
before, Dr. Howard Liebowitz.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.226 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.226 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And his radio show is called
"Hormones Spoken Here."

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually-- I'm a
regular on the show now.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.215 align:middle line:84%
I appear every once a month,
I think the first Tuesday

00:16:59.215 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of the month in
the States, which

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
is the first Wednesday
of the month.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
He's quite considered
the world authority

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
on natural hormone balancing.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And polycystic ovarian
syndrome is a really tricky one

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
because it does wreak
havoc on your hormones.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.397 align:middle line:84%
But he's got it-- in his show,
you can call and talk to him,

00:17:16.397 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:90%
and he'll answer your questions.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge gift because--

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- it would
be very difficult to get

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.498 align:middle line:90%
an appointment with this guy.

00:17:22.498 --> 00:17:25.610 align:middle line:84%
He's been-- you know Dr. Phil
from the "Dr. Phil Show?"

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.400 align:middle line:90%
He's Dr. Phil's doctor.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.015 align:middle line:84%
He's been on the "Dr.
Phil Show" a few times.

00:17:32.015 --> 00:17:34.630 align:middle line:84%
He deals with all kinds of
famous celebrities, so very

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:90%
tough to deal--

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:90%
to get an appointment.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
But you can call
in and talk to him.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And polycystic ovar-- things
like polycystic ovarian

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
syndrome and menopause are areas
that you want to talk to him

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:84%
about to get the best advice on
how to balance your hormones.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the stress
of the hormone--

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of your hormones going
all over the place

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:90%
is causing weight gain.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
ask also about rice

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and what you think about eating
rice and things like couscous,

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.298 align:middle line:90%
sort of more dense food.

00:18:00.298 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, what about them?

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.140 align:middle line:90%
What do you--

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Just if they're
not good to eat, or--

00:18:04.682 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, the question is
about rice and couscous,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.765 align:middle line:90%
if they're not good to eat.

00:18:07.765 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:84%
For me, the foods that I'm
attracted to these days

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
are foods that have one of
those essential ingredients.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.598 align:middle line:84%
Either they're live, they've got
omega 3s, or they're protein.

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
My body's been really
trained at this point

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that that's all
I'm interested in.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I need other things
like grains, and rice,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and bread, it just-- it
tastes like cardboard to me.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can eat it and
whenever you want.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But know that it's not
really doing anything other

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
than providing energy, but
you have energy already.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Your body just doesn't know
how to access that energy.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
So all it is is just
storing more energy.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So eat it, but always
add those ingredients

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about too
whenever you're eating it.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Add the couscous,
or add the rice

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.517 align:middle line:84%
to a salad with some
meat, chicken, fish.

00:18:52.517 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Find some-- put some
ground flaxseeds on it,

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.453 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:18:55.453 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.584 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:57.584 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Jon.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I follow your food program, and
I've lost like 30 centimeters

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
off my waist, which
is very exciting.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But I've sort of got stuck,
and my-- it was my personal

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.192 align:middle line:84%
trainer who said I needed
to get my thinking right.

00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:90%
So I've come to this seminar.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:90%
It's been really good.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.395 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just wondering, with
sort of heavyish weightlifting,

00:19:21.395 --> 00:19:22.195 align:middle line:90%
not--

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
well, yeah, as
heavy as I can do,

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that sort of has made a big
difference to my insulin

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.490 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But do you have an opinion about
whether that could possibly

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.405 align:middle line:84%
be a positive or negative
thing in my program.

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking about
exercise and weightlifting.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I'm glad you
brought that up too.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about exercise.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of people have
asked me about exercise.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, exercise, people
look at exercise in terms

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:90%
of the calories that you burn.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.242 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:49.242 --> 00:19:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at weight loss in terms

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of calories in,
calories out, then

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.770 align:middle line:84%
exercise is good because
it burns calories.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But I remember, like
when I lived in New York

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying to lose weight,
and I had fitness trainers,

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I used to go to the gym.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'd ride the stationary
bike for an hour.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And it said I would lose maybe
like 1,000 kilojoules, or 300

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:90%
calories.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'd think to myself, 300
calories, that's like a bagel.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.815 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I just
not eat the bagel?

00:20:17.815 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's really, you know, like
to exercise for a whole hour,

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.812 align:middle line:84%
and so I used to get
discouraged by that.

00:20:23.812 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
it from its calories

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
in, calories out perspective,
it is kind of discouraging.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But exercise, it can
also be used as a tool

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
to get your body
to want to be thin.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's different
than burning calories.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you use
exercise as a tool

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
to get your body
to want to be thin,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes
extremely effective,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to do
it that long or that often

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:90%
in order to do it.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember I said before--

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:90%
What's so funny?

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember I said
before that you've

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
got that "get thin, or
get eaten" adaptation?

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at your
body's set point-- like right

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
now, if your body's
set point is 80

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and you think you're
being chased by a tiger,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
your set point
quickly goes down.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get-- use exercise
as a tool to trick you that you

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:17.928 align:middle line:90%
think--

00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:19.970 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that you're
being chased by a tiger

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.782 align:middle line:84%
or into activating this "get
thin, or get eaten" adaptation,

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
then you've shifted
your set point.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got your body
to want to be thin rather

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:90%
than just burn calories.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the way I
discovered this was about 3/4

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:90%
into my weight loss process.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was
biking up a hill.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, I
really need something

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:90%
to give my weight loss a boost.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.085 align:middle line:84%
And the second I thought that,
this dog comes out of nowhere

00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and started chasing
me from a driveway,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:90%
sort of [MIMICS DOG SNARLING]

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's like this far away from
taking out my Achilles tendon

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:90%
for a kilometer.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And I stand up.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sprinting, and I'm
sprinting, and I'm sprinting.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:53.855 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking back.

00:21:53.855 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:90%
And he's going [SNARLS].

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Finally, he gives up.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was just relieved
and all that stuff.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The next couple of weeks,
my weight just like just

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.483 align:middle line:84%
plummeted, like weight just was
dropping off me left and right.

00:22:07.483 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't hungry, and
I couldn't figure out

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
what it was.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
I made the connection

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:90%
about this dog chasing me.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And then so after that,
whenever I was biking

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and I got to that
point, I'd stand up,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'd imagine that
the dog was chasing me.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Because your mind doesn't know.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.627 align:middle line:84%
The brain-- the
part of your brain

00:22:29.627 --> 00:22:34.132 align:middle line:84%
that's in charge of
how fat or thin you are

00:22:34.132 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know the
difference between

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:90%
a real and imagined experience.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
What happens in your brain
is if this is your head

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is your
neck here, this is

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
your-- this is the
part of your brain

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that's in charge of how
fat or thin you are.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.098 align:middle line:84%
And your eyes are here, and
your visual cortex is here.

00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So it takes in the
information through your eyes,

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and then it sends it down to
this part of you and says,

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.490 align:middle line:90%
you're being chased by a tiger.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
do a visualization

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and send that same
information down there,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't know where
it's coming from,

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.505 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't know
if it's real or not.

00:23:06.505 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like that
movie "War Games."

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.297 align:middle line:84%
You ever see the
movie "War Games"

00:23:09.297 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:84%
years ago with
Matthew Broderick?

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
In the first scene
in that movie,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:84%
there were these two men at
the bottom of a nuclear silo

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
300 feet down.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And they were in
charge of pressing

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.560 align:middle line:90%
a button for a nuclear war.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:90%
That was their job.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And they would get the
call, press the button.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
know if it was real,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.332 align:middle line:84%
if it was a real World War III
or if it was just an exercise.

00:23:30.332 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:84%
All they knew was they
had to press the button.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
If the world was going
to end, they didn't know.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.212 align:middle line:90%
They just got the signal.

00:23:36.212 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same with
this part of your brain.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.087 align:middle line:90%
It just gets a signal.

00:23:39.087 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know where
the signal's coming from.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So when you do a visualization,
visualize anything,

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
your body thinks
it's actually real.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And they've done experiments
with Olympic athletes where

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.610 align:middle line:84%
they visualize
their ideal sport,

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
muscles and nerves

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.210 align:middle line:84%
get fired in the
exact same sequence

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.808 align:middle line:84%
as if they're really
doing the sport.

00:23:57.808 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So I would get to
that certain point.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I'd stand up, and I'd sprint.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'd imagine I was
being chased by this dog.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, I got kind of lazy.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.723 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- before
I was going to sleep,

00:24:08.723 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I'd just imagine that
I was being chased

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
by like a tiger or
something like that, like I

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:90%
was in really good shape.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.047 align:middle line:90%
I was running as fast I can.

00:24:14.047 --> 00:24:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm being chased by a tiger.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd just do the visualization.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Because your body doesn't know
the difference between a real

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and imagined experience.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So what you can
do with exercise--

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:84%
like if you were
going for a walk,

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going for
a 20-minute walk.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't just do this power
walk where you're just

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:84%
bang, bang, bang, bang,
bang for 20 minutes doing

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:90%
this cardio-pump thing.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Walk leisurely.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But then every once in a while,
just for 10 or 20 seconds,

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
move as fast as you can, and
I mean as fast as you can.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And imagine you're being
chased by a predator.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Get your doctor's approval
for this, obviously.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.735 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:52.735 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't want any
deaths on my hands.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but--

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.407 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but let me
finish what I'm doing.

00:25:01.407 --> 00:25:02.207 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:02.207 --> 00:25:03.190 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back to it.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But stand up and move
as fast as you can.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, and imagine you're
being chased by a predator.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were walking
in the woods and a bear

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:84%
started chasing
you, you wouldn't

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.490 align:middle line:90%
go for a 40-minute cardio walk.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.582 align:middle line:84%
You'd go for 10
seconds, life or death.

00:25:23.582 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:90%
That's what you would go for.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And they've done studies.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They did a study with
women where one of them

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:84%
was exercising every
single day for 40

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
minutes on a stationary
bike, just spinning.

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.013 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was
exercising three times

00:25:35.013 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:84%
a week for 20 minutes but
sprinting for 11 seconds

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.180 align:middle line:90%
periodically.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.620 align:middle line:84%
That group lost three
times as much weight.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
burn as much calories,

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
shift your set points.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And once you shift your set
point, everything else happens.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So don't focus so much
calories in, calories out.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Focus on, how am I
shifting my set points?

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And then it all comes together.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other thing
is, when you're

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
doing that type of intensity,
and if you look at-- also,

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
Olympic sprinters,

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
they've got less body fat on
them than marathon runners.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Not that marathon
runners are fat,

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
but Olympic sprinters look
like an anatomy class.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:90%
They've got zero fat.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And why should that be if you're
just sprinting 10 minutes--

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:84%
10 seconds every once in a while
as opposed to a marathon runner

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.680 align:middle line:90%
who's running 20Ks every day?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
The difference is, their body
thinks they have to be thin,

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:90%
or they're dead.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.783 align:middle line:84%
Because that sprint
is activating

00:26:29.783 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
the "get thin, or get
eaten" adaptation.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But you don't want to do
it too much because you

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.930 align:middle line:90%
need the intensity.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
If you do it everyday,
you will overtrain.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Overtraining elevates
your cortisol levels.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:90%
That actually makes you fatter.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.175 align:middle line:84%
That makes your body want--
that shifts your set point back.

00:26:46.175 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:90%
And they have done studies.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They did studies with
cross-country skiers

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
in Colorado at the
University of Colorado

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
where the more exercise they
did, the more weight they lost.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.878 align:middle line:84%
But it got to a certain point
where they did so much exercise

00:26:58.878 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that they overtrained, and
they started gaining weight.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So you want to do it a couple
times a week, three times,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.950 align:middle line:90%
four times max.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Have rest days.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But on those days,
hit it really hard.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as weight training
goes, do it on the same days

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
any other exercise,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:90%
so you still have rest days.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And weight training can
be really, really useful

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.460 align:middle line:84%
for helping your muscles become
more sensitive to insulin.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Because what it does, any
type of intensity exercise,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like a sponge.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It rings your muscles
out of stored sugar.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.477 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're done, your
muscles want to suck sugar up.

00:27:32.477 --> 00:27:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And when your muscles
want to suck sugar up,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.483 align:middle line:84%
they become very
sensitive to insulin.

00:27:37.483 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it actually helps
increase insulin resistan--

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:90%
insulin sensitivity.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But do it at the
same time as you're

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
doing any other exercise,
and have rest days.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Jon, hi, Jon.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I start work at 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give me some advice
as to how to do this with that

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.930 align:middle line:90%
odd sort of--

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> With what?

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> --sleeping and
eating pattern?

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, do you start
work every day to 2:00

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:90%
o'clock in the morning?

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, all right,
you just have to have--

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and this is a good way to
kind of tie into a day.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's just look at a day.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.106 align:middle line:84%
If you take a day,
beginning of the day,

00:28:15.106 --> 00:28:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and this is the end of the day.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it 100 units.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.485 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain point,
whatever, whether it's

00:28:21.485 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:84%
2:30 in the morning or whatever,
at a cert-- when you wake up,

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
you want to have some
water and probiotics.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:84%
You want to do some
sort of visualization.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a really good
breakfast within like, say,

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:49.398 align:middle line:84%
an hour of when you wake
up, hour and a half,

00:28:49.398 --> 00:28:51.065 align:middle line:84%
and then lunch,
whenever you have lunch.

00:28:51.065 --> 00:28:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.940 align:middle line:84%
You want to have a snack at
the equivalent of two hours

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:90%
after lu--

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:84%
two hours after lunch, a
snack, very similar to whatever

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:84%
it is that you've
been eating, and then

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
dinner just at two hours,
two or three hours later,

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:84%
two to three hours
later, dinner.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And drink a lot of
water at night--

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you're just looking
from a food perspective

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
to getting your
blood sugar stable,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.890 align:middle line:84%
eating most your
foods during the day.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:29.307 align:middle line:84%
So whatever time
you're waking up,

00:29:29.307 --> 00:29:31.557 align:middle line:84%
whether it's 2:00 in the
morning, 4:00 in the morning,

00:29:31.557 --> 00:29:33.020 align:middle line:84%
6:00 in the morning,
you just want

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
to have the same
basic principles.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you're waking up
at 2:30 in the morning,

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.423 align:middle line:84%
but if you can do some
visualization at 3:00

00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, and then
have breakfast at 4:00,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.220 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera, but keep--

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.960 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want to go
too long in the morning

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:90%
without eating.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.730 align:middle line:90%
That's really crucial.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Jon.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> My question is about
rheumatoid arthritis.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What success has the
Gabriel method had on that?

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot, and especially
because of the omega 3s over

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:90%
a six-month period.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Omega 3s are a natural
anti-inflammatory.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And from eating more live foods
that help detoxify the joints,

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
we've had enormous
success with that.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering,
from your experience,

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.280 align:middle line:84%
if you can comment
on sudden trauma,

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and how you keep maintaining
when something really traumatic

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
happens, and your default
is to go back to old habits.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Are you able to
comment a bit on that?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> "Old habits"
meaning habits from--

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Before you start even
reading up on the Gabriel method

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and things like it, does it come
naturally after a little while?

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So then sudden trauma or
anything really drastic

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you kind of keep
the maintenance up?

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd find
with sudden trauma

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.700 align:middle line:84%
sometimes that meditation
or anything like that

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.000 align:middle line:84%
is really difficult,
and you go back to what

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.720 align:middle line:90%
you default to knowing to do.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, that is true.

00:30:58.887 --> 00:31:00.262 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a
state of trauma,

00:31:00.262 --> 00:31:01.340 align:middle line:90%
you just want to retreat.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I made--
the CDs are easy.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.785 align:middle line:90%
They're very passive.

00:31:04.785 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:84%
You just have to listen to
them as you're going to sleep.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to kind
of like force yourself.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an automatic thing.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.550 align:middle line:84%
You can concentrate
or not concentrate.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So I would start
with that, yeah.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I just want to ask about,
a lot of my family's

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:90%
overweight on both sides.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
about hereditary or genes?

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Or has that got
anything to do with it.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing about genetics
is genetics will determine how

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.800 align:middle line:84%
predisposed you are to
activating the fat programs.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And what also happens is,
when a woman is pregnant,

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
they will communicate to--

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
a lady will communicate to
the fetus what type of world

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:90%
you're being born into.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Are you being born
into a world of famines

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:84%
where you need the
fat programs or tigers

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.890 align:middle line:90%
where you need to be thin?

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
That information will be
communicated to the fetus

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:84%
so that they will be
predisposed toward activating

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:90%
the fat programs or not.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:84%
One study in England over
40,000 people over years

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.348 align:middle line:84%
was that women who give
birth during winter time,

00:32:03.348 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
the children are much more
likely to have insulin

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:90%
resistance when they grow up.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.205 align:middle line:84%
And that's because that
information that it's-- that

00:32:10.205 --> 00:32:13.610 align:middle line:84%
you're growing up in a cold
world is being communicated

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to the fetus, so they're more
predisposed to activating

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
the programs that cause insulin
resistance in the fat programs.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's all it is is
it's a predisposition.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.400 align:middle line:84%
It makes it a quicker
trigger, but it's a trigger

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.730 align:middle line:90%
to activating certain genes.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can still do work
to activating other genes.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
You just have to understand
what's turning the genes on

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.110 align:middle line:90%
and what's turning them off.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry in advance.

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.496 align:middle line:90%
I've lost my voice.

00:32:37.496 --> 00:32:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But what if you're born bigger,
and you've done everything

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.540 align:middle line:90%
that you can do?

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't-- yeah.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I've never
had McDonald's, KFC,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.080 align:middle line:90%
or Hungry Jack's.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, I don't eat junk food.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.450 align:middle line:90%
I watch what I eat.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Carbs I have in moderation.

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat after 4 o'clock.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:90%
I do exercise.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.083 align:middle line:90%
I've got heavily into Zumba.

00:32:58.083 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're running
around like an idiot,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:90%
but I don't care.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't hear the last part.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I do Zumba.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.922 align:middle line:84%
Zumba, it's like
the new dance craze.

00:33:06.922 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I run around like an idiot.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I sweat like a pig.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but everything you're
telling me is about diet

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and exercise.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> But it, like--

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, am I right?

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.002 align:middle line:84%
>> --even though I do it,
I still have a mindset.

00:33:17.002 --> 00:33:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not like I hate myself.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:90%
I accept how I am.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a negative feeling.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Is this-- is it like something
that I've been born with?

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not like
it's been created

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:90%
from a trigger or anything.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much, but
everything you're telling me

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.730 align:middle line:84%
is in terms of
diet and exercise.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.130 align:middle line:84%
If I was talking
to you, I'd want

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
to know a lot more about
you, about what your life is,

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.025 align:middle line:84%
what the stresses are, when you
first started gaining weight.

00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe you're like born--

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.300 align:middle line:90%
born fat.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Born-- maybe that's
true, and maybe it isn't.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But what I was going to say
is, part of this seminar

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:84%
includes a phone
consultation with me.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can call my
office, speak to Jenny,

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.417 align:middle line:84%
and set up a time
for us to talk.

00:34:01.417 --> 00:34:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go-- we'll try
to personalize it, and go

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:84%
through your issues, and
see what works for you.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:84%
My question is about
autoimmune disorders.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So would your method
help that as well?

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:15.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, actually it can.

00:34:15.872 --> 00:34:17.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
about it, yeah.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:34:19.835 --> 00:34:20.703 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to-- is--

00:34:20.703 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make-- show you
how we made this milkshake.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys like that
milkshake, by the way?

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [MURMURING]

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.061 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, that milkshake-- there
was a no there, all right,

00:34:28.061 --> 00:34:29.780 align:middle line:90%
but anyway, a lot of yeses.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
That milkshake basically is
protein powder, organic cocoa

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.004 align:middle line:90%
powder, chia seeds.

00:34:36.004 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's got flaxseeds,
or chia seeds,

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:41.612 align:middle line:90%
or omega 3s, and some xylitol.

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
It'll keep your
blood sugar stable.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.139 align:middle line:84%
It'll nouri--
it'll energize you.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:84%
It'll nourish you with
omega 3s and protein.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And to me, it tastes great.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll just show you how to make--

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:84%
if I can get Abby
to come up here,

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:84%
she's going to help
me make it, if you

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.439 align:middle line:90%
want to give Abby a hand.

00:34:54.439 --> 00:34:55.419 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:55.419 --> 00:34:56.399 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:34:56.399 --> 00:35:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:04.520 align:middle line:90%
You can help me.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Can you help, Abby?

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Abby's my good friend here.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:90%
We've been talking all day.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do is we
put some milk in the blender.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.880 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it?

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Put it up to about here.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Here?

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:25.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:35:25.545 --> 00:35:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Pour.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you when.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And put a banana and just
some of that concoction

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.600 align:middle line:90%
that we made.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's good.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.115 align:middle line:90%
>> I never know how--

00:35:53.115 --> 00:35:54.893 align:middle line:90%
I don't look at--

00:35:54.893 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:84%
it says how much
to put in though.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It looks about right.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, how we doing now?

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.780 align:middle line:90%
Just give that a--

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:90%
go ahead.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Put that on.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:90%
No, try that one.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:06.894 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:36:06.894 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Ha, ha.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming out, is it?

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:84%
All right, and
that should be it.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:22.612 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
useful also for kids.

00:36:22.612 --> 00:36:24.654 align:middle line:84%
Let me just make sure
it's good enough for you.

00:36:24.654 --> 00:36:26.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.210 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> All right?

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Anybody didn't get?

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.872 align:middle line:90%
Anybody want any more?

00:36:36.872 --> 00:36:37.814 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:36:37.814 --> 00:36:38.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, does that have seeds--

00:36:38.756 --> 00:36:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you want some more?

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that?

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that have seeds in it?

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.308 align:middle line:90%
>> It's got chia seeds in it.

00:36:44.308 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Then how often can you
have it during the day?

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> How often can you
have it during the day?

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.465 align:middle line:84%
You can have it once
or twice, I guess.

00:36:49.465 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a good one to
have in the morning.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:52.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it a meal replacement?

00:36:52.943 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be a meal
because it's got proteins.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.000 align:middle line:90%
It's got omega 3s.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.652 align:middle line:90%
It's got some live food in it.

00:36:57.652 --> 00:36:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's got pretty much
everything you need.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.285 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.285 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
have to be a meal.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- it's an alternative.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a way to get--

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:06.770 align:middle line:90%
it tastes good too.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.560 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.856 align:middle line:84%
>> i think 3 o'clock
the afternoon is--

00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> 3 o'clock in the
afternoon is perfect.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:14.930 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it any good?

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Are you happy with it?

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really good.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Can you give Abby
a hand, please?

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:90%
You can take your seat now.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.200 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk later,
OK, sweetheart?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.713 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:37:29.713 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Can it be made so that
kids can take it to school?

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, can it be made
for kids to take to school?

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.426 align:middle line:90%
That was hers.

00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:37.617 align:middle line:90%
>> I let her have a sip--

00:37:37.617 --> 00:37:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you're sweet.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.280 align:middle line:90%
No, I know.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm just teasing.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.985 align:middle line:84%
But, all right, and I just want
to talk a little bit about kids

00:37:44.985 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:90%
if we can.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:49.688 align:middle line:84%
And with kids, it's
really a couple

00:37:49.688 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:90%
of things are really important.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.250 align:middle line:84%
One is the blood
sugar component.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Because all kids that
suffer from weight

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.040 align:middle line:84%
issues have elevated
insulin levels

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.088 align:middle line:84%
and can't keep their
blood sugar stable.

00:38:02.088 --> 00:38:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So with kids, you
really, really have

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.052 align:middle line:84%
to be proactive with
their blood sugar, which

00:38:07.052 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:84%
means that you have to know
before they do that their blood

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.250 align:middle line:90%
sugar is going to go down.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:84%
They have to have a
really good breakfast.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, kids, they don't want
to have a good breakfast.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:15.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
eat healthy foods.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
putting together

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.540 align:middle line:84%
all types of different
foods that we

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.360 align:middle line:84%
call "super delicious,
super nutritious"

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that tastes just as
good as any other food,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's got really
healthy ingredients.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So we've got
brownies, ice creams,

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.430 align:middle line:84%
chocolate milkshakes all
made from protein powder.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:84%
If there's sweetener,
it's xylitol.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They've got some
sort of omega 3s.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
They've got some
live food in them.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:44.492 align:middle line:84%
They're not overly
burdened with starchy carbs

00:38:44.492 --> 00:38:46.200 align:middle line:84%
that send your blood
sugar through-- they

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:90%
keep your blood sugar stable.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:49.570 align:middle line:90%
They nourish your body.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And so a shake like this, if a
kid's in a hurry and he doesn't

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.270 align:middle line:84%
want to-- he or she doesn't
want to have breakfast,

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.170 align:middle line:84%
and they say, all right, well,
just have a quick milkshake,

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.540 align:middle line:90%
they'll have that.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:58.957 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they
get home, they can

00:38:58.957 --> 00:39:00.420 align:middle line:90%
have a milkshake like that--

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:90%
but being really proactive.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you-- you have
to know, for example, when

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.630 align:middle line:84%
a kid gets home from
school, their blood sugar

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.110 align:middle line:90%
is going to be way down.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what type of food
choices they made for lunch.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't know that they ate
what you packed for them.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to schools,
they've got all kinds of--

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.650 align:middle line:90%
they've got soda machines.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.937 align:middle line:90%
They've got candy machines.

00:39:20.937 --> 00:39:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know what
type of food choices

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:23.790 align:middle line:90%
your kids are making.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.248 align:middle line:84%
And usually, by
the end of the day,

00:39:25.248 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:90%
their blood sugar is plummeting.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make
sure you've given them

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.320 align:middle line:90%
a really good breakfast.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the second
they walk through the door,

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:84%
the second you pick
them up, you want

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you're giving
them something healthy that

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.020 align:middle line:90%
keeps their blood sugar stable.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:90%
And I've got a--

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.013 align:middle line:90%
we can check the--

00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we have it
up on the website just yet.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.653 align:middle line:84%
But you can maybe email
Jenny, and then check soon.

00:39:44.653 --> 00:39:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We've got a really
good-- like chocolate

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.032 align:middle line:84%
brownie, chocolate mousse, ice
cream recipes, cake recipes,

00:39:50.032 --> 00:39:51.990 align:middle line:84%
all things that kids
would eat and really think

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that they were kind
of junk food but have

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:90%
healthy ingredients to them.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Also with kids, you-- like
when you're serving a meal,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.310 align:middle line:84%
you always want to at least
have a salad there and have

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:05.940 align:middle line:84%
some sort of fruit there, not
necessarily push it on them,

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.440 align:middle line:84%
but get them in the
habit of knowing

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.900 align:middle line:90%
that every meal's got a salad.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.983 align:middle line:84%
Every meal, you've
got sprinkles.

00:40:11.983 --> 00:40:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I've got friends
who've got little kids.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:90%
They put sprinkles.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And sprinkles are
the ground flaxseeds.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.638 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't serve
a salad at dinner,

00:40:17.638 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, mommy,
where's my salad?

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So just have that as alt-- as
there for them all the time,

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.430 align:middle line:84%
so every meals has a salad,
has ground flaxseeds.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:27.750 align:middle line:90%
There's fruit everywhere.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Fruit is always available.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:32.340 align:middle line:90%
But don't turn it into diet.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.830 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of discipline
and a lot of patience

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.570 align:middle line:90%
to deal with childhood obesity.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you can force
a kid to lose weight

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.680 align:middle line:84%
by dieting, by sending him to
fat camps like we did when I--

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.268 align:middle line:84%
like we went to
when I was younger,

00:40:44.268 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:84%
or putting locks on
the refrigerator,

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.102 align:middle line:90%
or all of these type of things.

00:40:47.102 --> 00:40:48.630 align:middle line:84%
You can force a
kid to lose weight.

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But every pound that
you take away from them

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:84%
is a pound that they're
going to be fighting

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.480 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of their life
because of mental and emotional

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.518 align:middle line:90%
issues and trauma.

00:40:55.518 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you
how many people I've

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.872 align:middle line:84%
talked to, how many thousands
of people I've talked to that

00:41:00.872 --> 00:41:03.330 align:middle line:84%
says, well, my mother used to
put me on every kind of diet.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have a weight
problem, but she was on a diet.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.425 align:middle line:84%
My mother put me on
every kind of diet.

00:41:06.425 --> 00:41:09.535 align:middle line:84%
So you're kind of--
you're not-- you're

00:41:09.535 --> 00:41:11.910 align:middle line:84%
sending a couple of messages--
one, that they're not good

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.957 align:middle line:84%
enough the way they are, that
you don't love them the way

00:41:14.957 --> 00:41:16.290 align:middle line:90%
they are, even if it's not true.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's not true.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.303 align:middle line:84%
These are the messages
that they're getting.

00:41:19.303 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have to really be
kind of a little bit covert

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.940 align:middle line:84%
about the issue, and
really, really patient,

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and understand that the
problem is they can't regulate

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:90%
their blood sugar right now.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:90%
There's some sort of stress.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.480 align:middle line:90%
It could be also toxins.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at when kids today--

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I heard that in the
States, for example,

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.020 align:middle line:84%
by the time they're
three years old,

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:84%
they've had something like
70 different vaccinations.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, vaccinations
may or may not be essential.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get
into that argument,

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:51.180 align:middle line:90%
but they do have toxins.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.710 align:middle line:90%
They've got mercury.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:90%
They've got formaldehyde.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:84%
They've got all types
of different bacterias

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that are cultivated in organs
of dogs, and monkeys, and pigs.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're giving them
one after the other

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
after the other of these
in the name of health.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it's the right thing.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's not.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:90%
But I do know there's toxins.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:14.615 align:middle line:84%
So you have to understand
why a kid's overweight.

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:16.740 align:middle line:84%
He's overweight because
he's bombarded with toxins.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.990 align:middle line:84%
He's overweight because of
the stresses in his life

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.570 align:middle line:84%
are so much bigger than the
stresses that we used to have,

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:24.960 align:middle line:84%
whether it's academic stress
or whether it's peer pressures.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.708 align:middle line:84%
They're being
bombarded with media

00:42:26.708 --> 00:42:28.500 align:middle line:84%
that's causing them
stress and telling them

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.730 align:middle line:90%
they're not good enough.

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's toxins that are
causing them to gain weight.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:84%
There's stress that are
causing them to gain weight.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The food that they're eating is
nutritionally barren, much more

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.530 align:middle line:90%
so than when we were kids.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in that but
just empty, dead carbohydrates

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.625 align:middle line:90%
and saturated fats.

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:45.282 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.282 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
They can't regulate their
blood sugar properly.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:84%
The arti-- there's
MSG in everything,

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.170 align:middle line:84%
activating their fat
programs, diet soda that's

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.530 align:middle line:90%
activating their fat programs.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.905 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things are
activating their fat programs,

00:42:58.905 --> 00:43:01.192 align:middle line:84%
so you can't look at a kid
with the standard paradigm

00:43:01.192 --> 00:43:02.400 align:middle line:90%
of calories in, calories out.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.380 align:middle line:84%
You've got to understand
what's going on

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and then be really,
really patient

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.300 align:middle line:90%
in how you're dealing with it.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So how do you deal with it?

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.417 align:middle line:84%
You've got to find some way
to deal with the stress.

00:43:10.417 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process of making
a visualization CD for kids

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.910 align:middle line:90%
that they can listen to.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.950 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, if
they're over nine years old,

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.450 align:middle line:84%
they can listen to
the visualization

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.460 align:middle line:84%
CD that we have already,
the evening one,

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.410 align:middle line:90%
or just the smart mode music.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.582 align:middle line:84%
When you play it at night
while they're studying,

00:43:24.582 --> 00:43:26.040 align:middle line:84%
or at dinnertime,
or just at night,

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.797 align:middle line:84%
it's just the
music that puts you

00:43:27.797 --> 00:43:29.130 align:middle line:90%
in a less stressful environment.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just background
music, the same background

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.870 align:middle line:84%
music that you were just
listening to in the last CD--

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:37.590 align:middle line:84%
so playing that type of music,
getting out and just going out

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:84%
for walks, but doing
stress reduction,

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
learning how to include foods
that detoxify, foods that

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:84%
are very high alkaline
like fresh juices

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and wheatgrass juice if
you'll have it, live food.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But always have the foods that
their body is starving for,

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:84%
the live foods, the omega 3s,
and the protein in every meal.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get
it in in healthy ways,

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to do it
in sneaky ways.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Use xylitol as a
sweetener for cakes,

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.040 align:middle line:90%
cookies, all these things.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Use protein powder in
part of the batter instead

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:90%
of some of the grains.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Use organic spelt instead
of whe-- instead of flour.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And then mix it
with protein powder.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Put ground flaxseeds on
or linseeds on everything.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.330 align:middle line:84%
There's chewable
fish oil capsules

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that they can take to
take their ground--

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to take their fish
oils, their omega 3s.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Put sprinkles on every meal.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.440 align:middle line:90%
So every meal's got salads.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It's got sprinkles of ground
flaxseeds at every single meal,

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's got fruit
at every single meal.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And if they want dessert,
they can have dessert,

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.720 align:middle line:84%
but only after they've
eaten their proper food.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.830 align:middle line:90%
But what's the dessert?

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a Gabriel
method dessert that's

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.358 align:middle line:84%
probably healthier than
anything else they're eating.

00:44:47.358 --> 00:44:49.403 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:50.570 align:middle line:90%
They can have the milkshake.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:51.280 align:middle line:90%
They can have the brownie.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.697 align:middle line:84%
They can have the
chocolate mousse

00:44:52.697 --> 00:44:54.418 align:middle line:84%
only if they ate
the good things.

00:44:54.418 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But no matter how you slice
it, they're getting things.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.293 align:middle line:84%
They're nourishing
their body, keeping

00:44:58.293 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:90%
their blood sugar stable.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And watch as they become
more attentive and more alert

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:84%
because omega 3s are going
to keep them much more

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.807 align:middle line:90%
attentive and much more alert.

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Watch how they're cra--
how they have more energy,

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
how their cravings change.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
is a positive momentum

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:90%
develops in their life.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.173 align:middle line:84%
When they see that they can
have control over the issue,

00:45:19.173 --> 00:45:22.053 align:middle line:84%
that it's not just this horrible
issue that's plaguing them,

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's no
solution, but they

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:27.212 align:middle line:84%
have control over the issue,
they want to learn more then.

00:45:27.212 --> 00:45:29.170 align:middle line:84%
When they see things are
happening, they want--

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:30.730 align:middle line:84%
they're going to start coming
to you and saying, mommy,

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.230 align:middle line:90%
what else do I do?

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:84%
That's when you
really can create

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:84%
a great partnership
between you and your kid

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.417 align:middle line:90%
to get them to work with you.

00:45:37.417 --> 00:45:39.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when you can
take them out for walks,

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and take them out for bike
rides, and help them--

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.680 align:middle line:84%
get them to help you
make healthy foods,

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and instruct them
on what's healthy.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get
that personal mo--

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that positive
momentum in their life

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that's created by having
some success in dealing

00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:01.080 align:middle line:84%
with the real issues, and
giving them more energy,

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.260 align:middle line:84%
and developing their
personal-- their self-esteem

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and their personal power,
then they'll run with it.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.315 align:middle line:84%
Once they have the tools that
they need to solve the problem

00:46:12.315 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and they see that they
can solve the problem,

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.107 align:middle line:90%
they will run with it.

00:46:15.107 --> 00:46:18.157 align:middle line:90%


00:46:18.157 --> 00:46:19.740 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be
done by understanding

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.740 align:middle line:84%
the principles of what
causes you to gain weight

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.167 align:middle line:84%
rather than dealing with
the standard, old paradigm

00:46:24.167 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that we all know that
doesn't work of calories in,

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:90%
calories out.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:32.610 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'll take a couple
more questions.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I just wanted to ask
about the visualization CDs.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Are they available in
MP3 format to download?

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, they are.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.233 align:middle line:90%
But you have to email my office.

00:46:45.233 --> 00:46:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Email jenny@gabrielmethod.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.512 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.512 --> 00:46:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, Jon, I just wanted to
tell you about what happened

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.560 align:middle line:90%
with my daughter.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I read "The Gabriel
Method" last year-- never

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.130 align:middle line:90%
did anything about it.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And basically, she
was very overweight.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.870 align:middle line:84%
She was probably 15 in a
size 20 women's clothing.

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Came December, she
decided she was

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.450 align:middle line:90%
going to do something about it.

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So all I did was fill the
house with as much fruit

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.300 align:middle line:90%
as I could and vegetables.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.490 align:middle line:84%
She started to walk on
a treadmill every day

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.945 align:middle line:90%
even when it was 44 degrees.

00:47:18.945 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> She added xylitol to her diet
because I told her how good it

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:90%
was for her.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So every sweetener she
put in it was xylitol.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Every night for dinner, she
would have the biggest salad

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:35.562 align:middle line:84%
she could have with chicken, or
meat, or whatever was in there.

00:47:35.562 --> 00:47:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Every breakfast, she would
have the hugest breakfast.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:39.130 align:middle line:90%
She'd never eaten breakfast.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So I never told
her what to have,

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:84%
but she'd have like eight
Weet-Bix and banana,

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.110 align:middle line:90%
which was-- is huge.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a huge meal.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Or she'd have
oatmeal and banana.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And for dessert, she'd
have yogurt and fruit.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, come June,
she'd lost 26 kilos--

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.835 align:middle line:90%
>> --which was-- which is huge.

00:47:56.835 --> 00:47:57.635 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:57.635 --> 00:48:00.550 align:middle line:84%
She went from a
size 20 to a size 8.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's happened since
June is she doesn't exercise

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.070 align:middle line:84%
She eats pretty much
the same, but she also

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:10.090 align:middle line:90%
treats herself all the time.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.160 align:middle line:84%
She hasn't put on 100
grams of that weight--

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --because the fat switch has
been switched off in her brain

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:16.170 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.522 align:middle line:84%
>> And she did interval training
without even knowing what it

00:48:19.522 --> 00:48:21.432 align:middle line:84%
was because she'd
walk every day.

00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And then she got bored with
that, so she'd run a bit.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And she'd walk,
and she'd run a bit.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So she's now at a stage where
she's the most positive person

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever met
and encourages me now.

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I need
to lose weight.

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it's actually
not that hard, mum.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I just wanted to
share that with you anyway.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And you could tell--

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.870 align:middle line:84%
if you ask her to send
me an email sometime,

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.420 align:middle line:84%
jon@gabrielmethod, ask
her to send me an email.

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to talk to her
and congratulate her.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you the truth.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.600 align:middle line:84%
It's been my experience
that kids are actually--

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier to get a kid
to lose weight than an adult.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Because once you just go in
the right direction with it

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and they develop the momentum,
man, they run with it.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:02.707 align:middle line:90%
They run with it.

00:49:02.707 --> 00:49:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's an incredible thing
to watch a kid just totally

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:90%
transform.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It really is, so thanks
for sharing that story.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.650 align:middle line:84%
My grandson is two
and a half years old,

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:90%
and he's never had nuts.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:20.175 align:middle line:84%
Would it be safe to start him
on a bit of flaxseed sprinkles?

00:49:20.175 --> 00:49:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I wouldn't think--

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.315 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't know why not.

00:49:22.315 --> 00:49:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But check with your doctor first
before you have any questions.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thanks.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:31.195 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly, we've
done that with my kids

00:49:31.195 --> 00:49:32.070 align:middle line:90%
and my friend's kids.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.310 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.870 align:middle line:84%
You were saying that they
need to eat all their dinner

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.100 align:middle line:90%
before their dessert.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Would that cause
overeating because they

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.630 align:middle line:90%
want to get to the dessert?

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that--

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I think it's sort of like a
kind of reverse psychology

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:90%
type of thing.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's much healthier
than saying, don't eat that,

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have enough,
because at least there's

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:90%
a message of excess there.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.857 align:middle line:84%
And again, maybe
in the short term,

00:49:58.857 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to lose weight.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the long term, you're
communicating to your body

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that there's excess
of food out there,

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and then food doesn't
become that exciting.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little bit--

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.660 align:middle line:84%
with food is sort of like-- to
me, food's like a relationship.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:17.095 align:middle line:84%
With a relationship, like
you just meet somebody,

00:50:17.095 --> 00:50:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and you fall in love
with them, and you

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.260 align:middle line:84%
don't know when you're
going to see them again.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And all you want-- all you
do is think about them.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:90%
And do they like you?

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.735 align:middle line:90%
And do you like them?

00:50:23.735 --> 00:50:26.898 align:middle line:84%
And there's just this magnetism
between the two of you

00:50:26.898 --> 00:50:28.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's forbidden,
and you don't

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.910 align:middle line:84%
know when you're going to--
when it's going to happen

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:30.810 align:middle line:90%
or where they are.

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And then like two
years down the road,

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.560 align:middle line:84%
they're sitting in your
couch, and then watching

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.780 align:middle line:84%
football all day, and just
hanging out on the couch,

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and you can't wait to get
rid of them at that point.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
there all the time.

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, food's a little
bit like that too.

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.310 align:middle line:84%
When there's all this food that
you can't have, you walk by,

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, I don't
want to look at it.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.597 align:middle line:90%
And, ooh, it looks really good.

00:50:48.597 --> 00:50:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And could I just smell it?

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.480 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.230 align:middle line:90%
There's all this attachment.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.040 align:middle line:90%
There's this attraction to it.

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:84%
But when you can have
whatever you want,

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:84%
it just becomes an old
thing after a while.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
it's exciting.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But then after
that, you lose it.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.790 align:middle line:90%
You lose the attraction to it.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.162 align:middle line:90%
You lose the affinity for it.

00:51:04.162 --> 00:51:05.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's like that with kids.

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:08.850 align:middle line:84%
When there's all these
things that a kid can't have,

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:84%
then that's all
they want is that.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.173 align:middle line:84%
But if you're saying,
finish your dinner first,

00:51:13.173 --> 00:51:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and then you can have
it, you're communicating

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:16.298 align:middle line:90%
that there's an excess there.

00:51:16.298 --> 00:51:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're just over food
when they can have it.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.797 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
of reverse psychology.

00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:24.630 align:middle line:84%
But it works in the
long term to communicate

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.234 align:middle line:90%
that there's an excess there.

00:51:26.234 --> 00:51:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this only kids questions?

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.342 align:middle line:84%
>> What's a good grinder
to grind your flaxseeds?

00:51:33.342 --> 00:51:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> A good grinder, yeah,
just any kind of cof--

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you use a coffee grinder?

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Any kind of coffee grinder or
a mortar and pestle will work.

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And about emotional obesity--

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:42.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:42.825 --> 00:51:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --and this might
apply to a lot of people,

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.940 align:middle line:84%
which is why I'm
presenting this.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Every time a really
good something

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.460 align:middle line:84%
would come up in
the family's life,

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I would always have
to lose weight.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:56.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But now my older son
is getting married,

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and that thought
hasn't occurred to me.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.188 align:middle line:84%
So does that mean I've dealt
with the emotional obesity?

00:52:04.188 --> 00:52:04.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.824 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:06.824 --> 00:52:08.280 align:middle line:90%


00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:14.596 align:middle line:90%
It's only like something.

00:52:14.596 --> 00:52:15.770 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:19.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:52:19.616 --> 00:52:20.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You said in your book that
you got to a point where you

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:90%
just accepted.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I did, yeah.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:27.490 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you do that?

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.988 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
learn how to let go?

00:52:29.988 --> 00:52:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was a really
important point for me is it

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:90%
was that--

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:38.232 align:middle line:84%
well, what used to happen
to me was like, I'd get up--

00:52:38.232 --> 00:52:40.065 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I first
got up to 100 kilos.

00:52:40.065 --> 00:52:41.075 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be like--

00:52:41.075 --> 00:52:45.020 align:middle line:84%
or 220 pounds, and be like,
oh, 100 kilos, you're so fat.

00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.170 align:middle line:90%
You go, I can't believe it.

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And so I'd try to lose weight.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.420 align:middle line:90%
And I'd lose maybe 5 kilos.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:49.712 align:middle line:90%
And next thing I know, I'm 100.

00:52:49.712 --> 00:52:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd gain back,
and I'm 110 kilos.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I just wanted
to be 100 kilos again.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.450 align:middle line:90%
So now I'm 110 kilos.

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, I can believe
you're 110 kilos.

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:57.480 align:middle line:90%
You're so fat.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go on a diet
and lose a little bit.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Next thing, I'm 120 kilos.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Now I just want to be 110 again.

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.192 align:middle line:84%
And this would go
on, and on, and on,

00:53:03.192 --> 00:53:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and on until I got over
180-some-odd kilos or 400

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.440 align:middle line:90%
pounds.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I give up.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I have to
live the rest of my life

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:84%
at 400 pounds or 180-some
kilos, I accept that.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.074 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want to
gain anymore weight.

00:53:19.074 --> 00:53:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, I'd just say, OK.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I finally accepted it.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, that really
helped turn things around.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It just happened.

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it happened as a
form of surrender, really.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.600 align:middle line:84%
It just happened
like, that's it.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.820 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten the gist of it.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- this
pattern, I'm not letting

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.420 align:middle line:90%
this pattern go on any further.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm just, that's it.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I accept the weight I am.

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.857 align:middle line:84%
If this is me, this
is me, and that's it.

00:53:40.857 --> 00:53:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really
important point for me

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.080 align:middle line:90%
to come to, definitely, yeah.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Jon.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.105 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:53:49.105 --> 00:53:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Just sorry.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Me?

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hi.

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a niece and
nephew that are really,

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.150 align:middle line:90%
really overweight.

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:57.193 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can seriously relate
to them because I spent my whole

00:53:57.193 --> 00:53:59.770 align:middle line:84%
life being overweight
as a child.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can try to convince
them to lose the weight

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.850 align:middle line:90%
or to eat healthy foods.

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But if they've got no
self-worth to begin with--

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> --how do they do it?

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've, you
know-- now, as an adult.

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:10.640 align:middle line:90%
You-- that's right.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.932 align:middle line:84%
You don't-- the point is,
you don't hit it straight on.

00:54:12.932 --> 00:54:14.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't try to convince
them to eat healthy

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:15.923 align:middle line:90%
or to shame them.

00:54:15.923 --> 00:54:17.590 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to
be able to face it.

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.180 align:middle line:90%
They're too frustrated.

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.320 align:middle line:90%
They're too discouraged.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:23.150 align:middle line:84%
They're getting it from every
source, from their parents,

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.780 align:middle line:84%
from doctors, from their
kid-- from the teachers,

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.940 align:middle line:84%
from kids mercilessly
letting them know.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's brutal, and
they've blocked it out.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you just simply
focus on adding foods

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that are nutritious without
even them even knowing it,

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and healthy foods that they
don't even know are healthy,

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and then learning how
to deal with stresses,

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and especially having omega
3s because it will increase

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.305 align:middle line:84%
their concentration
and their focus,

00:54:49.305 --> 00:54:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll start to
have more and more energy

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:52.660 align:middle line:90%
and participate in sports.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And you develop a
positive momentum

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.530 align:middle line:84%
at a grassroots level
like that with them.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Then you can take them,
and turn them around,

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, let's
run with this.

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.200 align:middle line:84%
You see you've lost
a little weight.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:03.730 align:middle line:84%
You see you're getting
in better shape.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You see you can try out for
the sport, whatever it is.

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.482 align:middle line:90%
Let's run with it now.

00:55:08.482 --> 00:55:09.282 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:09.282 --> 00:55:10.082 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:55:10.082 --> 00:55:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Jon, Jon.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm fortunate in that my
children are naturally

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.270 align:middle line:84%
very active, so they
don't have a weight issue

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:23.110 align:middle line:84%
but refuse to eat
fruit, full stop,

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:26.130 align:middle line:90%
and refuse to eat live food.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
get them to eat it,

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:90%
even though we eat it at dinner.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.503 align:middle line:90%
And I serve it.

00:55:32.503 --> 00:55:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep eating it at dinner.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> They just won't eat it.

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep serving it.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't push it on them.

00:55:36.010 --> 00:55:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't push it on them.

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Don't push anything on them.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Keep eating it at dinner.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.423 align:middle line:90%
Keep serving it at dinner.

00:55:40.423 --> 00:55:42.040 align:middle line:90%
Keep eating it at dinner.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that they're
getting healthy foods

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:48.257 align:middle line:84%
through these other methods with
like eating healthy foods that

00:55:48.257 --> 00:55:49.840 align:middle line:84%
don't seem like
they're healthy foods,

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.760 align:middle line:84%
the super delicious,
super nutritious

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.630 align:middle line:90%
foods that we're talking about.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.270 align:middle line:90%
And over time, keep trying.

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Keep introducing it.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.466 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:59.466 --> 00:56:01.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, we have
a little bit of a--

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:01.960 align:middle line:90%
where's Jack?

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Last one.

00:56:02.363 --> 00:56:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Last one, Jon.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, after that, we're going--

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to bring Harrison.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, Jack?

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Jon.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a four-year-old
who goes to the child care.

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have complaints
regarding his eating habits

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:15.490 align:middle line:84%
in the sense he would eat
his vegetables and fruits all

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.585 align:middle line:90%
the time, by himself as well.

00:56:17.585 --> 00:56:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The only issue is that he
loves too much of his chocolate

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.190 align:middle line:90%
and ketchup.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:22.600 align:middle line:90%
So how to control that?

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I missed a little
bit of the question.

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:25.830 align:middle line:90%
He's doing what?

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:27.997 align:middle line:84%
>> He is eating his fruits
and vegetables very well.

00:56:27.997 --> 00:56:28.797 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:56:28.797 --> 00:56:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> He loves them.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's only the
chocolate and the ketchup,

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:32.620 align:middle line:90%
how to control that.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the
chocolate, you know,

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.740 align:middle line:84%
chocolate can be really
healthy if you make it--

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:38.620 align:middle line:84%
you can make it with xylitol
and with organic cocoa.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.392 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a really
healthy thing,

00:56:40.392 --> 00:56:42.850 align:middle line:84%
like I say, like the chocolate
mousses or the chocolate ice

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:90%
cream that we make.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.440 align:middle line:90%
So he can have that.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Technically, you can
make healthy ketchup.

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.690 align:middle line:90%
But let him have his ketchup.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:50.350 align:middle line:84%
If he's eating the
healthy food too,

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.850 align:middle line:84%
keep the focus on
the healthy thing,

00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and let him have his ketchup,
and make healthy chocolates.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and so I just--

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.262 align:middle line:90%


00:57:00.262 --> 00:57:02.610 align:middle line:84%
we have a little bit of
a treat for you today

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:05.350 align:middle line:90%
that I've never done before.

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:06.550 align:middle line:90%
I've got someone that--

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:11.220 align:middle line:84%
coming up here to
sing us a song.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.800 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready, Jack?

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.705 align:middle line:90%
Where's Harrison?

00:57:13.705 --> 00:57:17.410 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:19.463 align:middle line:90%
Where's Harrison?

00:57:19.463 --> 00:57:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here he comes out.

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.680 align:middle line:84%
This is Harrison Craig-- is no
relation to Jenny, Jenny Craig.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.288 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:25.288 --> 00:57:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And look how thin he is.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:31.190 align:middle line:84%
No, just-- he's a beautiful,
really gifted singer.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
bring him up here

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and let him sing a song for us.

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.696 align:middle line:90%
So let's give him a hand.

>> (SINGING) This is the moment.

00:57:55.392 --> 00:58:02.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the day when
I send all my doubts

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.094 align:middle line:90%
and demons on their way.

00:58:06.094 --> 00:58:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Every endeavor I
have made ever is

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:23.670 align:middle line:84%
coming into play, is
here and now today.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:27.086 align:middle line:90%
This is the moment.

00:58:27.086 --> 00:58:34.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the time when the
momentum and the moment

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:90%
are in rhyme.

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Give me this moment,
this precious chance.

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll gather up my past and
make some sense at last.

00:58:54.410 --> 00:59:03.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment when all
I've done, all of the dreaming,

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:09.060 align:middle line:84%
scheming, and
screaming become one.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the day.

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:17.390 align:middle line:84%
See it sparkle and
shine when all I've

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:24.348 align:middle line:90%
lived for becomes mine.

00:59:24.348 --> 00:59:32.797 align:middle line:84%
Through all the years,
I faced the world alone.

00:59:32.797 --> 00:59:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And now the time has
come to prove to them

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:41.240 align:middle line:90%
I've made it on my own.

00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:49.698 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment,
my final test.

00:59:49.698 --> 00:59:51.186 align:middle line:90%
Destiny beckoned.

00:59:51.186 --> 00:59:56.642 align:middle line:90%
I never reckoned second best.

00:59:56.642 --> 00:59:59.618 align:middle line:90%
I won't look down.

00:59:59.618 --> 01:00:03.586 align:middle line:90%
I must not crawl.

01:00:03.586 --> 01:00:14.994 align:middle line:84%
And this is the moment, the
sweetest moment of them all.

01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:18.466 align:middle line:90%
This is the moment.

01:00:18.466 --> 01:00:22.434 align:middle line:90%
Damn all the odds.

When I look back, I will always
recall, moment for moment,

this was the moment, the
greatest moment of them all.
