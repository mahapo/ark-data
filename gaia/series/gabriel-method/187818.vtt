00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You guys taste the
breakfast we made?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> (ALL) Yeah.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That they affectionately
called Jonny Chow.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Was it any good?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:90%
You guys like it?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> (ALL)Yes.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, what you'll discover
from that what, you ate,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:84%
is that it's not going to
have the same type of response

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
in your body to a typical
meal, where you eat a lot

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
a lot of energy,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and then an hour or
two hours later you're

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:90%
tired and hungry again.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:84%
What you're going
to find is that it

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:90%
stays it stays with you.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So when we take
a break for lunch

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in a little while,
when you go eat lunch,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.298 align:middle line:84%
you're going to probably
notice that you're not

00:00:56.298 --> 00:00:58.155 align:middle line:84%
as hungry as you
otherwise would have been.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to make probably

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:90%
different food choices.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not going be looking for
that deep fried, quicky type

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to make
more conscious choices.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you'll notice.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite parts
about coming to the seminar

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is meeting people and hearing
their stories about some

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
of the successes that they've
had with The Gabriel Method

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.172 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them up and
sharing with you their stories.

00:01:26.172 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
a couple of people

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.487 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to call up before
we get started on this section.

00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
One of them is someone
who I've talked

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.245 align:middle line:84%
to via the internet a few
times and haven't met yet.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:90%
But I hear he's here.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really looking
forward to meeting him.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's Myles.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Myles is a-- if you're
here, are you here, Myles?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.637 align:middle line:90%
Can you come up?

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Can you give Myles a hand?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.688 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a
microphone for Myles?

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:90%
How're you doing?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Jon.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to meet you.

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:58.756 align:middle line:90%
I think we got a--

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
do we-- we have a
picture of Myles too.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:90%
How do I do that?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's Myles, yeah.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations, Myles.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.632 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you look incredible.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So how much weight
have you lost?

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> 47 kilos now.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a really,
really good journey.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I've really, really enjoyed it.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And you know, as
each parts come off,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
feeling that much better,
that much healthier,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:90%
that much more active.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- oh, it's
been so fantastic.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.885 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much, Jon,
for the book and everything.

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:41.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It really has worked, and
that complete life change

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Who knows where I'd be
further down the track

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
if I was still that sort of
overweight and struggling

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:90%
person--

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> --without knowing all
those-- all the things.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
All the things that
you teach, yeah.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks very much.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me get a picture.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.397 align:middle line:90%
Can you get a picture?

00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Just need a picture.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Can you get-- a picture of us.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:90%
That's all right.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.095 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it later.

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, here.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Myles.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.151 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And where's Trudy?

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Trudy, can you come up?

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
We'll just do-- we're not
going to do this all day.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:90%
We'll just do a couple.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.528 align:middle line:90%
And maybe will do some later.

00:03:25.528 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But I-- just, this is
definitely the fun part.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Not that it's not all fun.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Here's Trudy.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us--

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my story is nowhere
near as dramatic,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't really
have a lot to lose.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
But I was uncomfortable
in myself.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I was about 15 kilos overweight.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And most of that came on--
there was a lady earlier

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
who asked about whether you
put weight on at menopause.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes you do.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Very suddenly, I put
on 10 kilos, 12 kilos.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt my
self-confidence plummeting.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And then a year ago, last
October, I read your book.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And the scales
fell from my eyes.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought, wow, can it
really be that simple?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It was just absolutely amazing.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
What I came to understand
was that I was nutritionally

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:90%
starving myself.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to
add things to my diet,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.030 align:middle line:84%
like the flax seed and the
live food and the protein.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And instantly, the weight
started to fall off me.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was losing about
a kilo a week in the beginning.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So by Christmas, I
had lost 10 kilos.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I
also lost 10 years,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:84%
because I felt so much
more energized and just

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:90%
youthful and vital.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:90%
It was just fantastic.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's just kept
on going like that.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And-- I'm very happy.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about how to
deal with mental and emotional

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
stress and-- oh, I'm
sorry, how to deal

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
with the physical stresses
that activate the fat programs.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience,
it's really essential

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to give you more energy,
to nourish your body,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
to deal with things like sleep
apnea and dehydration, toxins.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But also, in my experience,
mental and emotional stress,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
dealing with mental
and emotional stress

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:84%
is much, much, much
more important.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It causes those same
things like the ins--

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
causes your body to stop
listening to insulin.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
It causes all these
other hormonal problems.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.445 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, it's
not about food anymore.

00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
you can be looking

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
at this diet and that diet, and
all of these different things.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But if the stresses
in your life are

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
activating your fat programs,
that has to be addressed.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And just recently,
mainstream, modern day science

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
is starting to
acknowledge and understand

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
the importance of stress and
the connection between stress

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and obesity.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was a show on
the ABC a couple of months

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
ago that I thought
was really good,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.147 align:middle line:84%
a documentary, that
kind of emphasized this.

00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking a little
bit of a clip from that.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
run that right now

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
before we start talking about
stress and how to deal with it.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:90%
So can we run that clip?

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
- This is cardiologist Jeffrey
Ritterman's regular commute.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
- You can learn a lot about
the stress and health outcome

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
just from the
neighborhoods you visit.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this neighborhood, the
life expectancy is quite good.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And most of the people
are pretty healthy.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we reach the
top to the hill,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
it gets to be a little
bit less privileged.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And as we make this
transition, the social status

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:90%
begins to drop.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And correspondingly,
in those areas,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
the health outcome
is much worse.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And these people are not
going to have the same life

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:84%
expectancy as the people
in the middle class

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:90%
area we started in.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
People are on guard.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:90%
People are vigilant.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
They're living a
more stressful life.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a community that
produces high stress hormones

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:90%
in people.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it
takes its toll.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
- One of Dr. Ritterman's
patients is 65-year-old

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Emmanuel Johnson.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:90%
His career?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Guidance counselor in one
of America's most dangerous

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
neighborhoods.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
- Well, last year, I
think we had 47 homicides.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.980 align:middle line:84%
In the last four days, we had
11 shootings, three deaths.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.285 align:middle line:90%
- Get ready and--

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
- And I did know, nine
times out of 10, it's

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
going to be a relative of
someone that the kids know.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:84%
- For Emmanuel Johnson, there
is a price for chronic exposure

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.895 align:middle line:90%
to this stress.

00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
- Five years ago I
had a heart attack.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm a diabetic too.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I have to work on it
constantly, because I've

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:90%
been in this business 20 years.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's just-- it's stressful
just working the job.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, the
cholesterol, the blood

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:84%
pressure, sugar came on
later, but distress was always

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.495 align:middle line:90%
there long before they came on.

00:08:22.495 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
- Emanuel Johnson's
body may be telling

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.580 align:middle line:90%
yet another story of stress.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:84%
The Whitehall Study in England
found an incredible link

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.270 align:middle line:84%
between stress, your position
in the social hierarchy,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.448 align:middle line:90%
and how you put on weight.

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:42.500 align:middle line:84%
- So it may not be just
putting on weight, but also

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:90%
the distribution of that weight.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And the distribution
of that weight,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
putting it on around
the center, is related

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to position in the hierarchy.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And that in turn may be related
to chronic stress pathways.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
- So we said, does
that happen in monkeys?

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they organize
themselves in a hierarchy too.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out that it does.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Subordinate monkeys
are more likely to have

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.550 align:middle line:84%
fat in their abdomen than
are dominant monkeys.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
amazing observation

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that I've made in my lab is this
idea that stress could actually

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
change the way you
deposit fat on your body.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was a bizarre idea,
that you could actually alter

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:90%
the way fat is distributed.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
- Sapolsky, Shively,
and others think

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
stress could be a critical
factor in the global obesity

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
epidemic.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Even worse, fat brought on
by stress is dangerous fat.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
- We know that fat
carried on the trunk

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
or actually inside the
abdomen is much worse for you

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
than fat carried
elsewhere on the body.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It behaves differently.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It produces different kinds
of hormones and chemicals

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and has different
effects on your health.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
works for an individual,

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:84%
they need to value
stress reduction.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
I think the problem
in our society

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't value
stress reduction.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:90%
We, in fact, value the opposite.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
We admire the person who,
not only multitasks and does

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.630 align:middle line:84%
two things at once, but
does five things at once.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:90%
We kind of admire that person.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:90%
How do they manage that?

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's incredibly
stressful way to live.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to change our
values and value people

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.650 align:middle line:84%
who understand a
balanced and serene life.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.122 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:45.114 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:45.114 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So stress basically--
stress causes chemistry.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So every time you have any type
of mental and emotional stress,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cause real
physical, tangible chemistry

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And stress is an
alarm to your body.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:90%
It's saying, something's wrong.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.820 align:middle line:90%
There's a threat out there.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And every time you have
stress, your body you've

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:90%
always does three things--

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.205 align:middle line:90%
I R A. It Interprets the stress.

00:11:16.205 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It Reacts to the stress.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.160 align:middle line:90%
And it Adapts to the stress.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you were living
outdoors 1,000 years ago

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're chased by
a tiger, your body

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:90%
has to interpret the stress.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%
What's the stress?

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Tiger, right?

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:90%
What's the reaction?

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Run like hell.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:90%
What's the adaptation?

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Get thin.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
The adaptation, get thin,
get strong, get fast,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
so that the next time
that tiger comes,

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
you are better adapted
to your environment.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You are more able and suited
to surviving the threat.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:90%
So what's the survival threat?

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:90%
How do we react to it?

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
How do we adapt to it?

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
If you were in a famine,
the interpretation,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
famine; the reaction,
get hungry, slow down;

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
your metabolism, store fat;
the adaptation, get fatter.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So that the next time there's a
famine, you will have adapted.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
You are more able to
survive the threat.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're
sitting at your desk

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're watching the
stock market and it tanks,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.750 align:middle line:84%
you're sending a survival
threat, chemical message

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
to your body.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.950 align:middle line:90%
What's the interpretation?

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Who the hell knows.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Your body doesn't know
what a stock market is.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know
what up or down is.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know what a job is.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know what a
mortgage is, a credit card.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:90%
What's the interpretation?

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Is it a famine?

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it a tiger?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.267 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:13:25.267 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:90%
What's the reaction?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it thinks it's
a famine, you get hungry.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:90%
You slow down, you get fatter.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And your body wants to be fed.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
If it thinks it's a tiger,
your blood starts pumping.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to run.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:90%
You're ready to fight.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And you get thinner.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is going on all
the time, all day long.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Every time you have a thought--

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
how am I going to make my
mortgage payment, what's

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.712 align:middle line:84%
going to happen when boss is
mad at me, how are my kids going

00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:90%
to graduate from college--

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
every time you have a thought,
you're causing chemistry.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.050 align:middle line:90%
And your body's reacting to it.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.678 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
it's adapting to it.

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have stress,
your body's thinking,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.880 align:middle line:90%
do I get fatter or thinner?

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And for some of us, the
adaptation is fatter.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So chronic stress can, for
some people, in some instances,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
cause a kind of chronic
situation, where these stress

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
hormones are chronically
elevated in the same pattern

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:90%
as if you were in a famine.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a famine day in
and day out, you're hungry.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:90%
It's causing that same thing.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:90%
So it'll trick your body.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So chronic stress
has to be dealt with.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
flax seeds from now

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:84%
until the next century,
and if chronic stress

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is active in your fat
programs, it's not

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:90%
going to do anything for you.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It'll help a little.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:84%
It'll give you a
little more energy.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
It will deal with this
insulin problem a little bit.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It'll make you clear and
hopefully get off medication

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:90%
and now make you less stressful.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
do with the real issue.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So we need techniques and tools
for dealing with the real issue

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.480 align:middle line:90%
of chronic stress.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:90%
That's one area.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:90%
So one area is chronic stress.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We need techniques,
tools, and strategies

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:90%
to deal with chronic stress.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
The other-- and this is for
people that have serious

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
problems and lifetime
weight problems and is much,

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:90%
much more important--

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
is something I call
emotional obesity.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Emotional obesity is different
than emotional eating.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Emotional eating is
eating because you're

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
tired, lonely, sad,
whatever, frustrated, bored.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
That's emotional eating,
and everybody does that.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Emotional obesity
is the actual need

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:90%
to be fat in order to feel safe.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I had that.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.947 align:middle line:90%
I had emotional obesity.

00:16:08.947 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I was able to deal

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.947 align:middle line:84%
with the emotional obesity
that I was able to lose weight.

00:16:12.947 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:90%
I felt safer being thin.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Do remember I told you before
that I had this business

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:84%
partner that was angry,
aggressive, and throwing

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
things?

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I was really uncomfortable
around this person.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
He reminded me of
situations when I was a kid.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a person
in my life that

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
used to used to beat
me up on a daily basis

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid, that
was very similar to him

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.443 align:middle line:84%
in his temperament
and his disposition.

00:16:35.443 --> 00:16:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And I have these childhood
memories, these childhood

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:90%
associations.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you have childhood
trauma or past trauma,

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
it actually gets locked
into the cells of your body.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like your cells
have a conscious memory

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
of these things.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk
about it forever.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
But on a cellular
level, you're still

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
going to have that
fear until you

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
learn how to deal with the
issue on a cellular level.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:90%
So I had that.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I had this fear, I
had this discomfort.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was triggering me and
triggering me, triggering me.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time I
was with him, I felt--

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I actually felt safer
being thinner for two--

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:90%
fatter for two reasons.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
One, because I was creating like
a buffer between me and him.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
same way fat protects you

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:84%
from a hostile environment,
like cold weather,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
it insulates your
organs, fat protects you

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:84%
from a hostile, negative
space, a hostile, negative

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:23.881 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:17:23.881 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
It also protects
you energetically.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Because when somebody is
angry and hostile and abusive,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
they're giving out
negative energy.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are energies.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:90%
And we all know that now.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.435 align:middle line:84%
There's been lots of documented
studies, like Dr. Masaru

00:17:35.435 --> 00:17:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Emoto's "Messages from
Water," how thoughts

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:90%
can change water molecules.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts are tangible energies.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And fat protects you
from negative energy.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And the way I
discovered this was

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
when I was over 400
pounds, or 180 kilos,

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:90%
I went to get a chest X-ray.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And the X-ray didn't show up.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The fat had absorbed
the radiation,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:90%
or the negative energy.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody is negative
at you, fat's absorbing that.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a buffer.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It protects you.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.430 align:middle line:90%
I felt safer.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.383 align:middle line:84%
Also, the bigger
I got, the safer

00:18:09.383 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I felt against if anything
ever became violent against us.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, it never did, and
that wasn't his nature

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
to actually be physical.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:90%
He was just angry.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
But when I was younger,
I had the associations

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.423 align:middle line:90%
of being abused physically.

00:18:21.423 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:90%
And I had a cellular memory.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.700 align:middle line:90%
So it was triggering that.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:84%
The bigger I got,
the safer I found.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I was
twice his size.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid of him.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.392 align:middle line:90%
I could sit on him.

00:18:34.392 --> 00:18:35.718 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.718 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I could squash him
like a pancake.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.260 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid of him.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But I felt safer
with the weight.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you feel
safer with the weight,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.080 align:middle line:84%
nothing else is going to
work but dealing with that.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Your body's trying
to protect you.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know what
the interpretation is.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
It only knows that you
feel safe for being thin--

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:90%
being fat.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to activate
this famine response.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:90%
That's all it knows.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.968 align:middle line:90%
And that has to be dealt with.

00:19:18.968 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And emotional obesity
is a little bit

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:84%
like, you know how sometimes
you're looking for your keys

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and you have a feeling
they're under the bed,

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:84%
but you don't feel like bending
down and going under the bed

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and looking for it.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So you look in the same
places over and over again.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
I do this all the time.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And you look on your
kitchen counter,

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.145 align:middle line:90%
your table, your closet.

00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You keep going to
the same places

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's not until you actually
bend down and go under the bed

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and get the keys
that you find them.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And you will not have your
keys until you find them.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Emotional obesity
is the same thing.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I would rather you
spent all of your time

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:84%
working on emotional obesity,
if you have the slightest

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
hint that you have it,
than anything else I'm

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.952 align:middle line:84%
talking about, because
everything else will

00:19:56.952 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:84%
fall into place once you
feel safer being thin.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know if you have
emotional obesity usually.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
kind of like a test.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.218 align:middle line:84%
Like, I remember one
time, the first time

00:20:13.218 --> 00:20:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I gave a big talk in Perth
was at the Burswood theater

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.527 align:middle line:90%
and there was--

00:20:16.527 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I was invited there.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a seminar I was doing.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's hundreds of people,
maybe 500 or 600 people.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:90%
I'd never given a talk before.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.785 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
exciting experience for me.

00:20:24.785 --> 00:20:26.285 align:middle line:84%
And afterwards, I
had this lady, she

00:20:26.285 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:90%
was emailing me all the time.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're a genius.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's ever worked for me.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Every-- my clothes are
just falling off me.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.550 align:middle line:84%
I have to buy new
clothes, blah, blah, blah.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And every week, she's
sending me an email.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.257 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, she
sends me an email.

00:20:38.257 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
She goes, oh, I had
a really bad week.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
She said, I remember I was
walking down the street

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and somebody said to
me, oh, you look great.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:90%
And I freaked out.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't handle that.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And I had a bad--

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:90%
And she just said that.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, let's
talk, because I

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:54.988 align:middle line:90%
knew what was going on.

00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, when she
was a teenager, for example,

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
she had a date that
went out of control.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really
painful experience for her.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.237 align:middle line:84%
And ever since
then, she just feels

00:21:06.237 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
really uncomfortable
being attractive,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
because she doesn't want
to repeat that experience.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's the case, your
body's going to protect you.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you're losing the
weight, you're losing weight,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:84%
but you're not
addressing the fact

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that your body wants
to be fat, you're

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
just driving with the
emergency brake on.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.622 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole
crux of the issue.

00:21:23.622 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And I had another lady, the
first time I was on television,

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
she called me and she told me a
story she'd never told anyone.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was that when
she was 10 years old,

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
she was being abused
by a babysitter.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
a female babysitter.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time
she was being abused--

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.740 align:middle line:90%
this went on for three years--

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.448 align:middle line:84%
she was gaining weight
and gaining weight

00:21:43.448 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:90%
and gaining weight.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, she
gained so much weight

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
that the babysitter
stopped abusing her.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The babysitter goes, oh,
my god, you're so gross

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.930 align:middle line:90%
and stopped abusing her.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.590 align:middle line:84%
But in that instance, fat
really did protect her.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Fat saved her life,
when no one else could.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And now 30 years down the road,
what do you think's happening?

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Every time she loses
weight on a diet,

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
something happens, she freaks
out, she gains the weight.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
What's freaking out is,
on a cellular level,

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't feel
safe being thin.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.253 align:middle line:90%
That has to be addressed.

00:22:17.253 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And I have kind of a quick way
now, when I talk to people,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
I can zero in pretty quickly.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll talk
to someone, I'll

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, how much weight
do you want to lose?

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to lose 40 kilos
and blah, blah, bah.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I go, OK, I want you to imagine
you're walking down the street

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're in your
perfect ideal shape.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And everything's flowing in
your life, and it's beautiful,

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.473 align:middle line:90%
I feel great.

00:22:35.473 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So now you're walking
down the street.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got so much
energy coming out of you.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.473 align:middle line:84%
And you just look
so beautiful, you're

00:22:41.473 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
so attractive that people
can't help but notice you.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.070 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.153 align:middle line:90%
They're just noticing you.

00:22:46.153 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
You're walking down the
street, they're turning.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:90%
They can't help but look at you.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.026 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel now?

00:22:53.026 --> 00:22:56.178 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, people will say,
oh, I'm not feeling so good.

00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Or some people say, no,
I don't like that at all.

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't want attention.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes I imagine
I bring them up on stage,

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:90%
oh, you don't get attention?

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you're up on stage
and there's thousands of people

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.290 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.248 align:middle line:84%
And there's a spotlight
on you and they're just

00:23:08.248 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:90%
looking at you.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.753 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel now?

00:23:10.753 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I try to bring
it out of them.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.462 align:middle line:84%
And if there's the slightest
bit of uncomfortableness--

00:23:14.462 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and you can try this--

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
if there's the slightest
bit of discomfort,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
then you've got--
then your body,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.585 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- you're
not comfortable.

00:23:22.585 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
You're not comfortable
with the weight.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.752 align:middle line:84%
And you could be a male or
female for various reasons.

00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when I'm
working with you and I say,

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.793 align:middle line:84%
well, just imagine these
beautiful white wings are

00:23:30.793 --> 00:23:33.760 align:middle line:84%
wrapped around you and that
people are looking at you,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.227 align:middle line:84%
but those wings
are shielding you.

00:23:35.227 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel now?

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And then instantly it changes.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.905 align:middle line:84%
And you've given
your body a message,

00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
you've communicated to your
body that there's a way

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.560 align:middle line:90%
to protect you without the fat.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Or a big column of light
that's protecting you.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to do that.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.390 align:middle line:84%
When we do a
visualization soon, I'll

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
include that in
the visualization,

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:90%
so you can see what that's like.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But just different tools,
visualization tools,

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.870 align:middle line:84%
for communicating
that you're thin.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So you have to deal with these
two things in different ways.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.182 align:middle line:84%
But the chronic stress
has to be dealt with.

00:24:07.182 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And the emotional obesity
has to be dealt with.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
ways to do it.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Then it's just a
question of application.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
But for the chronic stress,
the best way to deal with it

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of visualization
or meditation on a daily basis--

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:84%
before you go to
sleep at night, like

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
listening to the
visualization CD

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
that I put together, and then
first thing in the morning.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Meditation inhibits the
signals in your brain

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to a part of your brain
called the amygdala,

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
which is the seat of
fear and aggression.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it helps you
live a lower stress life

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and does so many
other things, which

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.337 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to talk more about.

00:24:45.337 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Which by the way,
people keep asking me

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.710 align:middle line:90%
when I'm doing another seminar.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The next thing we're doing is
going to be at the end of March

00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
in Kiama.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.457 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do like a
three- or four-day retreat,

00:24:57.457 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
where I can get into
this much deeper.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
that meditation

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
does for you that I don't have
time to get into right now.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to be doing
meditations, visualizations.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be doing
various super delicious,

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:90%
super nutritious recipes.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
in Kiama, which is

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
New South Wales at the end of
March, so a three-day retreat.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll spend three
full days together,

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:90%
going over everything.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'll talk there
more about meditation.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:84%
But meditation does so many
incredibly powerful things

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.988 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things it does is it

00:25:27.988 --> 00:25:32.070 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel safer
and reduces stress.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.488 align:middle line:84%
So on a daily basis,
doing some sort

00:25:34.488 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
of meditation or visualization,
which we're going

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.443 align:middle line:90%
to do in just a little while.

00:25:40.443 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And then dealing with
emotional obesity,

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:84%
now that's a little
bit more tricky.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:48.360 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those things that
either it happens like this,

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.110 align:middle line:84%
or it may take months, or it
may be a long time journey.

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:90%
But when it happens, it's done.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:90%
But it has to be dealt with.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've had some
really good successes

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:84%
with emotional obesity
referring people to different

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:90%
what I call energetic healers.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And those are people that
where you work with them

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and they help go back
through a childhood issue.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And once you've gone
through the childhood issue,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.100 align:middle line:84%
they work through it
on an energetic level

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.735 align:middle line:90%
to help yourselves release it.

00:26:24.735 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Finding an energy healer
won't-- another way to do it is,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
if you go a health food store
and you look on the billboard

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and you look at different
pictures of people,

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.215 align:middle line:84%
and you just see one that's
offering some sort of healing

00:26:35.215 --> 00:26:36.965 align:middle line:84%
technique, someone
that you resonate with,

00:26:36.965 --> 00:26:39.173 align:middle line:84%
that you feel safe with,
that you feel like they know

00:26:39.173 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:90%
something, contact them.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But you have to release the
trauma on a cellular level.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And that involves some work.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.250 align:middle line:90%
But that has to be done.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.635 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we do more
the intensive, like in Kiama,

00:26:56.635 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and also we're going to do a
five-day retreat in Thailand

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
in August, which we're
just putting together,

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
which I'm very excited about,
we can do more trauma release

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of great therapists

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and healers out there
that deal with trauma.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
trigger your weight--

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.213 align:middle line:84%
I always-- the first
question I always

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:13.297 align:middle line:84%
ask people is, when
did your weight start?

00:27:13.297 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was five years old,
when I was 20 years old, when

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I was 30 years old.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, my father was an
alcoholic and he beat me.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.237 align:middle line:90%
Or my uncle abused me.

00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Or we moved away.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.145 align:middle line:84%
Or there was a divorce,
there was cancer,

00:27:23.145 --> 00:27:25.270 align:middle line:90%
there was a car accident.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I started uni.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather died.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, if there's
a trigger to when your weight

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.855 align:middle line:84%
started, that's not
a chemical trigger--

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:84%
like I started taking medication
or something like that--

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
but if there's a trigger to
when your weight started,

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:90%
then that's where you go.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got to deal
with that issue.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was five
years ago, last month,

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.760 align:middle line:84%
or when you're
three years old, you

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.968 align:middle line:90%
have to deal with that issue.

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:90%
So both of these things--

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
chronic stress and emotional
stress and emotional obesity--

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
really come down to
how safe you feel.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:07.190 align:middle line:84%
If you could feel like an
inherent feeling of safety,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
whether right or
wrong, when your boss

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.447 align:middle line:84%
is yelling at you, if
you're feeling safe,

00:28:13.447 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:90%
you're not sending the messages.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.890 align:middle line:84%
If your partner is upset
at you or might leave you

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:84%
or some other
thing is happening,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeling
safe, you're not

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:90%
sending the chemical messages.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So from a weight
perspective, nothing

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.297 align:middle line:84%
is more important
than feeling safe.

00:28:32.297 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling safe and
someone said, you look great,

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.797 align:middle line:84%
or they're looking at you,
it doesn't intimidate you

00:28:36.797 --> 00:28:39.880 align:middle line:90%
or cause those feelings.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
An inherent feeling of safety
is in essence the greatest

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:90%
gift you can give yourself.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.182 align:middle line:84%
And you can program
that in through--

00:28:50.182 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:84%
again, through a
visualization that we're

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.080 align:middle line:90%
going to do in a little while.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:84%
You can program that
feeling of safety.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But just understanding--
if you could also

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
formulate a belief system,
a feeling of safety,

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.660 align:middle line:84%
because the world
is a safe place,

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
then you've taken
care of the issue too.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And being able to change
your beliefs to suit

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:16.370 align:middle line:90%
you is one of the great--

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
is an incredible thing you
can do to make you feel safe.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Changing your beliefs
instantly changes

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.170 align:middle line:84%
your emotional
environment, instantly

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.420 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel less
stressful, less fearful.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to give
you a perfect example.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's say it's 12 o'clock
in the afternoon on a Monday

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.070 align:middle line:84%
morning and you're supposed
to meet your spouse for lunch.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting out and
having a drink of water

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and just loving it.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's 12:15, and
they're still not there.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's 12:30, and
they're still not there.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it's 12:45, and
they're still not there.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.287 align:middle line:84%
And then it's 1 o'clock,
and they show up.

00:29:57.287 --> 00:29:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And they come out
and they go, oh, hi,

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:84%
how are you, dah, dah, dah,
what a great day, dah, dah, dah.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And how are you feeling?

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You're just like,
fine, whatever, right?

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And you're upset,
and you're angry.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And she has no
respect for my time.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:90%
And he always does this to me.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.318 align:middle line:84%
And all of these negative
thoughts and feelings

00:30:16.318 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:84%
are going through your head
that are causing stress,

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:90%
activating your fat programs.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting there at
a restaurant, having water,

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.216 align:middle line:84%
you're not eating anything,
and you're still getting fat.

00:30:32.216 --> 00:30:33.016 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:33.016 --> 00:30:35.032 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:35.032 --> 00:30:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they show up, and
they say, hi, how are you.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:90%
And you go, fine.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:90%
And they go, what's wrong?

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And you go, what's wrong?

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.850 align:middle line:90%
You're an hour late.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.930 align:middle line:84%
You know I was to be
here blah, blah, blah.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I'm
not an hour late.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:90%
It's 12 o'clock.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.108 align:middle line:84%
Daylight savings ended
yesterday, remember?

00:30:53.108 --> 00:30:54.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.300 align:middle line:90%
You didn't turn your clock back.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:90%
You were wrong.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:90%
So what changed?

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
In an instance, where did
all those feelings go?

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Those feelings of he has
no respect for my time,

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.927 align:middle line:84%
and she always does
this to me, and it's

00:31:09.927 --> 00:31:15.460 align:middle line:84%
all his fault and all her
fault, where did that all go?

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Gone in an instant.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
You change your assumption or
beliefs about the situation,

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and instantly, all of
the feelings change.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
The stress goes
away in an instant.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Let's take another example.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that it's 1
o'clock, and they show up,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and they really
are an hour late.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:35.900 align:middle line:90%
And you're angry.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.983 align:middle line:90%
And they go, what's wrong?

00:31:36.983 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, yeah, you're
right, I am an hour late.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow's your birthday.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting you
the car of your dreams.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And the paperwork took
a little bit longer

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:90%
than I thought I would.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.787 align:middle line:90%
And they hand you the keys.

00:31:53.787 --> 00:31:55.735 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.735 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And how do you feel now?

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was
doing this summer--

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.680 align:middle line:84%
when I said that, one
lady goes, suspicious.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.017 align:middle line:90%


00:32:08.017 --> 00:32:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, yeah, you've been
married for a long time.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Change your assumptions
around the situation,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and instantly, where did all
those negative emotions go?

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:84%
All that pain, all that
anger, all that betrayal,

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.690 align:middle line:84%
all that feeling like a
victim, all the wrongdoing,

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:90%
gone in an instant.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
If you change your feelings and
assumptions about the world,

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:84%
instantly all the
stress goes away.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you could develop just
an inherent feeling of safety

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:84%
based on a belief system that
supported that, then all day

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.433 align:middle line:90%
long, you're feeling safe.

00:32:40.433 --> 00:32:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And all day long, you're
not causing all this stress

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that's activating your fat
programs, if you could just

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
do that one thing.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And so for me--

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:84%
people kill and die
for their beliefs.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:90%
For me, beliefs are just tools.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if my
beliefs are right.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.710 align:middle line:90%
I would never defend my beliefs.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.510 align:middle line:90%
No one else has to believe them.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.020 align:middle line:90%
I just care if they support me.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And I do have a belief
system that supports me,

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:84%
because I do have a feeling
of safety about my life

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:84%
and about my place
in the universe.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel safe.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I didn't always.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.500 align:middle line:90%
I do now.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.580 align:middle line:90%
But I do feel safe.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons is
I developed just a feeling

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.535 align:middle line:84%
about the universe that maybe
this isn't all there is.

00:33:23.535 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a part of us
that just lives forever,

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:90%
and we're on a journey.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's not--

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to
adopt my beliefs.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to--

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not selling you
a belief system.

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But I want to introduce
a concept to you

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and just have you have the
thought that, if you could

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:84%
somehow develop a
feeling of safety

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:48.780 align:middle line:84%
around the world
that's it going to make

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you feel-- it's going
to make you lose weight,

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:90%
whether it's right or wrong.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So I remember
about 15 years ago,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a story about all
these billionaires in Russia,

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and how they had all
this money and they

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what to do with it.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So there was a service
in Russia for $50,000.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
You pay this service, you pay
them $50,000 for the right

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:15.785 align:middle line:90%
to go out and be homeless.

00:34:15.785 --> 00:34:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to live on the street.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to fend for
yourself, find food, sleep,

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:26.199 align:middle line:90%
shelter, all these things.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.940 align:middle line:84%
They will watch
you and make sure

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.760 align:middle line:84%
that you don't get killed
or harmed in any way.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:90%
So you're being monitored.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.179 align:middle line:84%
But other than that,
you're on your own.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why
would somebody do that?

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Why would they come
to this hostile place

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and pretend when they
had all this money?

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
The reason they did that is
because once they got back

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
to the penthouse, and all
their servants, would you

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:84%
like some more peeled grapes,
sir, and all of these things,

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.770 align:middle line:84%
they had a greater
appreciation for what

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.240 align:middle line:90%
it meant to be a billionaire.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.130 align:middle line:84%
For their money and
for their luxuries,

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.380 align:middle line:90%
they had a greater appreciation.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And you read all these
books and spiritual books,

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.400 align:middle line:84%
new age books,
whatever they are,

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and then everyone talks
about how we're this immortal

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:90%
being on a journey.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's true,
maybe it's not.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if it is.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:90%
But what if it was.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And what if we were
on this immortal--

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.060 align:middle line:84%
what if we were these infinite
beings or an immortal journey,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and coming to this
planet is part of that?

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself,
why would we do that?

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Why would we come to
a place like this?

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that it's really--

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
being on a place like Earth
is really the best gift

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.157 align:middle line:90%
you can give yourself.

00:35:41.157 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:84%
If you really are an
immortal, eternal being

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can have any
experience you want,

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.700 align:middle line:84%
then it just stands to reason
that sooner or later you'd

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.340 align:middle line:84%
come to a place where you
had the illusion of being

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:55.870 align:middle line:84%
a limited being, of
having to fight for love,

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.260 align:middle line:84%
money, resources, to having
a body that could die or be

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
harmed, having all these
horrible things that could

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:84%
happen to you, being
unsafe, it just

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.670 align:middle line:84%
stands to reason that you would
come to a place like this.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And part of the deal is
you would voluntarily

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:84%
agree to forgetting who you
really were, because otherwise

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.737 align:middle line:90%
you lose the whole point.

00:36:17.737 --> 00:36:18.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's like an adventure.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:90%
You forget who you are.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.380 align:middle line:90%
You sign off to amnesia.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.485 align:middle line:84%
And you go and you live
in this place, where

00:36:25.485 --> 00:36:26.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to fight
for everything,

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.902 align:middle line:84%
where everything is unsafe,
where life could end.

00:36:28.902 --> 00:36:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you came
back, you would

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:90%
remember who you truly were.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And you would remember
what an incredible gift

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're
infinite, immortal,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that love is everywhere,
that support is everywhere,

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and that your true nature
you never really die.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It just makes sense.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I adopted a
belief system like this,

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.060 align:middle line:90%
simply because it serves me.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if
it's right or wrong.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care if it conflicts
with anyone else's beliefs.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Nothing about it matters
to me, except for the fact

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.830 align:middle line:90%
that I feel safe.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:04.990 align:middle line:84%
If something were to
happen to me and I die,

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I live forever.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a part
of me keeps going.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
If some horrible thing happened
to me as a child, well,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.990 align:middle line:90%
maybe I wanted that to happen.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I agreed.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I knew what
was going to happen.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I wanted it to happen.

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:20.420 align:middle line:84%
That's inconceivable--
some of the things

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that I went through
and some of the things

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:90%
that other people go through.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
nothing compared

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to what some people go through.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Why would you do that?

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just to have
the experience,

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.985 align:middle line:84%
because you're in an infinite,
immortal being, maybe.

00:37:34.985 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So I have adopted a belief
like that, that makes

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.350 align:middle line:90%
me feel safe all the time.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And I can tell you, I feel safe.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You put me wherever
you want, I feel safe.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I live forever.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's true.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it isn't.

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
you to adopt it,

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:59.220 align:middle line:84%
certainly not if it conflicts
with your own personal beliefs.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:84%
But I do want you
to adopt a belief

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.380 align:middle line:90%
system that supports safety.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
simple way to do it.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.642 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about it right now.

00:38:08.642 --> 00:38:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is to do a simple
visualization that programs

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:90%
a feeling of safety in you.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Simply by, when you're in
a state of deep meditation,

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:84%
or what I call smart
mode, which I talk about,

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.760 align:middle line:84%
when you're in that
state, just by having

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.050 align:middle line:84%
your cells of your body
repeat over and over again,

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:27.940 align:middle line:84%
safe, safe, safe, you're
programming that consciousness

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.720 align:middle line:84%
on a cellular level
into your body.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So that you don't know why, but
your boss is yelling at you,

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and you just don't
feel that bad about it.

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you get the work done the
same way as if you had fear,

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.070 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have
a fear anymore.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You just react differently
to whatever the situation is.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.638 align:middle line:84%
And visualization
does so much for you

00:38:50.638 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:90%
from a weight loss perspective.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.268 align:middle line:84%
Visualizations are like a way
of communicating to your body

00:38:55.268 --> 00:38:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that you need to turn
off the fat programs,

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that you need to be thin,
because your body doesn't

00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:90%
speak English.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.535 align:middle line:90%
It can't say to you--

00:39:00.535 --> 00:39:03.035 align:middle line:84%
the part of your brain that's
in charge of the fat programs,

00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:84%
you can't say to it,
I want to lose weight

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.268 align:middle line:84%
because I won't look good
for a wedding in six months.

00:39:08.268 --> 00:39:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Your brain doesn't
what a wedding is.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter six months is,
doesn't know what looking good

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.480 align:middle line:90%
It just knows safe and not safe.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest problems
we have-- and nobody even

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.457 align:middle line:84%
knows that we have
it-- is we don't know

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.753 align:middle line:90%
how to talk to our own brain.

00:39:21.753 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
We have a part of
our brain that's

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:84%
totally in charge
of how fat or thin

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:84%
we are, does not understand
the stresses of our life.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.622 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
how to talk to it.

00:39:29.622 --> 00:39:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But how do you talk
to someone that

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.482 align:middle line:90%
doesn't speak your language?

00:39:33.482 --> 00:39:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you're in
a foreign country

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.315 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
go to the toilet,

00:39:36.315 --> 00:39:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and no one speaks your language.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask
1,000 people, where's

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:84%
the toilet, where's the
toilet, where's the toilet,

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:90%
nobody will help you.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:47.610 align:middle line:84%
The second you take maybe a
napkin and draw a bathroom,

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:51.470 align:middle line:84%
a picture of a toilet, anyone
can help you, instantly.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Pictures are the infinite--

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.700 align:middle line:84%
are the universal
language when people

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:90%
don't speak your language.

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Pictures are the way you
communicate with someone that

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.307 align:middle line:90%
doesn't speak your language.

00:40:03.307 --> 00:40:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a brain that's
in total control of how

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:90%
fat or thin we are.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't speak English.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's huge.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:84%
That means that a part of you
that's in total control of you,

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.930 align:middle line:90%
you can't communicate.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you make a visual
image of exactly the way

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:21.000 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to look and
you do it in a place

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.390 align:middle line:84%
where you're calm and quiet
so that you can communicate,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.650 align:middle line:90%
your body understands.

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.605 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.605 --> 00:40:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I was losing
weight, I made a visual image

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:84%
of exactly the way I wanted
to look from the very start.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:84%
People would have
said I was crazy.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.700 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 years later, I
became exactly that image,

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.730 align:middle line:84%
down to the T. I don't
think that's a coincidence.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.470 align:middle line:90%
People use visualization for--

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger
when he was a bodybuilder

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:47.380 align:middle line:90%
used visualization.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Olympic athletes
use visualization.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:84%
You can use visualization
for business, success,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.140 align:middle line:90%
all these types of things.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So I want to do a
visualization with you that

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:84%
does a number of things--
one, makes you feel safer,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.260 align:middle line:84%
reduces stress, helps you
communicate to your body

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:08.498 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need fat anymore,
that you need to be thin,

00:41:08.498 --> 00:41:10.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's getting the
stresses wrong, deals

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.520 align:middle line:84%
with specific emotional
obesity issues,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.310 align:middle line:84%
so that you feel
safer being thin,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:20.640 align:middle line:84%
helps you become
clearer, more focused,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and enables you to also
improve your relationships,

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.710 align:middle line:84%
your financial position, and
helps strengthen your mind,

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and help you achieve
whatever you want.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:35.155 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interested
in joining me,

00:41:35.155 --> 00:41:36.905 align:middle line:84%
I'd ask you just to
stand up for a minute.

00:41:36.905 --> 00:41:45.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And just like this with your
shoulders and left them down.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And go like this with your
shoulders and let them down.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And go like this with your
hands, turned to the right,

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.540 align:middle line:90%
to the right.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Turn to your right.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Go like this on the shoulders
on the person in front of you.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Give them a good rub.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.110 align:middle line:90%
They've been listening all day.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Really rub in.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:90%
That's good, yeah.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.655 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry, you'll get yours.

00:42:10.655 --> 00:42:11.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And go like this, turn to
your left, return the favor.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:23.096 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.096 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:90%
And let's just sit down.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:34.808 align:middle line:90%


00:42:34.808 --> 00:42:36.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's really all you need.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.445 align:middle line:90%
You don't the visualization.

00:42:40.445 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That's really all
you'll need, is

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:84%
just to have someone give you
a good massage every morning.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.160 align:middle line:84%
is something I call
spinning the spine.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.327 align:middle line:90%
I talk about it in the book.

00:42:49.327 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a beam of light going
up your spine to put you

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.440 align:middle line:90%
in a very powerful state.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.077 align:middle line:84%
So if you just imagine--
if you sit up straight

00:42:57.077 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:90%
and close your eyes.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:58.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:02.785 align:middle line:84%
And you can put your hands
together own your legs.

00:43:02.785 --> 00:43:09.000 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] Keep
your tongue lightly

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.194 align:middle line:84%
touching the top of your
mouth and move your mouth just

00:43:12.194 --> 00:43:13.136 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:43:13.136 --> 00:43:24.060 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] And we're
just going to imagine

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:29.820 align:middle line:84%
that there's a ball of light
at the base of your spine,

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.330 align:middle line:90%
like a marble or a golf ball.

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a ball of white lights.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.548 align:middle line:84%
And it's just spinning around
the base of your spine.

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:41.560 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES] [EXHALES]

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And as it's spinning around
the base of your spine,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.770 align:middle line:84%
the base of your
spine is glowing

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.300 align:middle line:90%
with bright white lights.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:57.282 align:middle line:90%


00:43:57.282 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] [EXHALES] And we're
just going to imagine this ball

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of light going up your spine
one vertebrae at a time.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.933 align:middle line:84%
And there's 24
vertebrae in your spine.

00:44:09.933 --> 00:44:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know
exactly where they are.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Just going up one vertebra
to the first vertebra,

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.990 align:middle line:84%
it's winding around
the vertebra.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
that vertebra start

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:26.472 align:middle line:90%
to glow with white lights.

00:44:26.472 --> 00:44:31.895 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
vertebra, second vertebra,

00:44:31.895 --> 00:44:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and the third vertebra, and the
fourth, and the fifth vertebra.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth vertebra
is probably around

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.440 align:middle line:90%
behind your navel.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can just imagine
that those first five

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:51.070 align:middle line:84%
vertebrae are glowing
with bright white light.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's clearing out any
blockages in your vertebrae,

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.060 align:middle line:90%
in your spine.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And this bright white
light goes up some more

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to your sixth vertebra
and the seventh vertebra.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't need to know exactly
where they are, just up a notch.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Eighth vertebra,
it's spinning around.

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:13.135 align:middle line:90%
It's clearing out any blockages.

00:45:13.135 --> 00:45:16.960 align:middle line:90%
It's causing your spine to glow.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The ninth vertebra,
10th vertebra,

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:30.710 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES] 11th vertebra, 12th.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.380 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up to close
to behind your heart.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:41.000 align:middle line:84%
13th, 14th vertebra, probably
right behind your heart.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So your spine from
your heart down

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.530 align:middle line:84%
is glowing with
bright white light.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's like a liquid light.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.000 align:middle line:90%
It's becoming liquid.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.540 align:middle line:90%
15th vertebra, 16th, 17th.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It's probably just at
the base of your spine--

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.080 align:middle line:90%
base of your neck.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So your whole spine
[INHALES] from your neck

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
down is glowing with
bright white light.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.010 align:middle line:90%

[INHALES]

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And this ball of light
goes into your neck,

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:28.280 align:middle line:84%
into your 18th vertebra
and 19th vertebra.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And lines up your neck,
20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd,

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.425 align:middle line:90%
and 24th vertebra.

00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:49.658 align:middle line:84%
So your whole spine is glowing
with bright white light,

00:46:49.658 --> 00:46:52.176 align:middle line:90%
like liquid lights.

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:90%
And it feels really nice.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:56.940 align:middle line:84%
All the energy that goes
up and down the spine

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.800 align:middle line:90%
is moving proper.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything's
flowing in the body.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And this bright white
light goes into your head

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and starts to repair all
the cells in your brain,

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:84%
so that they're communicating
properly and clearing out

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:84%
any blockages, so you can
think clearly and feel clearly.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
communicating properly.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.511 align:middle line:84%
And this white light is
spinning around your brain

00:47:24.511 --> 00:47:27.457 align:middle line:84%
and your head,
energizing and repairing.

00:47:27.457 --> 00:47:33.349 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:43.355 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES] [EXHALES]

00:47:43.355 --> 00:47:45.620 align:middle line:84%

in your forehead now and goes
into your face and your eyes.

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And all the facial muscles

Your face is relaxing.

And if you touch your tongue

you might feel this
bright light going

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:10.225 align:middle line:84%
from the roof of your
mouth into your tongue.

00:48:10.225 --> 00:48:15.453 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel a trickle of

goes into your tongue.

And it goes into your
tongue and into your throat.

And it's energizing
your throat center,

giving you the power to speak

down into your heart

00:48:56.805 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And as your heart is glowing

it's energizing your blood.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So your blood becomes like
a silver bright white light

that's traveling through your

and energizing
all of your cells.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So as this bright light travels
through your bloodstream,

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.474 align:middle line:84%
all of your cells start to glow
with the bright white lights.

00:49:22.474 --> 00:49:31.320 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] [EXHALES] So your

bright white lights.

[INHALES] [EXHALES]
And as your body,

every cell in your body now
is growing with bright white

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:49.660 align:middle line:84%
light, just imagine that
every cell in your body says

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:59.520 align:middle line:84%
at the same time in unison,
safe, safe, I am safe,

I am safe, I am safe.

00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And let your body let go of
anything it's holding onto.

I forgive, I forgive,

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
imagine that there's

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.500 align:middle line:84%
a column of bright white
light coming from the ceiling

and wrapping around you, so that
you'd have a feeling of safety,

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.135 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even some
beautiful white wings

00:50:46.135 --> 00:50:52.670 align:middle line:84%
of an angel wrapping around your
body, so that you feel safe.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.490 align:middle line:90%
You feel protected.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.290 align:middle line:90%
You feel nurtured.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:51:07.290 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd like you to imagine
that this ball of white light

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:14.168 align:middle line:84%
goes into your navel and starts
circulating around your navel.

00:51:14.168 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And as it's circulating
around your navel,

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:32.220 align:middle line:84%
it becomes like a
whirlpool or a vortex,

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes like a
whirlpool or a vortex.

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's sucking all the energy
into it from all over your body

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.690 align:middle line:90%
into this whirlpool or vortex.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine that
any excess weight you have

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:51.470 align:middle line:84%
on your body also
becomes like a liquid,

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.780 align:middle line:90%
like a liquid white light.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Any extra fat on your body
becomes a liquid white light.

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to be
sucked into this vortex.

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So any extra weight
that you have

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.560 align:middle line:84%
is being sucked
into this vortex,

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:90%
never to be heard from again.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So as you're sitting
there, the weight

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.590 align:middle line:84%
is just dissolving
all of you, being

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:17.300 align:middle line:84%
sucked into a whirlpool
in your navel,

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:20.430 align:middle line:84%
so that no excess
weight is on your body.

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
column of light

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:24.710 align:middle line:84%
from the sky protecting you,
or these angel wings protecting

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:25.510 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't need the
weight anymore.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.520 align:middle line:90%
You have protection.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.947 align:middle line:84%
You are safe, and you feel safe
at every level of your being.

00:52:33.947 --> 00:52:35.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't need the weight.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're sitting
there with no excess weight

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:44.430 align:middle line:90%
on your body.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:84%
All the excess weight has just
been sucked into your navel,

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.230 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:55.697 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to imagine that
in your mind's eye you get up

00:52:55.697 --> 00:52:57.030 align:middle line:90%
and you're walking on the beach.

00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:58.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful sunny day.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.132 align:middle line:84%
And you're in your
perfect ideal shape,

00:53:00.132 --> 00:53:01.590 align:middle line:84%
because all the
weight's gone, it's

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:03.990 align:middle line:84%
all been sucked into your
navel through this vortex.

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.520 align:middle line:90%
And you're at the beach.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.505 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
sun on your skin.

00:53:10.505 --> 00:53:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you put
some lotion on.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel that your skin
is tanned and toned and tight.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.480 align:middle line:90%
And your stomach is flat.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
definition in your muscles,

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.238 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you wants.

00:53:22.238 --> 00:53:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're walking on
the beach, and you're

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:27.420 align:middle line:84%
in your most
perfect ideal shape.

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.130 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You have a body
that's thin and light.

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the
cool water on your feet

00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:41.220 align:middle line:84%
from the ocean and the
warm sun on your shoulders.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel the
breeze in your hair

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and the smell of
sand and coconut oil.

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And it feels so nice.

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're walking
a little bit faster.

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:57.875 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, because
you have so much energy,

00:53:57.875 --> 00:54:00.520 align:middle line:90%
you start to run.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're running on the beach,
just because you can, maybe

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.370 align:middle line:90%
like you've never run before.

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:06.495 align:middle line:84%
And you're running quicker
and quicker and quicker.

00:54:06.495 --> 00:54:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And you're kicking up water
and splashing as you run.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
turn toward the water,

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.060 align:middle line:84%
you jump over a wave, and
you dive in the water.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And you feel the cool refreshing
water on your shoulders.

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:90%
And it feels so good.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:90%
And you jump up in the air.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And you feel alive.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like
this is me, this

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:26.225 align:middle line:84%
is my most perfect
natural state.

00:54:26.225 --> 00:54:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.700 align:middle line:90%
And you feel safe and protected.

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can let
go of the weight.

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.078 align:middle line:90%
You don't need it anymore.

00:54:43.078 --> 00:54:46.330 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES] [EXHALES]

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And then just imagine
now that you're

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.100 align:middle line:90%
sitting back in the room.

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And you've taken that
experience with you.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:59.440 align:middle line:90%
Your skin feels amazing.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.860 align:middle line:90%
And you're toned and tight.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And you're in your
perfect ideal shape.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to imagine
what your life's going

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to be like over the
next couple of days,

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.600 align:middle line:84%
how people are going to notice
how much vibrance you have.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel that
protection around here.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.267 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's these huge beautiful
angel wings protecting you.

00:55:21.267 --> 00:55:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's a
column of light coming

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:27.020 align:middle line:84%
from the sky that impenetrable
and protecting you.

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can notice how
your life is flowing.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Your family life, any business
meetings that you have,

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.540 align:middle line:90%
everything is starting to flow.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And maybe how in
six months from now,

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.400 align:middle line:84%
you're doing exactly what
you're meant to be doing.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And you've got so much energy.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And you're light and fit.

00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:41.950 align:middle line:90%
And people are amazed.

00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
in a presentation

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:48.340 align:middle line:84%
or at work in a meeting, and
you've got so much energy

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.140 align:middle line:90%
coming out of you.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And people are spellbound by
your power, and your beauty,

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and your energy, and your
vibrance, and how fit you are.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.420 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And so life and your
career is flowing.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.140 align:middle line:84%
People only want to
do business with you.

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And family life,
your relationships

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:07.220 align:middle line:84%
with your loved ones are
all beautiful and flowing

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and your kids.

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And you've got energy to
run and play with your kids.

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.240 align:middle line:90%


00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
your life is fine.

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:20.993 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.993 --> 00:56:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
take this image of you

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.260 align:middle line:84%
six months down the road, or in
your most perfect ideal shape,

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in your most perfect
career, incredibly

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:33.670 align:middle line:84%
successful, happy,
flowy, fit, vibrant.

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:37.412 align:middle line:84%
Everything in your life
is exactly what you want.

00:56:37.412 --> 00:56:38.620 align:middle line:90%
I want you to see that image.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.340 align:middle line:90%


00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And let that image be programmed
into every cell of your body.

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Imagine every cell of your body
having that image and it going

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.180 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA of your body.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.255 align:middle line:84%
So you're programming
yourself and your DNA

00:56:56.255 --> 00:56:57.130 align:middle line:90%
to become this image.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to imagine that,
as you go to sleep at night,

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:07.610 align:middle line:90%
you have this image of you--

00:57:07.610 --> 00:57:13.470 align:middle line:84%
safe, flowing, protected, fit,
vibrant, successful, happy--

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and that that image
is like a magnet.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's pulling you,
so that every decision

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:22.280 align:middle line:84%
you make from here on in,
whether you turn left or right

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.250 align:middle line:84%
or talk to this person or
that person, everything that's

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.710 align:middle line:84%
happening in your life
happens because you're

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:32.420 align:middle line:84%
being guided to your most
perfect, ideal, body, life,

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.880 align:middle line:90%
shape, existence in every way.

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:41.070 align:middle line:90%


00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:45.074 align:middle line:84%
And you feel that at
every cell of your body.

00:57:45.074 --> 00:57:48.962 align:middle line:84%
And you can release the fear,
because you are now protected.

00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:54.794 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.794 --> 00:57:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling
that feeling as you're

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:59.070 align:middle line:84%
sitting here in your
most perfect ideal shape.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:10.914 align:middle line:84%
In your own time and space,
you can open your eyes

00:58:10.914 --> 00:58:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and know that forever
you're being guided now

00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:22.870 align:middle line:84%
to the most perfect ideal
life and fitness and existence

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.140 align:middle line:90%
that you can possibly express.

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:30.428 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.428 --> 00:58:51.790 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] [EXHALES]
[INHALES] [EXHALES]

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.424 align:middle line:90%
Anybody feel any different?

00:58:53.424 --> 00:58:56.150 align:middle line:90%


00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I think there's-- personally,
I think there's no limit

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to what's possible
through visualization.

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do
visualizations like this,

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:08.180 align:middle line:84%
the more powerful your mind
becomes and the more able

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.280 align:middle line:90%
you are to get into that state.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like a muscle that
you train everyday,

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.960 align:middle line:84%
until you have the power to
literally create anything

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.593 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:59:16.593 --> 00:59:17.510 align:middle line:90%
I really believe that.

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.340 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen that in my life.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.670 align:middle line:84%
But even if I'm wrong about
all of that, at the very least,

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:30.650 align:middle line:84%
you cannot deny that
you feel less stressful.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And simply feeling
less stressful

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.540 align:middle line:90%
will enable you to lose weight.

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.687 align:middle line:84%
So your downside is
that you'll lose weight.

00:59:37.687 --> 00:59:39.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Your upside is that
you will totally

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.280 align:middle line:84%
transform every aspect
of your existence,

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and have the power to do so, and
achieve amazing things in life.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.865 align:middle line:90%
There is no limit.

00:59:47.865 --> 00:59:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sure of that.

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.360 align:middle line:84%
We'll take a break for lunch
for an hour, I guess till 2:45.

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.080 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.150 align:middle line:90%
So just an hour lunch.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back, I have
a milkshake waiting for you.

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:06.292 align:middle line:90%
So don't eat too much.

01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about how
to apply this to kids.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.667 align:middle line:84%
And we'll also put
it all together

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and answer any
questions you have.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.120 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy your lunch.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:12.991 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:00:12.991 --> 01:00:15.396 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:19.725 align:middle line:90%


01:00:19.725 --> 01:00:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm finding this
a real revelation.

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if I haven't
heard a lot of this before,

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.080 align:middle line:84%
but I think I'm
finally hearing it.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And he has a marvelous
way of actually presenting

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:31.292 align:middle line:90%
the information.

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of
meditation in my life,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and I do it on a daily basis.

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:37.590 align:middle line:84%
But the meditation I just had
was absolutely miraculous.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And especially the imagery
of the angel wings, I

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
find really just a true
revelation to myself.

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So this has been a
fantastic session.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.055 align:middle line:84%
>> The meditation,
visualization, yeah.

01:00:49.055 --> 01:00:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It's unreal.

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I got very emotional.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I just now was touching
my buttons and my cells.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like,
this is going to work.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.000 align:middle line:90%
