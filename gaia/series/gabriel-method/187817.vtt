00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:16.149 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Good morning, everybody,
and welcome to the Crown Towers

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Palladium Ballroom.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
It's good to see you here
today for the Gabriel Method.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:90%
My name is Jack Strom.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.580 align:middle line:90%
I help Jon arrange the seminars.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
If you have any questions
or problems during the day,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:84%
please do not hesitate
to contact me.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
So without any
further ado, I'd like

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
to introduce a man who lost
103 kilos without dieting,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
has changed the lives of
hundreds of thousands of people

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
around the world, has written a
bestselling book, which is now

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
being translated into 15
languages, and as I said,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
has become an
international bestseller.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And apart from
that, he has totally

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:90%
transformed his own body.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Would you please welcome
to the stage, Jon Gabriel?

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.394 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for all coming.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This is our biggest
seminar ever.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I started doing this about
three years ago in my house

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
with 20 people doing
a one-day seminar.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And then about two years ago, we
started taking it on the road,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and we did a seminar for
about 100 people in Brisbane

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:90%
in a church.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty
amazed with that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And now, we've got a room
with 450 people in it.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty amazing.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And the message that I have
is a very different message

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
to anything I've ever seen
that's out there in terms

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:90%
of weight loss.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Every diet program approach
I've ever seen in weight loss

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
all functions on a basic
paradigm that you can somehow

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:84%
force yourself to lose weight,
either through willpower,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
just gutting it out,
some sort of program

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
with a eat whatever you want
once a day, or once a week,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is-- it's
just always a program.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, you can manage
yourself, maintain yourself

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
through behavior
modification, somehow force

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
yourself to lose weight and
keep it off in the long term.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
been my experience.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
My experience is that
when your body wants

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
to be fat for
whatever reason, it's

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
going to force you
to gain weight.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to fight it,
it's going to fight back.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can control what
you eat in the short term.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.862 align:middle line:84%
But you can't control
how hungry you are.

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:38.662 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can't control the
types of foods you're craving.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And if your body
wants to be fat,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.833 align:middle line:84%
it will make you insatiably
hungry for the most

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:50.875 align:middle line:90%
fattening foods possible.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But my approach
is very different.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
My approach functions on a
very different basic paradigm.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is that if you can get
your body to want to be thin,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.673 align:middle line:84%
then it all happens
automatically.

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no more
managing yourself.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
There's no more
maintenance schedule.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no more
counting calories.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
There's no more good
days and bad days.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:90%
You simply crave less food.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:90%
You crave healthier food.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Your metabolism
actually speeds up,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and you become more
efficient at burning fat.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And so it all happens
automatically.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And then once the
weight's off, there's

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.312 align:middle line:84%
no more maintenance schedule
that you have to worry about.

00:03:34.312 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's no worrying
about keeping it off forever,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.478 align:middle line:84%
because you weren't
dieting in the first place.

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
You simply worked with
your body and your body's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
basic principles to get
it to want to be thin.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.747 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And the message has spread
all over the world now.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
As Jack said, the book's being
translated into 15 languages.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And next week, we launch our
Spanish website, El Metado

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a million others
that I can't even pronounce

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:90%
in different languages.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to take
it all over the world now.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why it's spreading

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
is because people know
that diets don't work.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%
People have tried it.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
If diets worked,
there'd be one diet.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.715 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would lose weight,
and that would be the end of it.

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
There wouldn't be
1,000 diets out there

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
and a new diet every week, the
avocado diet, the soup diet,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
the chicken diet, the doctor
this diet, the once a week

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
diet-- whatever it is,
there'd be one diet.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Everybody would lose weight,
and that would be the end of it.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Diets don't work.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going explain to you
exactly why diets don't work--

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
chemically, physically,
theoretically,

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:90%
exactly why diets don't work.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And why every time
you go on a diet,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.775 align:middle line:84%
you lose weight
in the short term

00:05:02.775 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
these cravings,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:90%
and then you have this yo-yo.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And so people that have been
yo-yo dieting for 30 years

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.413 align:middle line:84%
are now contacting, me
thousands of people,

00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and saying that they're
finally losing weight,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.027 align:middle line:90%
and they're not dieting.

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they're
working with their body

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:90%
rather than fighting it.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I always say that dieting
is a little bit like holding

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
a volleyball under water,
because the second you let go,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.302 align:middle line:90%
poof, it pops right up.

00:05:32.302 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%
This is very different.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on
my own experience.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just tell you
a little bit about that.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1990, I
moved to New York,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and I started working
on Wall Street.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And back then, I was pretty
much exactly the way I am now.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.047 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty much one of
those naturally thin people.

00:05:50.047 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
You know the types we
all hate that can just

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
eat whatever they want and just
never have to think about it?

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:90%
I was like that.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.377 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
think about weight.

00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I moved to New
York, and I started

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
working in a high stress
job on Wall Street.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I was making $300 a week as
a bond trading assistant.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And my rent was $400 a week.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a pretty stressful job.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I moved to New
York, I started gaining weight.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think too much
about it in the beginning.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
I gained maybe five
kilos, or 10 pounds

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning in the first
year and maybe another five

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
kilos, or 10 pounds
in the second year.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And everybody gains weight
when they start a job.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
sitting in an office,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.507 align:middle line:84%
you're working at a
computer, you're not

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
thinking about
what you're eating,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.562 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't think
too much about it.

00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But after a couple of
years, I just kept gaining.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't stop.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, after
a couple of years,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I was about 100
kilos, or 220 pounds.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
I was going to try

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
to do something about it, and
I did what everybody does.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.182 align:middle line:90%
I went on a diet.

00:06:54.182 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it just
makes sense, right?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Calories in.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Calories out.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Just cut the calories.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:90%
So I went on a diet.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I went
on a lot of diets.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And every diet or program I went
on all had the same pattern.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:84%
There'd be a whole list of
things I can't have, right?

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
No wheat, no fat,
no sugar, no salt.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, I'd follow
the diet to the letter,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because I am a fairly
disciplined person.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd follow the
diet to the letter.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd lose weight, which
you can do, right?

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:90%
You can lose weight on a diet.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:90%
And I did lose weight.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd lose maybe 10
pounds, or five kilos.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen is, after
about two weeks or three weeks

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
of hard work, and I'm
feeling good about myself,

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and I've lost the weight--

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm still on the diet, and
I'm not losing weight anymore.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you've
ever had this experience, where

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:84%
you're dieting and you're just
not losing weight anymore.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fighting
cravings left and right.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And the smell of
pizza in New York

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
is at every single
street corner.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And nobody makes pizza
like New Yorkers.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the best pizza
in the universe.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:90%
It's this thin crust.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a big piece.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:90%
They're like $1.50 a slice.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
They sit out on the
lights waiting for you.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.768 align:middle line:84%
And there's smell at
every single corner.

00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:15.685 align:middle line:84%
And there's this kind
of science to it, right?

00:08:15.685 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to get the pizza
when it's right out the oven,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.722 align:middle line:90%
because the crust is too soft.

00:08:18.722 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
You want it to sit under the
lights for about an hour, hour

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and a half.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:90%
And it gets real crispy.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.805 align:middle line:84%
If it sits too long,
it gets too crumbly.

00:08:24.805 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And you just know it.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Like as soon as you a
pizza, you know exactly--

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:90%
that's 20 minutes.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.770 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Not that slice.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:90%
No, that slice.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.263 align:middle line:90%
That's an hour and a half slice.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
So the smell of pizza would be
at every single street corner.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.582 align:middle line:84%
And then, I just
couldn't take it anymore.

00:08:39.582 --> 00:08:40.624 align:middle line:90%
And I had this big binge.

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you've
ever had these big binges,

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.690 align:middle line:84%
but I used to have
these big binges.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, like all the
weight, whatever I lost,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
five kilos, 10 kilos, whatever
it was, it would come back,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.402 align:middle line:90%
poof, like that in two days.

00:08:57.402 --> 00:08:59.735 align:middle line:84%
And then two days later, I'd
be heavier than when I even

00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:00.535 align:middle line:90%
started the diet.

00:09:00.535 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And I remember those binges.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I remember I once had--

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
when I was having one
of those bad days,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.653 align:middle line:84%
those binges where I
couldn't take anymore--

00:09:11.653 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I once had three
delivery people show up

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.940 align:middle line:84%
at my door at the same time,
all waiting for me to pay.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So here, I'm this
big guy, right?

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I open the door.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
There's three-- there's a
pizza guy, there's Chinese,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and McDonald's
delivers in New York.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:84%
You can get anything
you want in New York.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.023 align:middle line:84%
So there's three guys
waiting for me to pay.

00:09:30.023 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So I try to make it off like
there's a party going on.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Like, hold on guys.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right there.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:90%
How much is this?

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But I'd have this big binge,
and then, poof, all this weight

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:90%
would come back, just like that.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it was.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:90%
Five kilos, 10 kilos, boom.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Right back.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And then two days
later, three days later,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.578 align:middle line:84%
I'm five kilos heavier than
when I'd even started the diet.

00:09:56.578 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And this went on and
on and on and on.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Lose 10 kilos, gain 10.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Lose 10 kilos, gain 15.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
It would go on and on and
on and on for like 11 years.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I
tried everything,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean I really,
really worked hard.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I used to work face to
face with Dr. Atkins.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:84%
You know Dr. Atkins
from the Atkins diet?

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:90%
The no carb diet?

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Who can go forever
without carbs, you know?

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But I worked face to face
with him for a month.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.208 align:middle line:90%
I spent over $3,000 with him.

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And every Monday morning,
I'd go into his office.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:90%
And he was an angry old man.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I got to say.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:90%
I did not like Dr. Atkins.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm going on the
record and saying,

00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:90%
I did not like Dr. Atkins.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting in his
office, and he's

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
got this big, mahogany desk
and this big grandfather clock

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.762 align:middle line:90%
that's going tick, tick, tick.

00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there kind
of looking down like this,

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.428 align:middle line:84%
and he's looking
at my test scores.

00:10:54.428 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'm borderline type two
diabetic and metabolic syndrome

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and triglycerides through the
roof and high blood pressure,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:90%
He just looks up at me.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.228 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sort of
looking down like that,

00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:06.645 align:middle line:84%
because I haven't
lost any weight.

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
He just looks up me and
goes, what are you doing?

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.230 align:middle line:90%
You're killing yourself.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.885 align:middle line:84%
And I think to myself, is that
really the best you can do?

00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're Dr.
Atkins, and you've

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
sold 200 million
copies of your book.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.935 align:middle line:84%
And the best you can do is
yell at me for being so fat?

00:11:26.935 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm going to lose weight
because you're mad at me?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough motivation?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've got
fitness trainers 7:00

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:84%
in the morning I'm
meeting with, and I'm

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.645 align:middle line:90%
going all day without carbs.

00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, I went to
the Pritikin Institute

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.720 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Monica, California.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:90%
You know, the Pritikin diet?

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.538 align:middle line:84%
Spent two weeks there and I
don't know, maybe $10,000.

00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's the exact
opposite, right?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the zero fat diet.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.218 align:middle line:90%
That's the all carb diet.

00:12:02.218 --> 00:12:03.018 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:03.018 --> 00:12:05.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And so one week I'm
on the Atkins diet,

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and I go into McDonald's and
I order a quarter pounder.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And I take the bread off.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:90%
I just eat the burger.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And the next week, I'm
on the Pritikin diet.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I go to the same
McDonald's, order

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the same quarter
pounder with cheese,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and this time I'm eating
the bread and not the meat.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't just eat a burger.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And my wife at the
time used to joke to me

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that I was on the Atkins diet
during the day and the Pritikin

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
diet at night.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I by the end of the
day, who could go without carbs?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.320 align:middle line:90%
So I jumped ship.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work, by the way.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:10%
I don't recommend that one.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a recipe for disaster.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:90%
But I did that.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And I had fitness trainers.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I had homeopaths.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Doctors.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I did acupuncture.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever done
acupuncture for weight loss?

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, there's
an acupressure point

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
right here on your ear.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And I had seeds taped to my ear.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is,
whenever you're hungry,

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to kind
of rub these seeds,

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.585 align:middle line:84%
and it makes your
hunger go away.

00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm walking down the streets
of New York passing the pizza

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
places sitting there going
like this rubbing the seeds.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
They think I'm some sort of FBI
surveillance agent, you know?

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.773 align:middle line:84%
Like, he's taking the
pizza out of the oven.

00:13:30.773 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Looks like it's going
to be a pepperoni.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.918 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm doing
all these things,

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and they all work
in the short term.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.683 align:middle line:90%
And then, I'd bounce back.

00:13:38.683 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And it just kept going and going
and going and going like that.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And this went on until
I gained over 100 kilos.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Lose five kilos, gain 10 kilos,
lose five kilos, gain 10 kilos.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I looked
something like that.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:90%
That was me in 2001.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.645 align:middle line:84%
And I had a turning
point back then,

00:14:05.645 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
about a month
after that picture.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was driving home
from a movie in New Jersey,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.752 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking
about the last 11 years.

00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about,
no matter what I did,

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.627 align:middle line:90%
I kept gaining weight.

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And what was
interesting for me is

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
that there was a time that
it wasn't an issue at all.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
that I never had

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.610 align:middle line:90%
to think about weight at all.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, no matter what I'm
doing, I'm gaining weight.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really, really
trying to lose weight.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's this
common stereotype

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.817 align:middle line:84%
that overweight people are just
weak or lazy or overindulgent,

00:14:52.817 --> 00:14:54.025 align:middle line:90%
or they should just eat less.

00:14:54.025 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I've lived
through that, and if I

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.740 align:middle line:84%
have one message to the
world, weight loss is not

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:90%
about discipline or willpower.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And gaining weight is not
because you're weak or lazy.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a legitimate
thing that happens

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
in your body, a switch
that turns on that puts you

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:90%
into a fat gaining mode.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And when that switch
is on, your body

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
gets transformed into
a fat storage machine.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.520 align:middle line:90%
It's very physical and chemical.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the number one
expert, the most world renowned

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.035 align:middle line:90%
biochemical expert--

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
his name is Dr.
Jeffrey Friedman.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.705 align:middle line:84%
He's been termed
the Father of Fat.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not the most exciting
term in the world,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.575 align:middle line:90%
I don't think really.

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I think he deserves better
than that quite frankly.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, discoverer
of the hormone leptin,

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:84%
which is the most important
hormone as far as weight loss

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and controlling
your body weight--

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.762 align:middle line:84%
has said that obesity
is not about willpower,

00:15:58.762 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and losing weight is
not about willpower.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
stop blaming people.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And modern conventional
wisdom or medical wisdom

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:90%
doesn't understand that yet.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I am on a big crusade
right now, and I'm

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
getting lots and lots
of positive feedback

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:90%
from the medical community.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I've just been asked to do a
continuing education course

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:90%
for doctors in the states.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
There's been a doctor at
the University of Idaho

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
who gave a course to
the faculty and staff

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
at the medical
school, the Gabriel

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.387 align:middle line:90%
Method of Weight Reduction.

00:16:33.387 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've also been
asked just recently

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to go speak again at the
American Holistic Medical

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So doctors are starting
to recognize this

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:84%
that chemically, physically,
when your body wants to be fat,

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
it will force you
to gain weight.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Several things happen.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Number one, your brain stops
listening to your stomach

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:90%
when your body wants to be fat.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Which means that you
can eat and eat and eat,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and the only way you're
going to stop eating

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is if your stomach can't
handle anymore food.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
was in that situation

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.539 align:middle line:84%
that every time after
every meal, I was just--

00:17:07.539 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I was bloated.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.055 align:middle line:90%
I was stuffed.

00:17:10.055 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
ever had that feeling.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
But that's because your
brain is intentionally not

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:90%
listening to your stomach.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It wants you to eat
as much as possible

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:90%
when your fat switch is on.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Your tongue loses its
sensitivity to sweet foods,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
so it causes you to
crave sweeter foods.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
Your metabolism slows
down, and your body

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:90%
goes into fat storage mode.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:84%
When you combine
all these things

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in a world of excess,
unlimited empty carbs

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and nutritionally barren food,
it's a recipe for disaster.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happening.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.015 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
you're weak or lazy.

00:17:41.015 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And the same part of the
brain that controls hunger

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
controls how much sleep we need
and how much oxygen we need.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you
went to your doctor

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and he said, you
know, your problem is

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%
just you sleep too much.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Just sleep less.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:84%
You could do that for
a while, couldn't you?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.922 align:middle line:84%
He says, just sleep
two hours a day.

00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And the whole world judged
you, because you were lazy

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
because you slept
seven hours a day.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.087 align:middle line:90%
Just sleep two hours a day.

00:18:11.087 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:90%
So you could do that for awhile.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You could do it
for a week, maybe.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:10%
10 days at the most.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:90%
But then what would happen?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Your body would
force you to sleep,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
because it has the
ability to do that.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you tried to hold
your breath long enough,

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
your body would
force you to breathe.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with food.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Your body has the
ability to force

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:90%
you to eat sooner or later.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.797 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.797 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you
go to your doctor

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and he tells you to
eat less, you can just

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:90%
tell him to breathe less.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
exact same thing.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.577 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happening.

00:18:55.577 --> 00:18:57.785 align:middle line:84%
People are saying eat less
when they don't understand

00:18:57.785 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that your body is
forcing you to eat,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and I have lived through it.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And now, I've been on
the other side of it.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's been six,
almost seven years.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I never think about dieting.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Not once.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.450 align:middle line:84%
People that are around me
are amazed at how much I eat.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.325 align:middle line:90%
And you can ask them.

00:19:13.325 --> 00:19:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Jackson around here and
everyone that we sit with,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I eat what I want.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.555 align:middle line:84%
I do eat a very healthy
diet, but I never

00:19:18.555 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:90%
have to think about weight.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
There's never a time I say I'm
not going to have something.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Not in seven years, almost.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.893 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
issue's been dealt with.

00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
My body's no longer
forcing me to gain weight.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So yes, so I had the
turning point back in 2001.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And I spent a lot of time
doing research on the internet.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
What I decided was, I decided I
was never going to diet again.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.395 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.395 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Because what's the
point if your body's

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.783 align:middle line:90%
forcing you to gain weight?

00:19:53.783 --> 00:19:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I decided,
rather than diet, I

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.260 align:middle line:84%
was going to try to figure
out why my body wanted

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to be a fat in the
first place and what

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I could do to get it
to want to be thin.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very solid
biochemistry background

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
from the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and that gave me
enough of a foundation

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to do the research
on the internet.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And I spent hours and hours
a day studying biochemistry.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I discovered
this fat switch that we have,

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:90%
or what I call the fat programs.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And I put together
an approach for me

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
that worked at dealing with
my issues that were activating

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:90%
my fat programs.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:90%
And I started to lose weight.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is,
I didn't lose weight quickly

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like a diet, where
you lose 20 kilos in 20 days

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and then you had this
big old rebound thing.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I lost weight slowly
in the beginning.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I lost about 25 kilos
over a six month period.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a kilo
a week or something.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you're over 180
kilos or over 400 pounds,

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:90%
that's not setting any records.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to get
you on Biggest Loser.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If I'd ever want to
be on Biggest Loser.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is, I wasn't dieting.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I was making sure that I
was nourishing my body,

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and I was dealing with
the stresses in my life

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that were activating
my fat programs.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
become less hungry.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:90%
But I still craved chocolate.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:20.252 align:middle line:90%
I still craved junk food.

00:21:20.252 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And whenever I wanted--

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.418 align:middle line:84%
I used to keep these chocolate
almonds in the fridge.

00:21:23.418 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I wanted
one, I'd just have one.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
There was no hesitation.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Not the slightest hesitation.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Before, there was always
a good day and a bad day.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.035 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if
you've ever lived this,

00:21:33.035 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
but people live
their whole lives

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
where every single day is
a good day and a bad day.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a battle from
the moment you get up.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Today, you wake up and it's
going to be a good day.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
your fruit juice,

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.090 align:middle line:84%
and you have your Weetabix, or
you have your whatever it is.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And then around 11:00, you get
these cravings for chocolate

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.542 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is, or a donut.

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And today's a good day.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to do that.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And you gut it out.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to
lunch, and you're OK.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And it then by the time
it's 4:00, you're exhausted,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.530 align:middle line:90%
and somebody yelled at you.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, oh, screw it.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.955 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it's a bad day.

00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And you go to the store,
and you buy all the things

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that you've been staring
at for the last two weeks.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.590 align:middle line:90%
You take it home.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know,
it's 2:00 in the morning,

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and there's pizza
containers on the floor,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and your hands are orange
from cheese twists,

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and you've got cupcake
wrappers everywhere.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Bad day.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:90%
And then, you start again.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow, OK.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:90%
We're going to start fresh.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.453 align:middle line:90%
So I lived this way.

00:22:26.453 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Every day was a
good day and bad--

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:90%
I stopped that.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
There was no more good
days, no more bad days.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.697 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted a piece of
chocolate, I'd have it.

00:22:32.697 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'd keep walking.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.342 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, it's
chemicals in, chemicals out.

00:22:36.342 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted another
one, I'd take it.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But I made sure I
nourished my body.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And I made sure I dealt with the
stresses that were activating

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:90%
the fat programs.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And the weight
started to come off.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But what was interesting
is, after about six months,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
rather than have that
plateau, the weight

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:90%
actually came off faster.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered there's
a reason for that.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when your body
actually wants to be thin--

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.068 align:middle line:84%
that is not when you force
yourself to lose weight,

00:23:02.068 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
but when you actually get
your body to want to be thin,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very
efficient at burning fat.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.967 align:middle line:84%
You become more of a
fat burning machine,

00:23:11.967 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and you can lose weight
quicker and quicker.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Right up to the end,
I was losing weight

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
at maybe two or
three kilos a day.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Those last couple of
kilos, the last 10

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
kilos that most people say
are impossible to lose,

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
when you lose that much
weight, it flew off me.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
My body just didn't
want the weight anymore.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:90%
The issues were done.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.160 align:middle line:90%
The problem was resolved.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.080 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.890 align:middle line:90%
End of story.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And when your body
wants to be thin,

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
it becomes very
efficient at burning fat.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole time I was
doing this, I was taking notes.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I was writing.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was never a
writer, by the way.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:90%
I always hated writing.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Like at uni-- I spent
five years at uni,

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and I took everything
from biochemistry

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to economics to photography.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.870 align:middle line:90%
It didn't matter.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:90%
I'd take any course.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:84%
My only criteria
was that I wouldn't

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:90%
have to write anything.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I only had to
take two courses

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.730 align:middle line:90%
where I had to write a paper.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:90%
One was English.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I had to take a
semester of English.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other was
a management course

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
that was supposed to
be a guaranteed A.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only
person I have ever heard

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:90%
of that got a B in that class.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.257 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't like writing.

00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
what would happen

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.920 align:middle line:84%
is, I used to sit every
morning, I'd do this meditation.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'd get to a certain
point of the meditation,

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:90%
and then, boom.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
In an instant, all
of this information

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:30.920 align:middle line:90%
would come out of me.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Like boom.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.592 align:middle line:84%
I'd get all this
information, and I'd

00:24:33.592 --> 00:24:34.748 align:middle line:90%
write for like 30 pages.

00:24:34.748 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'd sit
and meditate again.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd get to a certain
point, and boom,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.850 align:middle line:90%
I'd get all this information.

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
I'd start writing and
writing and writing.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had this 60 or 90 pages
of stuff, of information.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.867 align:middle line:10%
And then, I transcribed it
on the computer, information

00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:50.450 align:middle line:10%
about weight loss, about the way
the body works, the mind body

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:10%
connection, visualizations.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:10%
I had this big old
document I used

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:10%
to call Weight Loss and
the Meaning of Life.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
millions of words.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And after I lost the way,
I sort of put it together.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:90%
What is it that I'm saying?

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And I put together all
the different categories

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
of the approach.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And after that, also, I
was on TV very quickly.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
I sent my before and after
pictures to The Today Show,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:90%
you know, Today Tonight.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I emailed it to them.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.995 align:middle line:84%
And 10 minutes later,
they called me.

00:25:25.995 --> 00:25:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe in a couple
of months, they'd call.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes later, they call me.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.825 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking to them.

00:25:30.825 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:90%
And they say, that's great.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right there.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, you'll be right where?

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.642 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're coming
over to your house.

00:25:37.642 --> 00:25:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, I live in Denmark,
Western Australia.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm 500 kilometers
south of Perth.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.815 align:middle line:90%
They said, that's all right.

00:25:42.815 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:90%
We have a helicopter.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.607 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be there
in an hour and a half.

00:25:45.607 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.220 align:middle line:90%
I had to go tell my wife--

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:90%
I had a little two-year-old kid.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:90%
The house is a mess.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
kid, you're not--

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.303 align:middle line:84%
my wife was a very
private person.

00:25:56.303 --> 00:25:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I had to tell her that
there was a national film

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.355 align:middle line:84%
crew coming in an hour
and a half to talk to us.

00:26:01.355 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
It took me an hour
and 15 minutes

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.860 align:middle line:84%
to convince her that I
wasn't lying, in which case,

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.660 align:middle line:90%
she said, right.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:90%
Left.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Left me with this big old mess.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there taking
clothes and putting them

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
in the washing machine,
hiding them anywhere

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.973 align:middle line:84%
I can, just to kind
of create a place.

00:26:15.973 --> 00:26:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And then they come over, and
we do all this big old thing.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.848 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing I know, I'm

00:26:19.848 --> 00:26:21.952 align:middle line:84%
getting calls from
people all over.

00:26:21.952 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing patterns
that are similar,

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and I'm working with them.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing a lot of
things that I had but then

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things that I
didn't have but still

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
apply to the basic principles
of what's causing your body

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:90%
to want to be fat or thin.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I systematized it
and put it together

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.215 align:middle line:84%
in an approach that
applies to everybody.

00:26:41.215 --> 00:26:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we're going
to be talking about today.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.757 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about how to get your body

00:26:45.757 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to want to be thin, how to
resolve the issue forever,

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:84%
how to have an approach so
that when you walk out of here,

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to know exactly
what you need to do to resolve

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.970 align:middle line:90%
the issue forever.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.387 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it won't
happen immediately.

00:26:57.387 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:90%
For some people it will.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.393 align:middle line:84%
But you will know how
to resolve the issue.

00:27:04.393 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I
want to talk about,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
is why would your body want
to be fat or want to be thin?

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm up
here, and you guys

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.605 align:middle line:84%
are thinking, what's
this guy talking about?

00:27:12.605 --> 00:27:14.230 align:middle line:84%
My body doesn't want
to be fat or thin.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Why would your body want to
be fat or want to be thin?

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.570 align:middle line:84%
If you can get this
concept, everything else

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:22.333 align:middle line:90%
happens by itself.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
is just a question

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
of how do you apply the concept.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.940 align:middle line:90%
But this is the core premise.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get
this, everything else

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.440 align:middle line:90%
fits into place.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the way
your body adapts to stress.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
brilliantly formulated

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to stresses
in our environment.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
a perfect example.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you go out in the
sun, and you get too much sun.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It's real hot.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a stress.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Too much sun is a stress.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, a
stress is anything

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that causes your body
to be alert to the fact

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that there may be
a threat out there.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
The threat could be
a tiger chasing you.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:84%
The threat could be
starving to death.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.457 align:middle line:84%
The threat could be
getting skin cancer.

00:28:17.457 --> 00:28:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the threat
is, that's a stress.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:90%
A stress is like an alarm bell.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.658 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you got
go out in the sun,

00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:90%
and you get too much sun.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.410 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Your skin gets burned,
and then your skin adapts.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The way it adapts
is, it gets darker

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:84%
so that the next time you
go out in the sun, your skin

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is more protected
from the sunlight.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the way our
body adapts to stress.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, not enough sun
is also a stress,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
because your body
needs sunlight.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:90%
It's an essential nutrient.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:84%
It creates essential
nutrients in your body.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.247 align:middle line:90%
Not enough sun is a stress.

00:29:00.247 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the wintertime,
you're not getting enough sun,

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:03.955 align:middle line:90%
the exact opposite happens.

00:29:03.955 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Your skin gets real light
so it can absorb more sun.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
That's how our body
adapts to stresses.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Too much sun is a stress.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.985 align:middle line:90%
Not enough sun is a stress.

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So your body's going to
come up with the right skin

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
tone for whatever
living environment

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.990 align:middle line:84%
you're in to maximize
the benefits of the sun

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and prevent the harmful
side effects of the sun.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:90%
That's how our bodies adapt.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:31.040 align:middle line:10%
And our bodies way
of adapting has

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.830 align:middle line:10%
enabled us to
populate environments

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:10%
all over the world.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's the exact
same with fat.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, right now, how fat or thin
you are doesn't matter at all.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We can have all
the food we need.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't need fat.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason our
bodies would need fat.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time
thousands of years

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
ago when we did need
fat and when having fat

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.630 align:middle line:90%
was crucial to your survival.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was when we were living
outdoors thousands of years

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.100 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Say you're living outdoors,
and it's wintertime.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:84%
It's cold for months
and months and months,

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.977 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing to eat.

00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to eat?

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%
There's fruits.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the lakes are all
iced over so you can't fish.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no salads, nuts, seeds.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:90%
All the animals are hibernating.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's cold out.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
stress on your body.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And that stress causes
a particular type

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.690 align:middle line:90%
of chemistry in your body.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And that chemistry alerts
your body to the fact

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that there's a famine out
there and that it's cold out.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And the way your body adapts is
by getting fatter when it can.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.730 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
you're in that stress

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.487 align:middle line:84%
is your body activates what I
call the fat programs designed

00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:48.570 align:middle line:90%
to help you put on weight.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.057 align:middle line:84%
It's as if your body says,
we're living in a world

00:30:51.057 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:84%
where every once in a
while there's famines,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.740 align:middle line:84%
so we need to carry
extra weight on us.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And your bodies have an ideal
weight of what they want to be.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:90%
It's called a set point.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's say your body
wants to be 80 kilos.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.180 align:middle line:10%
Let's say it wants
to be 80 kilos.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, you go
through a famine

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:84%
where you have that stress
of not having enough

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:84%
to eat for months and
months and months.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.930 align:middle line:10%
What happens is, your
body shifts its set point.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:10%
Your body says, I
want to be 90 kilos.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.460 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you lose 10
kilos from the famine.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:10%
You go down to 70 kilos.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.470 align:middle line:10%
But your body actually
wants to be 90 kilos now.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:10%
So when there's food available,
you eat and eat and eat,

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.360 align:middle line:10%
and your metabolism
slows down, so you

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.443 align:middle line:10%
don't want to do exercise.

00:31:41.443 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:10%
You stay real sedentary.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:10%
You eat and eat until you get to
your ideal weight of 90 kilos,

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.620 align:middle line:10%
so a famine is actually going
to make your body want to be fat

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:10%
even if you lose weight.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is, all the things

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that are out there in terms
of weight loss like diet

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and pills and all
these things, anything

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that focuses on forcing
you to lose weight

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.840 align:middle line:84%
will get your body
to want to be fatter.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you to
think about from now on is,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:84%
how fat or thin does
my body want to be?

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Not how do I force
myself to be thin?

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.790 align:middle line:90%
To be fat?

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So a famine will cause your
body to want to be fat.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.893 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't have
famines anymore.

00:32:20.893 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time
anyone went through a famine?

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Can I see a show of hands?

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:25.870 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:26.640 align:middle line:90%
No famines?

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:90%
We don't famines anymore.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And when it's cold out,
we can put on clothes,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:90%
and we live indoors.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry
about cold weather.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
cold causes your body

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.415 align:middle line:84%
to want to hold onto
fat is because fat

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:90%
is like an insulator.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:84%
It keeps your body
warm and protects you

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:84%
from the outside hostile,
cold environment.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:90%
So fat acts as protection.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Protection from famines,
not having enough,

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and protection from a
hostile environment.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the purpose of fat.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.412 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't have
those things anymore.

00:32:59.412 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't have famines, and
we don't have cold weather

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:90%
that we have to worry about.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But we still have this fat
program, this fat switch

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:90%
that can activate.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.750 align:middle line:90%
And we still have stresses.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes for some people,
the stresses in our lives

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.860 align:middle line:84%
cause the exact same
chemistry as a famine.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And that could be a physical
stress of not having enough

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:84%
to eat, like a diet or
being nutritionally famined,

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
or a mental or emotional
stress, or the other things

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.280 align:middle line:90%
that we're going to talk about.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But the stress causes the
same chemistry as a famine.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
your body gets

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:84%
tricked into activating
these fat programs.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It gets tricked into activating
these ancient survival

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So you're driving to work
and it's rush hour traffic,

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.662 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're
going to be late,

00:33:47.662 --> 00:33:50.808 align:middle line:84%
and your boss is going to be mad
at you, that's causing stress.

00:33:50.808 --> 00:33:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And that stress is
causing chemistry,

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and your body doesn't
know what to do with that.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Your body's designed,
brilliantly designed

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
to protect you from stress,
from whatever the threat is.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know
what the threat is.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.467 align:middle line:84%
It just knows what the chemistry
is that's being caused.

00:34:07.467 --> 00:34:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that chemistry
is the same as the fat programs.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting
there in your car,

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
you're not eating anything,
and you're getting fatter.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:17.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Simply because we
have these programs.

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, we also have a
program inside of us

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:90%
that forces us to get thin.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I call it the get thin
or get eaten adaptation.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.338 align:middle line:84%
And what that is is, if
you were living-- let's

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:36.463 align:middle line:84%
say you were living in a
very different environment

00:34:36.463 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.219 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that it
wasn't a famine.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:41.260 align:middle line:90%
It was a warm, tropical climate.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a warm
tropical climate, you

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:84%
don't need fat to
keep you warm, right?

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:90%
To protect you from the cold.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And there's delicious fruits.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.880 align:middle line:84%
I just in Thailand for a
month doing a yoga retreat

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.565 align:middle line:84%
and meeting with this guy who's
doing our Spanish webiste.

00:34:57.565 --> 00:34:59.778 align:middle line:84%
And the fruit is
just so incredible.

00:34:59.778 --> 00:35:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
different varieties

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of delicious papayas
and this fruit

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.910 align:middle line:84%
called durian,
and longans, and--

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:08.545 align:middle line:90%
You don't like durian?

00:35:08.545 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It smells.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It stinks.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so delicious.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a durian addict.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.050 align:middle line:84%
People either love
durian or hate durian.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I love durian.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many
different fruits.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:90%
You can fish.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:84%
There's delicious--
everything's fresh.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of food.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.800 align:middle line:90%
You don't need fat anymore.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.592 align:middle line:10%
Now, in an
environment like that,

00:35:25.592 --> 00:35:27.550 align:middle line:10%
if you were living in an
environment like that,

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.520 align:middle line:10%
your body would then say, we
don't need to be 90 kilos.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:10%
We can go back to 80 kilos,
because we don't need weight

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.310 align:middle line:10%
anymore.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:37.578 align:middle line:10%
Those stresses aren't there
activating your fat programs.

00:35:37.578 --> 00:35:39.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no cold, and
there's plenty to eat.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So if there's plenty to eat, and
you can eat whatever you want--

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, eating whatever
you want whenever you want

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is a very natural
state of being.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:10%
It's only very recently that
we've stopped doing that.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you were living
in that environment

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and you could eat whatever
you want whenever you want,

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.180 align:middle line:84%
it was warm, your body wouldn't
want to be fat anymore.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So your set point
would go back to 80.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take
it a step further.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Imagine in this
living environment,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:90%
there were wild tigers.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And every couple of
weeks, or every couple

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:15.090 align:middle line:84%
of days, whatever, they
came into your village,

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and they chased you.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you weren't lightning
fast, you were dead.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.260 align:middle line:90%
You know, I thought about it.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you don't really
need to be faster than a tiger

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.012 align:middle line:90%
to escape being attacked.

00:36:32.012 --> 00:36:34.512 align:middle line:84%
You just need to be faster than
the guy running next to you.

00:36:34.512 --> 00:36:35.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Bob.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:90%
Always did like you.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.120 align:middle line:90%
But you have to be fast.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not lightning
fast, you're dead.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
type of stress

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that causes different
chemistry in your body.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:84%
That chemistry alerts
your body to the fact

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that if you are not
thin, you are dead.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I call it the the get thin
or get eaten adaptation.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:14.488 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, your body
goes, we need to be 60 kilos.

00:37:14.488 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:90%
We need to shed all our weight.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It makes your body
want to be thinner.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:10%
So a famine is going to make
your body want to be fatter,

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.880 align:middle line:10%
and a tiger is going to make
your body want to be thinner.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:10%
These are programs.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Survival programs that we
have in our body to help us

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.220 align:middle line:90%
stay alive.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.300 align:middle line:90%
What's the threat?

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Starving to death?

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Get fatter.

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Slow down your metabolism.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Be sedentary.

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:90%
What's the threat?

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Tigers can eat you?

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Get thinner.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.607 align:middle line:84%
You develop the
metabolism of a greyhound.

00:37:43.607 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:90%
You just eat a little bit.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.560 align:middle line:84%
You're like, I'm
not hungry anymore.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Your brain starts
listening to your stomach.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:90%
You have a little bit of food.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
naturally thin people

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.162 align:middle line:84%
and if you notice when they
eat, they'll eat milkshakes,

00:37:55.162 --> 00:37:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and they'll eat pizza
and something else,

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.537 align:middle line:84%
but they'll just take
a couple of bites,

00:37:58.537 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and it's sitting there.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.425 align:middle line:84%
And you're staring
at that pizza.

00:38:02.425 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Let me have two--

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I can finish that in
30-- you can't even

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:84%
focus on the conversation,
because they've

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.410 align:middle line:84%
got this gorgeous
pizza, and you've

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:84%
got your fat-free,
wheat-free Weetabix, whatever

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:90%
you're eating.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Burger without the bread and
bread without the burger.

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And they're having
their milkshake,

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and they're talking to you.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.268 align:middle line:84%
And they're really engaged
in the conversation.

00:38:23.268 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't listen to a
word they're saying.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:29.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, just, what?

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.693 align:middle line:90%
Because their brain's listening.

00:38:31.693 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Their brain starts to
listen to their stomach.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Their metabolism speeds up.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:90%
And they want to be active.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.235 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
that survival program

00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:41.180 align:middle line:90%
is being activated.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about stress--

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.027 align:middle line:84%
and nobody's ever been
able to explain this,

00:38:45.027 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure you've
all noticed this--

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is the same stress will
make one person fatter

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and another person thinner.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.527 align:middle line:84%
You know those people,
they get stressed

00:38:54.527 --> 00:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and they start losing
all that weight?

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm so stressed.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.812 align:middle line:90%
I can't eat anything.

00:38:58.812 --> 00:39:00.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, they just
lose all that weight.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.540 align:middle line:90%
You're like, great.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.486 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:39:04.486 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about?

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can't eat anything.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's activating
a different survival

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:90%
program inside their brain.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.890 align:middle line:90%


00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the same stress.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Different adaptation.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Different program.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was
working on Wall Street,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I had a business partner.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And we worked in the same desk.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.030 align:middle line:84%
He was right on the
other side of me.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And we worked
together for 11 years.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.148 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time I
was working with him,

00:39:32.148 --> 00:39:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I was getting fatter
and fatter and fatter,

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and he was getting thinner
and thinner and thinner.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And this guy used to order
milkshakes for lunch.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
He'd call up and they'd go,
uh, what will you have today?

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.062 align:middle line:84%
Uh, I think I'll
have a milkshake.

00:39:45.062 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And he'd have this
milkshake on his desk,

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and he'd have a couple of sips.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.300 align:middle line:90%
It'd be sitting there.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.675 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be ordering my hamburger
without the bun one week

00:39:50.675 --> 00:39:53.008 align:middle line:84%
and my bun without the
hamburger the next week.

00:39:53.008 --> 00:39:54.425 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be trying
to work, and I'd

00:39:54.425 --> 00:39:55.967 align:middle line:84%
be staring at his
milkshake thinking,

00:39:55.967 --> 00:39:58.105 align:middle line:90%
if I could just have 30 seconds.

00:39:58.105 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:90%
Suck that thing down.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Get a big old brain freeze.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And it would just
be sitting there.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was getting
thinner and thinner.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:84%
But what was different
about him than me is the way

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.820 align:middle line:90%
he reacted to stress.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:84%
See, whenever things
went wrong in the office,

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I would just sort of just
sit there and just take it.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Which, when you think about
it, is very similar to the way

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:90%
you would react in a famine.

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a famine, you
can't run away from it.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't fight it.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.000 align:middle line:90%
You just have to take it.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.850 align:middle line:84%
You have to just
sort of slow down.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did.

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I just took it.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:90%
I just sort of slowed down.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:84%
But this guy, the slightest
thing that would go wrong,

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and he would flail his arms.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:84%
The fax machine wouldn't work,
and he'd throw the fax machine

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.400 align:middle line:90%
He'd go, fuck.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.002 align:middle line:84%
Bernard, we need another
fucking fax machine.

00:40:59.002 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say to him,
well, Dave, Bernard's

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.188 align:middle line:90%
getting another fax machine.

00:41:07.188 --> 00:41:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But the next time that
happens, if you just

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.232 align:middle line:84%
press that green button,
that's the start button.

00:41:13.232 --> 00:41:15.290 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't happen again.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:90%


00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:20.960 align:middle line:90%
But everything.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.760 align:middle line:90%
He would react.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.460 align:middle line:90%
It was like he was in a battle.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like he was in a war.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we're sitting at the
same desk doing the same job

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:90%
and the same stress.

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But to my body, it was like
I was in an arctic wasteland

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.170 align:middle line:90%
starving to death.

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And to his body, he was in the
African Savannah fighting off

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.350 align:middle line:90%
tigers left and right.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Lions.

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Someone reminded me, there's no
tigers in the African savanna.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Fighting off lions
left and right.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
Same stress,
different adaptations.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to
figure out what's

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:04.850 align:middle line:84%
activating the fat programs in
you and turn those stresses off

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.657 align:middle line:84%
and then to impose
other stresses that

00:42:08.657 --> 00:42:10.365 align:middle line:84%
will make your body
activate the get thin

00:42:10.365 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:90%
or get eaten adaptation.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.453 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.453 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So in the Gabriel Method, I talk
about a number of stresses that

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:90%
can activate the fat programs.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you
them quickly right now.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Number one is dieting.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Dieting activates the
fat programs, right?

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a famine.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:33.095 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.095 --> 00:42:34.845 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole point
of the fat programs

00:42:34.845 --> 00:42:37.440 align:middle line:90%
is to protect you from famines.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So great.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant logic.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.760 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.110 align:middle line:90%
Calories in, calories out.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Cut your calories.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Wrong.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Simply because it activates
your body's fat programs.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:53.318 align:middle line:84%
You lose weight, but your
body wants to be fatter.

00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So dieting forces
you to gain weight,

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.650 align:middle line:84%
or dieting gets your body to
activate the fat programs.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But you can be eating
to your heart's content,

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.950 align:middle line:84%
but you can still be in
a nutritional famine.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:07.662 align:middle line:90%


00:43:07.662 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:84%
You can still be in
a nutritional famine.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.693 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.693 --> 00:43:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
the food we eat today

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.100 align:middle line:90%
is nutritionally barren.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the specific
nutrients we need in a way

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies can
digest and assimilate.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.365 align:middle line:90%
It's invented food.

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not telling
you to cut it out,

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:24.790 align:middle line:84%
but I am telling
you to add foods

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that have the nutrients
your body needs

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in a way your body can
digest and assimilate

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.600 align:middle line:84%
if your body's activating
the fat programs because

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:90%
of a nutritional famine.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.388 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, when
you're in a nutritional famine,

00:43:36.388 --> 00:43:38.180 align:middle line:84%
your body stays hungry
all the time looking

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:90%
for these specific nutrients.

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're not
giving it to them.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
calories in, calories out.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about whether
it's carbs, proteins, or fats.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.450 align:middle line:90%
It's about what carbs?

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:50.250 align:middle line:90%
What proteins?

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:90%
What fats?

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Have the specific
nutrients your body needs.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So I have two very
counter intuitive

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:05.590 align:middle line:84%
counter to mainstream
wisdom messages

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:06.940 align:middle line:90%
for the world about weight loss.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Number one is that obesity
is caused by starvation.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I bet no one's ever
told you that before.

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Starvation, meaning
in some way, your body

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is being tricked into activating
a starvation response.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Obesity is caused by starvation.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Number two, if it's
caused by starvation,

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:33.790 align:middle line:84%
the solution isn't necessarily
to cut foods out but to add.

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Add the foods your
body is starving for.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can
be off the Gabriel Method,

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.330 align:middle line:84%
if there's a method,
is if you're not

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.257 align:middle line:84%
adding everyday the
specific nutrients you need.

00:44:43.257 --> 00:44:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to lose 20
kilos in 20 days doing that,

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.320 align:middle line:84%
but what's going
to happen is you're

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.987 align:middle line:84%
going to address the
real issue, and you

00:44:48.987 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:90%
will be less hungry over time.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And you will speed
up your metabolism.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Your body will
want to be thinner.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So a nutritional family can
activate the fat programs.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Toxins.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Toxins activate
your fat programs.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We're swimming in a world of
artificial toxins, thousands

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:09.610 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of toxins.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Our body stores toxins
in your fat cells.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:15.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking in more
toxins than you can eliminate,

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.860 align:middle line:90%
your body has to store them.

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Fat cells are a chemically
neutral buffer environment

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that can protect your
body from toxins.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.770 align:middle line:84%
One study found that
there are over 800 toxins

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.695 align:middle line:90%
in an average person's fat cell.

00:45:30.695 --> 00:45:32.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're trying
to lose weight

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and you're taking
in too many toxins,

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.340 align:middle line:84%
your body will slow down
the fat loss process,

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.010 align:middle line:84%
because burning the fat causes
you to release those toxins

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.483 align:middle line:90%
into your bloodstream.

00:45:40.483 --> 00:45:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And your body's actually
trying to protect you

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:90%
from your own poisons.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So toxins can cause you to
activate your fat programs.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Medications.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Certain medications
will cause you

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.390 align:middle line:90%
to activate your fat programs.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is,
I deal with a lot of people

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.438 align:middle line:84%
that-- for example,
they're taking

00:45:56.438 --> 00:45:57.730 align:middle line:90%
medication for bipolar disease.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason they
have bipolar disease

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.798 align:middle line:84%
is because they don't have
enough omega 3 fatty acids

00:46:01.798 --> 00:46:02.790 align:middle line:90%
in their system.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And that causes a lot of
chemical brain malfunctions.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.408 align:middle line:84%
And then they go on
some sort of medication

00:46:11.408 --> 00:46:12.700 align:middle line:90%
that causes you to gain weight.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.775 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.775 --> 00:46:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's lots of different
medications that-- not all,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.530 align:middle line:84%
but there are a lot of
different medications

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:20.730 align:middle line:90%
that cause you to gain weight.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.522 align:middle line:84%
What I always try to
encourage people to do

00:46:22.522 --> 00:46:26.125 align:middle line:84%
is, by working with the
Gabriel Method principles

00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:28.500 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with stress and
adding nutrients and reducing

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.942 align:middle line:84%
toxins, working with your doctor
to get off of medications.

00:46:31.942 --> 00:46:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And people have gotten
off medications for type

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.820 align:middle line:84%
2 diabetes, heart disease,
high blood pressure, asthma,

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.560 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of digestive problems,
bipolar disease, depression,

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.850 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Artificial ingredients like
aspartame and NutraSweet--

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk more about that--
can activate the fat programs.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.425 align:middle line:90%
Mental and emotional stress.

00:46:53.425 --> 00:46:59.610 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have
stress, it causes chemistry

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.000 align:middle line:90%
of some sort in your body.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.690 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, mental stress
causes the exact same chemistry

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.060 align:middle line:10%
as a famine.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.280 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to
talk a lot about that.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.780 align:middle line:10%
But what we're going
to do is, we're

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:16.273 align:middle line:10%
to devise an approach that
systematically gets your body

00:47:16.273 --> 00:47:17.190 align:middle line:10%
to want to be thinner.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:10%
So if your body wants to be,
say, 110 kilograms right now,

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.030 align:middle line:10%
we're going to start
adding nutrients.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.070 align:middle line:10%
That's going to get your
body to maybe only want

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.072 align:middle line:10%
to be 100 kilos.

00:47:29.072 --> 00:47:31.280 align:middle line:84%
We're going to deal with
mental and emotional stress.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.770 align:middle line:84%
That's going to get your
body to want to be 90 kilos.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.990 align:middle line:10%
We're going to deal with
toxins, medications,

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.460 align:middle line:10%
artificial ingredients.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:40.808 align:middle line:90%
80 kilos.

00:47:40.808 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to impose
stresses that get your body

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.530 align:middle line:90%
to want to be thinner.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:45.550 align:middle line:10%
60 kilos.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.530 align:middle line:10%
So little by little,
your body wants

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:10%
to be thinner and
thinner and thinner

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.568 align:middle line:10%
until the whole process
happens by itself.

00:47:52.568 --> 00:47:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going
to do right now is,

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.943 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
take a short break.

00:47:55.943 --> 00:47:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, we're going

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.640 align:middle line:84%
to deal with the
physical stresses

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that cause your body to want
to activate the fat programs

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:08.000 align:middle line:90%
and how to address those.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.139 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:12.013 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:12.013 --> 00:48:15.370 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What I found in the book was
that it was kind of a necessary

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.560 align:middle line:84%
smack up the side of the head
into the world of common sense.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But the common
sense part, I just--

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I need to read it
again, and then I

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:32.590 align:middle line:84%
want to read it
again after that.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I really want to
convince my head that it's OK.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to succeed at this one.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The fear of success
comes with the weight

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and a whole lot of things.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is going to
fix a whole lot of problems,

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:90%
just shift them into reality.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.170 align:middle line:84%
In January this year, my husband
gave me the Gabriel Method

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:58.840 align:middle line:90%
book, and I haven't turned back.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I lost 20 kilos since
January this year.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's been wonderful.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It's changed my life.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.000 align:middle line:90%
