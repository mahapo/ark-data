00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There are four
states of consciousness.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.309 align:middle line:90%
There's wakefulness.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:90%
There is sleep.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:90%
There is dreaming.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
transcendental moment.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Most people spend the
majority of their lives

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
living in the first three
realms of consciousness.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And the last state
of consciousness,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
the lucid,
transcendental moments,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:84%
seem to be rare occasions that
sneak up on us, where we're

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:84%
more awake in a
dream than we are

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
in the three-dimensional
reality we live in.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Are these rare moments
reserved for coincidence

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:84%
when we pierce through the
veil of our own conditioning

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
to get a greater glimpse
of the world we live in?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Some people spend the
majority of their lives trying

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
to replicate that experience.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
that you come preloaded

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
with all the biological
and neurological machinery

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:84%
to induce that
state, then you can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:84%
comprehend that there's a
bridge between space-time

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and time-space that you can
access through the activation

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:90%
of your own pineal gland.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It's my hope that
you'll be inspired

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to create that
transcendental state

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
without any use of any drug
or exogenous substance.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:10%
And in the previous
episode, we discussed

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:10%
how the pineal gland, with
its tiny micro crystals,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:10%
can become
electrically activated.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
We also explored the
role of the pineal gland

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and its piezoelectric
properties.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
When there's a
mechanical stress applied

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
through a specific breath
that you've learned,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
the body begins to
function as a magnet,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.260 align:middle line:84%
producing an external
electromagnetic field.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, we are liberating
energy from the body

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that you can now
use to create with.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I want to
continue your understanding

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:84%
of how those tiny micro crystals
that become electrically

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
activated can begin to oscillate
and pick up frequencies

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:90%
that are beyond the senses.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.200 align:middle line:84%
This is when the pineal gland
becomes like a radio receiver,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.440 align:middle line:84%
capable of transducing
those frequencies that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.765 align:middle line:84%
carry vital information
into meaningful imagery.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:10%
Let's get started
by briefly reviewing

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:10%
some of the things we've
learned in the previous episode.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So in the article that we talked
about in the last episode,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I asked you to remember
two specific words--

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:90%
piezoelectric and transducer.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've discussed
piezoelectric in detail.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The breath that we use to move
that cerebral spinal fluid up

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, the slow, steady
inhalation through the nose,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and the contraction
of the bandas,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the individual intrinsic
muscles, coordinated

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
with the breath, locking
down those centers

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and drawing that energy all the
way up to your pineal gland,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and keeping your attention
on it and holding your breath

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
increases what's called
intrathecal pressure.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And intrathecal
pressure is the pressure

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
inside that closed system.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to contract
those intrinsic muscles,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that begins to apply
a mechanical stress

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
against those stacked,
rhombohedron crystals.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And once there's a
mechanical stress,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
now they become
electrically activated.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And the sympathetic
nervous system switches on,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
and that energy is
released up into the brain

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and that gate opens
up, now we have energy

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
moving to the top of the head.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a positive
charge on the top

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
of the head and a
negative charge,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
and as that energy
moves, we begin

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to produce that external
electromagnetic field,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:90%
a torus field.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:84%
The other word that I wanted
you to pay attention to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:90%
was transducer.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
A transducer is a device
that converts variations

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
in physical quantity, such
as pressure like we talked

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:84%
about, into an electrical
signal, or vice versa.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
It is anything that
receives a signal

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
in the form of
one type of energy

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and converts it to a
signal of another form.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, your TV
antenna picks up frequencies

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and transduces it into imagery,
and that's exactly what

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:90%
the pineal gland does.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at this chart of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:10%
You can see very slow waves
with very long wavelengths.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.970 align:middle line:10%
And you can see, on the other
end, very high frequencies

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.860 align:middle line:10%
called cosmic rays.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And as we said, when your
eyes are picking up light,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:10%
the wavelength of
that light begins

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:10%
to activate serotonin
and melatonin,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:10%
and now we function in
three-dimensional reality.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine in a meditation
your eyes are closed,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
melatonin levels are
elevated because your eye

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
is no longer perceiving light.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
There's an activation
of the pineal gland.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Once those crystals become
electrically activated,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
now they function
like a radio receiver,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and they can pick
up frequencies that

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
are no longer consistent
with visible light.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's
material that travels

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
through the speed of light
will turn into energy,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and the quantum field exists
beyond the speed of light.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Now why is that important?

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Because once the pineal
gland is activated,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and now it functions
like a radio receiver,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:84%
what is the physics that
combines the frequency

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're tapping into with
our biology in our brain?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of meditation is to
get beyond the analytical mind.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:10%
And as you learned in
previous episodes, what

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:10%
separates the conscious mind
from the subconscious mind

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:10%
is the analytical mind.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:10%
And we could say, then, the
memory bank of the known self,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:10%
the seat of our
identity, our connection

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.820 align:middle line:10%
to our known three-dimensional
reality is the neocortex.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to slow
your brainwaves down

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
in meditation from beta to
alpha, and slowing down even

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
further into theta,
you begin to suppress

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:90%
thinking in the neocortex.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you're no
longer analyzing

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're no longer thinking,
brain waves begin to slow down

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness literally
moves out of the neocortex

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and begins to move right
into that limbic brain.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Now a person is conscious
in their subconscious mind.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And now the door between the
conscious mind and subconscious

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
mind is open, and now they're
ready to access information.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if your
analytical thinking mind

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
is functioning in
high beta, you're

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
separated from the
operating system

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:84%
where you can begin to
connect to the quantum field.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So by practicing slowing
your brainwaves down

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and suppressing the
neocortex, now you

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
can use your radio receiver to
begin to tune into frequencies

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:90%
that exist beyond your senses.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Now take a look at
this image of a neuron.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
A neuron receives input
through its dendrites.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It processes all of
the information coming

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
from all of those branches and
integrates that information,

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
processes that information, and
then sends the information out

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.690 align:middle line:90%
in an output mechanism.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to talk
about the transduction

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.000 align:middle line:90%
mechanism in the brain.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Now once the pineal gland
becomes electrically activated,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:84%
once those micro crystals
begin to shimmer and oscillate,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
they can tune into frequencies
that exist beyond your senses.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And now information in
the form of frequency

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
can be received as input
into the pineal gland.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:10%
The pineal gland begins to
process it in the thalamus

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:10%
and in the hypothalamus.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:10%
And the hypothalamus, then,
begins to send signals

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:10%
to the pituitary gland.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And the pituitary gland begins
to become the output mechanism

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:10%
and begins to release
very vital neuropeptides.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the quantum field is
an invisible field of frequency

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
that unifies and connects
everything material.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And its signature, as
you get closer and closer

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to that very source energy,
are greater and greater degrees

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of order, of harmony, of
wholeness, of oneness.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So when the pineal
gland and the brain

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:84%
is functioning in a
very coherent manner,

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
it can now pick up a
signal and the orderliness

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.470 align:middle line:84%
begins to produce a very
orderly chemical expression that

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
begins to influence every one of
the hormonal centers, or energy

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:90%
centers, of the body.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
At the very exact same time,
the back part of the pituitary

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
called the posterior
pituitary, begins

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to release different chemicals
in the output mechanism.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of those chemicals
is called oxytocin.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Now oxytocin is produced in
the brain and in the heart.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:10%
And once oxytocin
levels are released,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:10%
oxytocin seeps right into the
amygdala, the survival center

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, and it shuts the
lights out for fear, for pain,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:10%
and for aggression or anger.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's only a
group of circuits

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.090 align:middle line:90%
left called love and joy.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
then, oxytocin

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
signals a chemical
called nitric oxide.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Nitric oxide signals
another chemical

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
called endothelial-derived
relaxing factor.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And that chemical
causes the arteries

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in the heart and the
lungs to literally dilate.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And now we have more energy
and more blood flow going right

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
into the heart, and this
center begins to awaken,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and the person starts to
feel an incredible gratitude

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:90%
for being alive.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the emotional
signature of gratitude

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
when you are receiving
something or something that's

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
just happened to that you find
pleasurable, you say thank you.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So the emotional
signature of gratitude

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
means something's
happening to you

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.830 align:middle line:84%
or something has
happened to you,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the ultimate
state of receiving.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Now that we're in the
state of receiving,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:90%
something amazing happens.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden now
there's processing

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that goes back from the
pineal gland right back

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
to the pituitary, which
then affects the thyroid.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It affects the heart
and the thalamus,

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and all the way down
the energy centers,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and there's a cascade of
chemistry that's created.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's remember what happens
when we do the breath.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to move that energy
up from those lower centers,

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
once energy makes it
to the fourth center,

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
the energy will continue
up into the brain.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
As it moves up and
activates the pineal gland,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and the pineal gland begins
to signal the pituitary, now

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden it begins
to release its neuropeptides

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and neurohormones, we
now know that there's

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
an external
electromagnetic field.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the person
starts to feel gratitude,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
they're in the perfect
state of receiving.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And now there's a
reverse field that's

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
coming in through the
top of the head that

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:84%
begins to draw energy from the
field right into the brain.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency is
carrying information.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And this, then, is when
the pineal gland causes

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.980 align:middle line:90%
melatonin to get an upgrade.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
This article that I found
shows that melatonin

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
has many derivatives, or what
we call metabolites or sister

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:90%
molecules.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin and melatonin are
dependent through our senses

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
on the frequency and the
wavelength of visible light.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You close your eyes now,
and all of a sudden you're

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
no longer processing
visible light.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin levels start to
go up, and the pineal gland

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
begins to receive the input and
begin to activate the pituitary

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to create more coordination,
or more neuropeptides that

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
create more harmony in
the hormonal centers.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And the posterior pituitary
begins to release oxytocin,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and the person feels
grateful to be alive.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
One field that's going
out, all of a sudden

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that second field reverses,
and that frequency

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle line:84%
now is going to cause
melatonin to get an upgrade.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
melatonin, now, is

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:84%
going to transmute, or change,
into some very powerful

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%
molecules.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And in this article,
it's very specific

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:10%
that melatonin is
already an antioxidant.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:10%
But now melatonin gets
a very big upgrade.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And now it produces two of
the most powerful antioxidants

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:90%
known to man.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
significance of that?

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Antioxidants are anti-cancer,
anti-aging, anti-stroke,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
anti-neurodegenerative,
anti-inflammatory,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:90%
anti-microbial.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin already
causes us to relax,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.430 align:middle line:84%
but now it's going to
begin to produce what's

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
called the benzodiazepine.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals fit
into the same receptors

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
as serotonin and
melatonin, but they

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:90%
carry a very different message.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
The release of these
benzodiazepines

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.610 align:middle line:84%
is literally going to
sedate further the neocortex

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.715 align:middle line:84%
and shut down the survival
centers in the brain.

00:13:56.715 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:10%
And there's a suppression
of overthinking,

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:10%
of over-analyzing, of thinking
about the future or the past,

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:10%
the body relaxes into
the present moment.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:10%
Take that molecule
and tweak it again,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:10%
and you have the most
powerful hallucinogenic known

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:10%
to man, dimethyltryptamine.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:10%
And now the person
is going to have

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:10%
profound lucid inner vision.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, melatonin
already causes us to sleep,

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but when it becomes a
transducer, that frequency,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:84%
then, is transduced into
profound imagery, the same way

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.070 align:middle line:84%
a TV antenna takes frequency
and turns it into a picture.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland has
been called the third eye

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
because we're having a profound
inner vision that is more

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.850 align:middle line:90%
real than the world we live in.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can say,
then, the person is

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
having a full-on
sensory experience

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.994 align:middle line:90%
without their senses.

00:14:56.994 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:10%
And the second chemical made
from the posterior pituitary

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.120 align:middle line:10%
is called vasopressin
antidiuretic hormone.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:10%
And when vasopressin
levels are elevated,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:10%
the cells of the body,
now, can store more water.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And now the cells are prepared
for a greater frequency.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of the cells, now, begin
to oscillate and produce more

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:90%
coherent light and information.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And we could say, in
one moment, the person's

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:90%
getting a biological upgrade.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Information from the field
is literally changing

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:90%
the human operating system.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about frequency
because most people think

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:90%
that frequencies are just waves.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to think
about frequency another way.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the pineal gland
becomes electrically activated,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
many times we start to see
these fractal patterns.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
With our eyes open,
with our eyes closed,

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
we start to see these
complex geometric patterns.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And the more orderly
those patterns are,

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:90%
the more coherent the energy is.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It is those standing
waves of energy

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that the coherent brain
and the coherent heart

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
will begin to transduce
just like a barcode.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
A laser reads the barcode and
interprets the information.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Pineal gland decodes
that information

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.925 align:middle line:84%
into profound
pictures and imagery.

00:16:23.925 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:10%
Here's my greatest definition
of the pineal gland.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:10%
"The pineal gland,
when fully activated,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:10%
is a crystalline superconductor
that receives information

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:10%
through the transduction of
energetic vibrational signals--

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:10%
that's frequencies beyond the
senses, the quantum field--

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.390 align:middle line:10%
"into biological tissue,
the brain and the mind,

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:10%
in the form of
meaningful imagery,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.990 align:middle line:10%
the same way as an antenna
translates different channels

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.720 align:middle line:10%
onto a TV screen."

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And when the pineal
gland is activated,

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
now we have information
that's being downloaded

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:84%
into our nervous system that's
transcendent of our senses.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
side effect of that?

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Here comes the profound
mystical moment.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
You now may have the experience
of moving from space-time

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
to time-space where all
of those dimensions exist.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
Now you may have the experience
of coming out of your body,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:84%
traveling down a
long tunnel of light,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
your body being
filled with energy

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
that you are now perceiving.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:84%
You may experience
a past, present,

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:36.380 align:middle line:84%
or future life that's all
happening in the eternal now.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you
just a few brain scans

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
to unify all this information.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.750 align:middle line:84%
This is normal brain
activity, and the person

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is in low beta
brainwave patterns.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Now they go into a meditation.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We start to see the energy in
the brain begin to escalate.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:84%
That person is transitioning
from high beta,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting to move
into very coherent gamma.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
By the same means,
this person is

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
having a full-on
sensory experience

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:90%
without their senses.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
This person, second-generation
Holocaust survivor suffering

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:90%
from anxiety and depression.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
A psychotherapist did everything
he could to change his state.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
In one moment, this person has
a transcendental experience

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that's transcendent of this
three-dimensional reality,

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and in an instant, his
depression and his anxiety

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
changes and goes away.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we have
two waves that are

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:10%
coherent that are oscillating
in order, or coherence,

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:10%
they summate and
produce a higher wave.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's the
significance of that?

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
The higher the wave, the
higher the amplitude,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.740 align:middle line:84%
the higher the energy
in the brain, which

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:84%
means the more coherent
the brain becomes,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the higher the energy
will exist in the brain.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this
person at an event.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:84%
We do a normal baseline
measurement of her brain.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we start
noticing a few minutes

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
into her measurements
in real time,

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
you can see the energy in
the brain start to pick up.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on, it just
gets getting bigger and bigger.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And you can see right
here, the person

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is transitioning from beta
into gamma brainwave patterns.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There'll come a moment where
you see it go very, very high.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:10%
And this is the moment now
the pineal gland is connecting

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:10%
to the field and
that person is having

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:10%
a very profound inner event.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:10%
We measure coherence when--

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:10%
it's low coherence, we measure
it as blue, like it's cold

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:10%
or it's cool.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:10%
Normal coherence
means it's pink.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:10%
There's no blue
or there's no red.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:10%
When there's high coherence,
or high order in the brain,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:10%
we measure it as red.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
The thicker the red
lines, the further outside

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:90%
of normal it is.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
This is her scan.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the second
to the bottom line--

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
and we read from left to right--

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
you can see this person moving
into very high coherence

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the
top right-hand corner.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
This particular program
does not read gamma,

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:84%
but you can tell that the
person's in high beta,

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're on
their way to gamma.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we measure, from
the spectral analysis,

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:84%
the amount of gamma that's
taking place in her brain,

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:84%
this person is 200
standard deviations outside

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.030 align:middle line:84%
of normal in gamma
brainwave patterns.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:10%
Now let's talk about
standard deviations.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:10%
This is what's called a
Z-score, or a Z curve.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And a group of 100 people, or
1,000 people, or 10,000 people,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
or 50 people, we were to measure
height, or weight, or hearing,

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
or vision, or intelligence,
no matter what we measured,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
we would see this
standard bell curve.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you look where the
blue is, and you draw a line

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:10%
right down the middle of that
bell, that's absolute normal.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And if you break
this bell curve up

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:10%
into three sections,
34% a little bit

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:10%
above normal, 34% a
little bit below normal--

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:10%
we'll still call that
normal, and it makes up

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:10%
the majority of the surface
area of that bell curve.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:10%
68% of the people we
call average or normal.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the red,
you see 13% on both sides,

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:10%
and the curve dips
down a little bit more,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:10%
now you have somebody with
a little better eyesight

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:10%
or with a little worse eyesight.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:10%
And then if you look
at the very extremity,

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:10%
the third standard
deviation, you'll

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:10%
see some people with
really great eyesight

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:10%
and really poor eyesight.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you total up
the complete number,

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:10%
99.7% of the population falls
three standard deviations

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:10%
above normal or three standard
deviations below normal.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we said this person had
200 standard deviations outside

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:90%
of normal and gamma.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
measurement of height.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.020 align:middle line:84%
You could see the person on the
right is the tallest person.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
The person on the left
is the shortest person.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.260 align:middle line:10%
But the average is the
center of that curve.

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:10%
That's 99.7% of the population.

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:10%
This is the standard
normal bell curve.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.420 align:middle line:84%
This is five
standard deviations.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:90%
This is 50 standard deviations.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:90%
This is 100 standard deviations.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:90%
This is 150 standard deviations.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:84%
This is 200 standard
deviations outside of normal.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, another 197
of those blocks, and the line

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
just gets closer
and closer together.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I would call that a supernatural
amount of energy in the brain.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the area of the
brain that's most activated.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:84%
That red area represents
the area right

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
around the pineal gland and an
area called Brodmann's area 30.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, Brodmann's area
30 is responsible

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:84%
for highly-charged experiences
or emotional events that

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
produce the emotions of joy, of
love, of bliss, and of ecstasy.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:10%
And this person is having a
transcendental experience.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
There's the neocortex in blue,
that means lights are out

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:90%
in the thinking brain.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And now the autonomic
nervous system, in red there,

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:84%
is the area that's
lit up the most.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.758 align:middle line:84%
That is the area that's
processing a greater frequency.

00:23:41.758 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And now this is the
underside of the brain,

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the
brain from the bottom.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that the
autonomic nervous system

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
is very, very high
in a gamma state.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, this person is
a physician, and she

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
had eczema from the time
she was three months old.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And as a physician, she
did all the right things.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.040 align:middle line:84%
She applied the
cortisone creams.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:90%
She took the antihistamines.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:90%
She monitored her diet.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.150 align:middle line:90%
She didn't eat sugar.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:90%
She stayed away from starches.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:90%
She stayed away from alcohol.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:90%
She was treating the condition.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, she was
able to keep it controlled,

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:90%
but it never went away.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.770 align:middle line:84%
This is her arm before
she came to the event.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
On the Monday after the
event this is her arm.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Her body received
a new frequency.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And if all disease is
a lowering of frequency

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
in an incoherent frequency, once
that orderly message made it

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.990 align:middle line:84%
into the nervous system, she
got a biological upgrade.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Here's her hand with
eczema before the event.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.930 align:middle line:84%
This is her hand the
Monday after the event.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I just saw this woman,
almost two years later,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and she still has no evidence
or no sign of eczema.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this person.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Baseline measurement,
and all of a sudden you

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:84%
can see the
frequency picking up.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But look how organized and
coherent that frequency is.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:10%
This person taps out at
260 standard deviations

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:10%
outside of normal.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.990 align:middle line:10%
That's a lot of
energy in the brain.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The same exact area,
the pineal gland,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:84%
the surrounding area
of the pineal gland,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and Brodmann's area 30.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:90%
This person is in ecstasy.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
This person is creating
a long-term memory.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
They're having a full-on
sensory experience

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
without their senses, and they
can't make their brain do that.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:middle line:90%
It's happening to them.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:90%
Here's another person.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Here's the strip chart for
measuring normal brainwaves.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.940 align:middle line:90%
Watch what happens.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.740 align:middle line:84%
As they begin to
connect to that field

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and they suppress
the neocortex, you

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
can see a building of energy
that takes place in the brain.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And this person finishes
at 160 standard deviations

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.500 align:middle line:90%
outside of normal.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And take a look at all the
coherence in his brain.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain is
coherent, we're coherent.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:90%
Now, another person.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
You can see that there's
beta brainwave patterns.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, like
in a matter of seconds,

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
it seems like the brain
starts to build in energy.

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And as it starts to synchronize,
it starts to accelerate.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
This person finishes at
250 standard deviations

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.690 align:middle line:90%
outside of normal in gamma.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Every single area of the
brain is synchronized.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:10%
We're seeing, now, coherence
in delta, and theta, and alpha,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:10%
and beta, and high beta,
and there's enormous amount

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:10%
of energy in the brain.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And the whole entire
neocortex, as well as

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland and
the surrounding areas,

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is fully activated.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Check this out now.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
What we started to
notice is that when

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
people begin to
do this properly,

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that happens
is we start seeing theta

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:84%
as a precursor before the person
goes into an aroused state.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they have
to settle their body down

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.440 align:middle line:10%
and begin to move in such
a slow brainwave pattern

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.340 align:middle line:10%
that now they're suppressing
the thinking neocortex,

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:10%
and in low level theta, lights
are out in the identity.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:10%
The known self is now shut off.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And once they're in that
slow brainwave state,

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
it says if theta
acts as a carrier

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:84%
wave, the parasympathetic
nervous system is activated.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:90%
The person is relaxed.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And now when they
lock into a frequency,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.780 align:middle line:90%
the arousal takes place.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Coherent theta becomes
the carrier for gamma.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:90%
And check this out.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
The person is opening
their awareness

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and connecting to the field
of energy and information.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing 10 standard
deviations outside of normal

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:90%
in theta.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we see
this in a brain scan,

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
we know what's going
to happen next.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:84%
The person is going to
go into an aroused state.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
This person is 200 standard
deviations outside of normal

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:56.180 align:middle line:84%
as they travel from high
beta right into gamma.

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Last one now.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:84%
We start to see body
is sleeping in theta.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:84%
The mind is very
active and very awake.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
There's coherence in
every single brainwave

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
state from delta all
the way to high beta.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:84%
When we see this,
we know the person's

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
going from a slow
frequency of theta,

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
now they're operating
from their limbic brain.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:10%
If they can tune in like
a radio receiver and tune

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:10%
into frequency and
information, all of a sudden,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.670 align:middle line:10%
here we go, there's that
theta brainwave state.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen next?

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:90%
It's going to start to build.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And next thing you know, they're
moving into that high gamma

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:90%
brainwave state.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And that high gamma
brainwave state, then,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:84%
begins to cause the
area of the pineal gland

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and Brodmann's area 30
to begin to switch on,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:84%
and that person moves to
400 standard deviations

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.790 align:middle line:90%
outside of normal.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:53.300 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
energy in their brain.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So by now, I hope you
understand that when

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland
becomes activated,

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
it literally begins to
transduce powerful frequencies

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:90%
into meaningful imagery.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
side effect of that?

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:84%
When the person returns
back to their senses,

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
we don't see things how they
are, we see things how we are.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And since experience enriches
the brain-- and it does--

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and experience produces an
emotion in the body, when

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the person comes
back to their senses,

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
now their brain is
wired to perceive

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
what has always
existed, but they didn't

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:90%
have the circuits to perceive.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, our spectrum
of reality is broadened.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.620 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode, we're
going to discuss heart and brain

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:10%
coherence and why it's so
important to have your brain

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:10%
and heart synchronized.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.680 align:middle line:84%
When your nervous
system is balanced,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
it sends a very coherent message
to all the cells and tissues

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
of your body, and
that's called health.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe
Dispenza, for "Rewired,"

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see you
in the next episode

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.410 align:middle line:84%
where we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:90%
