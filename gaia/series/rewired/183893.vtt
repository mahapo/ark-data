>> What I love about researching
the brain in our biology is

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:84%
that it has allowed me to
present the latest findings

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:84%
of what's humanly possible

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that we're
not hardwired to be

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
a certain way for the
rest of our lives,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and we're not
doomed by our genes.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.225 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are
marvels of change.

My job as a doctor for 31 years,
as well as a lecturer, author,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and researcher is to not just
talk about what is possible,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
but to show you the latest
data that supports my work.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
That your thoughts can have
an effect on your brain,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:90%
your body, and your life.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:84%
This is a time in history
where it's not enough to know.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a time in
history to know how.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.808 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and I'm going to show you

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:10%
how to rewire your brain.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:10%
I want to start off by asking
you a strange question--

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.800 align:middle line:10%
what does it mean to
you to be supernatural?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
To me, being
supernatural is to be

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
able to change your
body by thought alone.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
To say it another way, it means
being greater than your body.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Being supernatural also
means overcoming challenges

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and conditions in
your outer environment

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that most people would
not be able to accomplish.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
In addition, being
supernatural would also

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
mean to be able to change some
predictable future destiny

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
or event.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
That is, to be
greater than time.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Now is this
something that's only

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
reserved for ancient
yogis, mystical masters,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and superheroes?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Is it fantasy, or is
there medical proof

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that each human being has the
potential to heal themselves,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and in a sense, to
become supernatural?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
In 1986, I had my own
personal experience

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:90%
that forever changed my life.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:10%
A serious injury forced me
to meld together everything

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:10%
I knew from my scientific
mind and my training

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:10%
to a greater level
of understanding

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:10%
about the nature of reality
and what is possible.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Much of what I
discovered was not

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
found in conventional textbooks
and mainstream science.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I had to find answers
for my own personal healing

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:10%
by delving into areas
of science that point

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:10%
the finger at possibility.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I want to invite you into a
journey and a scientific study

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:84%
of your mind, your
heart, and your body

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
with a series called "Rewired."

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with some
basics about the brain

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
that you should know
right from the very start.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to offer you a new
way of concept in your brain.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Think of your brain as
three brains in one.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:10%
You literally have
three brains that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:10%
allow you to go from
thinking to doing to being.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's start off
with your first brain,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:90%
called your neocortex.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:10%
Your neocortex is the seat
of your conscious mind.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:10%
It's the largest
and most evolved

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:10%
in human beings and dolphins.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the part of your
brain that plugs you

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
into three dimensional reality.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:10%
It's divided into different
regions and different areas.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:10%
So the front of the brain,
called the forebrain,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:10%
makes up 40% of
your entire brain.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:10%
It's the largest
in human beings,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:10%
and it's what separates
us from all other species.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
The next closest species,
gibbons and chimpanzees,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:84%
their frontal lobe is about
14% to 17%, dogs about 7%,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:90%
and cats about 3%.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the frontal
lobe has been known

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to be called the area
of executive function.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But think of the frontal
lobe as the CEO of the brain

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:90%
or the symphony leader.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:10%
The frontal lobe allows
us to decide on action,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:10%
to focus our concentration,
to invent, to speculate,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:10%
to have intention or attention.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:10%
It's the area of our
brain that restrains

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:10%
our emotional
reactions or begins

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:10%
to speculate new possibilities.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So think of your frontal lobe
as the seat of your conscience

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:90%
or your creative center.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, the rest of the brain
is divided up into geography

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:10%
For example, the
back of your brain,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:10%
called the occipital lobe
or the visual cortex,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:10%
is where you process sight
or spatial orientation.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:10%
There's strips and
areas of your brain

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:10%
that allow you to feel
certain things with your body

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:10%
or to invoke or begin to
initiate motor function

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:10%
or movement.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
They're areas of
the brain that allow

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
you to make long-term memories
and to begin to distinguish

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:90%
between self and non-self.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
But the entire brain is
mapped geographically,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and think of that first
brain as that part

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that allows
you to learn new things

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:90%
and to have new experiences.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So then every time you
learn something new,

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:84%
you make new connections
in your brain.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Learning is forging new
synaptic connections.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
In some of the latest
research in neuroscience

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that says that one hour of
focused concentration on one

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
concept or idea
literally doubles

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
the number of connections
in your brain,

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
literally produces
physical evidence

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:84%
as a result of your
interaction in the environment.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So then all of this philosophy,
this intellectual data,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
this theory, this knowledge is
stored in that neocortex called

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
your thinking brain.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next step is
to take that knowledge,

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that philosophy, and to begin
to apply it, to personalize it,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to demonstrate it, to initiate
that knowledge in some way.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this properly
and you can get your behaviors

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:84%
to match your intentions,
you can get your actions

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:90%
equal to your thoughts.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You can get your mind and
body working together,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a new experience.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're in the
midst of an experience,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:84%
all of your five senses plug
you into the environment.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And as all of that
sensory information

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:84%
rushes back to your
brain, jungles of neurons

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
begin to organize themselves
into patterns and networks.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So then experience then enriches
the philosophical circuits

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, and when
those neurons begin

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to form into networks,
the second brain,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
called the limbic brain,
the emotional brain,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
the chemical brain,
the mammalian brain,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
begins to make a chemical,
and that chemical is

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
called a feeling or an emotion.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you
feel unlimited,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
the moment you feel
abundant, the moment you

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
feel free from any
experience, now you

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are teaching your
body chemically

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to understand what your mind
has intellectually understood.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So we can say that knowledge is
for the mind and experience is

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
for the body.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
you embodying

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:90%
the truth of that philosophy.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And because there's new
information coming in

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:84%
from the environment,
you're literally

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
beginning to change your
genetic destiny by signaling

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:90%
new genes in new ways.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And it is the limbic brain
or the chemical brain

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:10%
that begins to manufacture
those chemicals so

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:10%
that your body begins to
become chemically instructed

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:10%
to understand which your mind
has intellectually understood.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Now the limbic brain also
has some other functions.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the seat of your
autonomic nervous system.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And think of your
autonomic nervous system

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:84%
as your automatic
nervous system.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:10%
This is the part of the brain
that subconsciously regulates

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:10%
blood sugar levels, hormone
levels, temperature,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.020 align:middle line:10%
respiration, heart rate.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the part
of the brain that's

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:90%
giving us life automatically.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you begin
to manufacture that chemical

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:84%
from an experience,
the emotional signature

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
from that experience begins to
change your body in some way.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
If you've been able to
create that experience once,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.820 align:middle line:84%
you should be able
to recreate it again.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you're able to recreate
any experience over and over

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
again, you are going to
begin to neurochemically

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
condition your mind and
body begin to work as one.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you've done
something so many times

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
that your body now knows how
to do it as well as your mind,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:90%
now it's innate in you.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It's second nature.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It's familiar.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you've done
it so many times

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that you no longer have to
consciously think about it.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So it begins to become
a subconscious program.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:10%
So then you know
you do it but you

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:10%
don't know how you know how.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:10%
And we could say now that you're
developing a skill or a habit.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're beginning
to master that philosophy,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving into
a new state of being.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:10%
And when you do this
properly, over and over again,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:10%
you activate that third
brain called your cerebellum.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:10%
This is the part of the
brain that's responsible

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:10%
for you beginning
to develop what's

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:10%
called implicit memories
or nondeclarative memories.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Where you've done
something so many times

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
that you no longer have the
conscious who think about it.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So our job then is
to go from knowledge

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
to experience to wisdom.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:90%
From mind to body to soul.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
From learning it with your head,
applying it with your hands,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and knowing it by heart.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
common people around the world

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
are doing the uncommon when
they follow this formula.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
They're healing themselves
of near-fatal diseases.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
They're reversing cancers.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
They're healing from
childhood scars and wounds.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:10%
They're creating new
jobs, new opportunities,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:10%
and they're having
mystical experiences that

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:10%
transcend language, and
they look just like you.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about different
ways on how the brain works.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Number one, we've
all heard that when

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
you lose a certain number
of neurons in your brain

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that those neurons
will never come back.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But there is an emerging field
of science called neurogenesis,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and neurogenesis literally means
"the growth of new neurons."

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.880 align:middle line:10%
And our research
has found that when

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:54.060 align:middle line:10%
people begin to learn new
things and have new experiences,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.730 align:middle line:10%
not only will they
begin to cultivate

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:10%
new synaptic connections
in their brain,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:10%
but they will actually flourish
the growth of new neurons

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:10%
as a result of those novel
experiences and learning.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've even discovered
that within four days,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
we begin to activate
the very gene that

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
processes that change.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So, the studies that were
done in the early 1900s

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
said that no neurons
can grow in the brain.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Those scientists
were studying rodents

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:90%
in an unchanging environment.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So if rodents are in an
unchanging environment

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and there's no new stimulation,
there's no new activities,

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:84%
there's no new experiences,
then their brains

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:90%
will stay the same.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about you.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
If you think the same
thoughts every single day,

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and for the most
part, most people--

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
80% to 90% of their thoughts
are the same thoughts as the day

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
In your biology, your neural
circuitry, your neurochemistry,

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:84%
your hormones, and even
your gene expression

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is equal to how you think,
how you act, and how you feel.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, everything
stays the same in the body

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:90%
if you stay the same.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, it begs the question
then, is it possible

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that new thoughts that
lead to new choices, that

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
lead to new behaviors, that
create new experiences, that

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.640 align:middle line:84%
lead to new emotions and new
feelings, that could inspire

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.450 align:middle line:84%
new thoughts begin to
change your biology,

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.390 align:middle line:84%
would you begin to see
significant changes

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in the brain as
well as the body?

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And our research proves
that when you change,

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:90%
everything changes around you.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The second concept
I want to talk about

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:90%
is the concept of coherence.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And think about coherence
as rhythm or order

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
or synchronization.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
People who live by the hormones
of stress on a daily basis--

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and for the most part, that's
70% of the time for most

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:90%
human beings--

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.830 align:middle line:84%
and when you're
living in stress,

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:90%
you're living in survival.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
perceiving some threat

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.405 align:middle line:84%
in your external environment
where you perceive a danger

00:14:22.405 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and you have the perception of
something that could get worse,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
it turns on that
primitive nervous system

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
called your fight or
flight nervous system.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
in stress, you're

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
always trying to control
or predict an outcome.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So people who live under
the gun of those chemicals,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
those emergency chemicals,
are shifting their attention

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:84%
very quickly from one
person in their life

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to another person in
their life, to something

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:84%
at some place at some time,
to meetings, to places

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.140 align:middle line:90%
they have to go.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of those elements

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that are known in their
external environment

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:84%
are neurological networks that
are reflected in their brain.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So under the urgency and the
arousal of the stress hormones,

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
we begin to shift our attention
from one person to one thing,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
we activate these
individual circuits.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And like a lightning
storm in the clouds,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
the brain begins to fire out
of order very incoherently.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain is
incoherent, you're incoherent.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain
isn't working right,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.300 align:middle line:90%
you're not working right.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's this state that
begins to cause the brain

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
to function like a house
divided against itself.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Different compartments of the
brain no longer synchronize.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And we found the
formula to teach people

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:84%
how to create more order and
more coherence in their brain.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:10%
And when they do this
properly, without the aid

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:10%
of some type of
drug, medication,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:10%
or some type of
external therapy,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:10%
if they just practice
that formula,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:10%
that can begin to make
their brain work better.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:10%
When your brain is
functioning right,

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see the
world very differently.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And so coherence then
is when the brain

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
starts to unify those different
communities of neurons

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.122 align:middle line:90%
that were once subdivided.

00:16:14.122 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you see
the front of the brain start

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
resonating and
begin to oscillate

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:90%
with the back of the brain.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
You see the right
side of the brain

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.688 align:middle line:84%
starts synchronizing with
the left side of the brain,

00:16:24.688 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and the brain is
starting to function

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:90%
in a more holistic state.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And what syncs in the
brain links in the brain,

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you
start feeling more whole.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.740 align:middle line:84%
By the same means,
when a person is

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
living by the
hormones of stress,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
there's only three things
that primitive nervous system

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
wants to do when you're
living in survival--

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:90%
to run, to fight, or to hide.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And because social mores say
you can't fight, you can't run,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
or you can't hide, many times,
people are stepping on the gas

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:84%
because that emergency system
is telling them to act.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're in
a business meeting,

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
they're in a car
with their children,

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
they're on the
phone with somebody,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's those
stress hormones that

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to activate the
heart to race, because blood

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.460 align:middle line:84%
needs to be pumped to the
extremities in that state.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But you're stepping on the
gas, and at the same time,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
you're stepping on the
brake, and the heart starts

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:90%
to function incoherently.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And when your heart
functions incoherently,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:90%
you stop trusting yourself.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
then, the heart

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
begins to send very, very
inconsistent messages

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to the brain and
the person starts

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to move into disease
or imbalance.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:10%
And so teaching people then
how to create heart coherence

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:10%
and to create brain coherence
and to synchronize coherence

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:10%
between their heart
and their brain

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:10%
begins to make
significant changes,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:10%
not only in their health,
but in their life.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:10%
And by the same
means, that when you

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:10%
begin to create brain
and heart coherence,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:10%
there's more energy
going to the brain.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And that energy then
is causing the brain

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to function from a
greater level of awareness

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
or a greater level
of consciousness.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to show you in
this series how much energy.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
The brain can tolerate when you
start moving into these states.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And not just a little
change in energy,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
but a significant
change in energy.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
This is happening independent
of using some diet

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
or changing something
about yourself or exercise.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:84%
This is about by
thought alone being

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:84%
able to create more
order and communication

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
between your heart
and your brain.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, you have
more energy in your brain

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to execute in your life.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:84%
To be more present, to
make better decisions,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to think beyond the
limitations or the conditions

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:90%
in your environment.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.900 align:middle line:10%
In order for people
to truly begin

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:10%
to make significant
changes in their life,

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:10%
they have to get beyond
the memory of themselves.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:10%
Now let's talk about that.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:10%
Your personality creates
your personal reality,

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:10%
and your personality is made up
of how you think, how you act,

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:10%
and how you feel.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So the present
personality called

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
you who's watching
this show has created

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
the present personal
reality called your life.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Which means if you
wanted to create

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
a new personal
reality or a new life,

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
you would have to
change your personality.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:10%
And as you begin to think
about how you've been thinking,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:10%
notice how you've been acting,
and you begin to pay attention

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:10%
to how you've been
feeling, the act

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:10%
of observing those
states of mind and body

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:10%
begins to disconnect from
everything known in your life.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you wanted to create
something new in your life,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:84%
you would have to get
beyond your present identity

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:90%
or personality.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to
apply this formula,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:84%
you'll begin to see significant
changes, not only within you,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:90%
but in the world around you.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we've done
extensive research

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
to show that people can do this
in a very short amount of time.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:10%
In fact, we had a
university in Australia

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:10%
on the Gold Coast called
Bond University take

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:10%
a look at thousands
of our brain scans.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And they found
that our community

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of people that had
their brains measured

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
were able to accomplish
this feat in 4 seconds

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%
and 9 seconds and 15 seconds.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they've
developed the skill

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
on how to get beyond
their analytical mind,

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
get beyond their personality in
order to create something new.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We also have done
measurements to show

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that 80% of the people that
had their brain measured

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:84%
had more than 90%
change in their brain

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:84%
for the better just by
applying this formula.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I can also tell you
in studying brains,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.270 align:middle line:84%
in the process of change
and transformation,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
that when you're
analyzing your life

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:84%
within some disturbing
emotion that you're

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.210 align:middle line:84%
going to make your
brain worse every time.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Now think about this--

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
emotions are a
record of the past.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They are the end product
of past experiences.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you're living your life
from some familiar emotion,

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and that emotion
typically is driven

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
by the hormones
of stress, as long

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
as you're thinking
within that emotion,

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
we could say then you
are thinking in the past.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
That the solution
to your problems

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is not thinking
within that emotion.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's getting beyond
yourself and beginning

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond the
emotion, and when you do,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:84%
you get beyond your
past, and now you're

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.160 align:middle line:84%
no longer viewing your
future or yourself

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:90%
through the lens of the past.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The side effect of that is that
you begin to see possibilities

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that you never saw before.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So then, teaching people
how to get beyond themselves

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and teaching them how to cease
the normal analytical processes

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
of how we begin to change and
teach them another way to do it

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
begins to produce significant
and measurable changes

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:10%
In other words, it takes
a long time for you

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.960 align:middle line:10%
as a personality to
change your personality.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:10%
It takes a long time for
the ego to change the ego.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:10%
It takes a long time for
some subconscious program

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:10%
or some habit to
change some habit.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But the formula
that we teach people

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.090 align:middle line:84%
on how to get beyond
themselves allows

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
them to become so conscious
that they're no longer immersed

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
in the personality
of somebody else,

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.115 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
first step to change.

00:22:53.115 --> 00:22:56.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So how is this
information changing

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the way we look at the world
when we go from thinking

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:90%
to doing to being?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I can stand here and tell
you that when people begin

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to learn the proper information,
and when you combine

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:84%
a little quantum physics
with a little neuroscience

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
with a little psychoneuro
immunology with a little bit

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
of epigenetics, all
of those sciences

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:90%
point the finger at possibility.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So as people begin
to learn information

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and they can explain that
information to someone,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:84%
they're beginning to install
the neurological hardware

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
in their brain in preparation
for an experience.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They're making their brain
fire in new sequences,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
in new patterns, in
new combinations.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you make your
brain work differently,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:90%
you're changing your mind.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And the more that they
understand what they're doing

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and why they're doing
it, the how gets easier.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And the antithesis
is also true too.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
If you can't explain
that information,

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.620 align:middle line:90%
it's not wired in your brain.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of the
explanation process then,

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:84%
as we add new stitches
into the three dimensional

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
tapestry of our gray
matter, is we're doing this

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
install that circuitry

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing is
left to conjecture.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is left to superstition.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is left to dogma.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That when people understand
exactly what they're doing

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:84%
and why and they assign
more meaning to it,

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
they put more
intention behind it

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:90%
and they get greater outcomes.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So once people can
understand that information

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.050 align:middle line:84%
from an intellectual,
theoretical understanding

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
in their thinking
neocortex, if I

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:84%
can set up the conditions
in the environment

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and give them the proper
instructions and making it

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:84%
their behaviors to
match their intentions

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and their actions equal
to their thoughts,

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
when they get their mind
and body working together,

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
they have some type
of transformation.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So what's the side
effect of this process?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing common
people around the world

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.730 align:middle line:90%
doing the uncommon.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, becoming
supernatural.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about healing
from chronic health conditions,

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:84%
from cancer, to diabetes, to
Parkinson's disease, to lupus,

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to spinal cord injuries,
traumatic brain injuries,

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
to anxiety, to depression, and
even rare genetic disorders

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that medical science has
had no solution for .

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And when they reach
this point, they're

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
stepping back into their
lives supernatural.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:84%
They are greater
than their bodies.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They are greater
than the conditions

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:84%
in their environment,
and now they're

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:90%
in a whole new line of time.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:10%
And as a result, not
only do they change,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.880 align:middle line:10%
but their life changes as well.

Now that you have
this basic information

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:10%
on how the brain works,
I'd like to take you

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.410 align:middle line:10%
on a journey on how to
use it to create change

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:10%
and how to apply
it to your life.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.580 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
I want to dive

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:84%
into what it truly means to
change and why so many of us

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:90%
find it so hard to change.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Dr. Joe
Dispenza for "Rewired,"

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see you on
the next episode, where

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.170 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.
