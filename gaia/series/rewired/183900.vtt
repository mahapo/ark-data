>> Why is change so hard?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And why do so many people talk
about a better future, a better

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.560 align:middle line:10%
body, or a better
mindset, but yet they

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.330 align:middle line:10%
can't seem to actually
change on a deeper level?

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Why do so many of us wait
for crisis, trauma, disease,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%
diagnosis, betrayal,
or even loss

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
to finally make up
our mind to change?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we
can learn and change

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
in a state of pain
and suffering.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Or we can learn and change in
a state of joy and inspiration.

And in the previous
episode, we went into depth

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:10%
on how the brain works from
a scientific point of view.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to show you
how the brain and the body

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
react to change and what that
biological model looks like.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
This episode will help you
understand a fundamental part

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to
become supernatural

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
so that you as the viewer can
move past the pain of yesterday

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:90%
into the joy of a new future.

What is change?

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:10%
Let's assume that your
thoughts have something

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:10%
to do with your
destiny or your future,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:10%
that you believe that your
thoughts create your life.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
In the last episode,
I mentioned that you

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
think 60,000 to 70,000
thoughts in one day.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And 90% of those thoughts are
the same thoughts as the day

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:10%
So if you believe that your
thoughts have something

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:10%
to do with your future,
and 90% of those thoughts

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:10%
are exactly the same as the
day before, then it makes sense

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:10%
then your life or
your future isn't

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.510 align:middle line:10%
going to change very much
because the same thoughts

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:10%
always lead to the same choices.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:10%
The same choices always
lead to the same behaviors.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:10%
The same behaviors create
the exact same experiences.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And the same experiences
produce the same emotions.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And those same emotions
begin to influence

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:90%
your very same thoughts.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And everything in your
biology stays the same.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Your neurocircuitry, your
neurochemistry, your hormones,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and even your gene expression
is equal to how you think,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
how you act, and how you feel.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And how you think, how
you act, and how you feel

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.380 align:middle line:90%
is called your "personality."

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And your personality
is intimately

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:84%
connected to your life
or your personal reality.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Reason this with me.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a principle in
neuroscience called Hebb's law.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And Hebb's law says that
nerve cells that fire together

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:90%
wire together.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep thinking
the same thoughts,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
making the same
choices, demonstrating

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
the same behaviors, creating
the same experiences,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and producing the same feelings
and emotions for the last 10

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
years, it makes
sense then you're

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
going to begin to hardwire
your brain into a very

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
finite signature.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And that box in your brain by
the time you're 35 years old

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
becomes a very hardwired
set of programs.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
That becomes your
identity or personality.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:10%
And that 35-year-old mark
means that most people

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:10%
by the time they
reach that age become

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:10%
a set of memorized behaviors,
unconscious emotional

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:10%
reactions, automatic habits,
hardwired attitudes, beliefs,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:10%
and perceptions that function
just like a computer program.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:10%
So now when a person
decides to change

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:10%
and they're using 5%
of their conscious mind

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:10%
to go against what they've
memorized subconsciously 95%,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:10%
they can think
positively all they want.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But that thought
will actually never

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
make it past their brain
stem into their body

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
because their thought
is saying one thing,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and their body has been
conditioned into the past.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So I assert that if you're
not using your thoughts

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to be defined by a
vision of the future

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
to create a new
life, then you're

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
left with the
memories of your past.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And you will become
predictable in your life.

[ALARM BUZZES]

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:90%
So most people then--

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
when they wake up in the
morning, they're a clean slate.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They're not thinking anything.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not feeling anything.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of moments,
because the brain

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
is a record of the
past, they start

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
thinking about those problems,
those problems in their life

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with certain
people and certain objects

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and certain things at
certain times and places.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:84%
The moment they start
thinking about those problems,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking in
the past because they

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:90%
are memories from the past.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And every single one of
those conditions or problems

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
has an emotion
associated with them.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And the definition of
a feeling or an emotion

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
is a record of a
past experience.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And the moment they get in touch
with those familiar feelings,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.398 align:middle line:84%
and those feelings are
driving their thoughts,

00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and you believe that your
thoughts have something

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
to do with your destiny,
we could say then

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:90%
they're thinking in the past.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they're
thinking in the past,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
their past will always
be their future.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, certain people--
they get caught

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in these loops of thinking
and feeling and feeling

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:90%
and thinking.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, why does this happen?

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:84%
If feelings and emotions
are the end product

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
of past experiences, and
you can remember experiences

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
better because you can
remember how they feel,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
we could say then that
the stronger the emotion

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
you feel from some problem
or condition in your life,

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.120 align:middle line:84%
the more altered you feel
inside of you, the more it's

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.118 align:middle line:90%
going to wake you up.

00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
pay attention to what's

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:90%
causing it outside of you.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you narrow
your focus on the cause,

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the brain freezes an
image and takes a picture.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And that picture becomes the
memory embossed in the brain.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Now people tend to
think neurologically

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
within the circuits of
that past experience.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to feel within the
boundaries of those emotions,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:90%
which are chemicals.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, how they
think and how they feel

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
becomes their state of being.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can say to a person,
why are you this way?

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And they will say, I am this
way because of some experience

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that happened to
me 35 years ago.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And what they're saying
from biological standpoint--

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
that 35 years ago, they had
an event that altered them.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have not been
able to change since.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, the latest
research on memory

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.420 align:middle line:84%
says that 50% of what you
talk about in your past

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:90%
isn't even the truth.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
That memory is creative because
you don't have the same brain

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.582 align:middle line:90%
that you had 35 years ago.

00:07:53.582 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
People embellish the
memories of the experience

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to reaffirm the emotion that
they are identifying with that

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:90%
keeps them in the past.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we could
say then the person

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
is reliving a miserable life
that they never even had.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And their brain and body
neurologically and chemically

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
are being further tacked or
conditioned into the past.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so people get caught
in these loops of thinking

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and
feeling and thinking

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:90%
for 10, 20, 30, and 40 years.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And the redundancy of that
cycle of thinking and feeling

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
and feeling and thinking
conditions the body

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to subconsciously become
the mind of that emotion.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And when the body becomes
the mind of that emotion,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
now the body literally
is in the past.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.275 align:middle line:84%
And you can't create
a new future holding

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:90%
on to the emotions of your past.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, your body
is your unconscious mind.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.840 align:middle line:90%
It's objective.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It does not know the difference
between an actual experience

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.070 align:middle line:84%
in your life that's creating
an emotion and the emotion

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're creating or
fabricating by thought alone.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:84%
It means then that
your body is believing

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:84%
it's living in the same past
experience 24 hours a day,

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
To the body, it
literally is in the past.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So then to change then is to
be greater than your body,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.825 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than the
conditioning of the body

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:34.625 align:middle line:90%
living in the past.

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do most people do
once they reaffirm the thoughts

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and feelings, their
state of being that

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:90%
keep them in the familiar past?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
They start to crave
the predictable future.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So living in the
familiar past is

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
living connected to
everything known in your life.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So then what they do is they
reach for their cell phone.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:90%
They check their texts.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:90%
They check their Facebook.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:84%
They post a picture
on Instagram.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:90%
They tweet.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:90%
They check one email.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:90%
They check the other email.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They check everything
that's known and familiar

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
connected to everything

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:90%
familiar in their known reality.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And they run through a series
of automatic, unconscious

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:90%
behaviors in routine.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, a habit is a redundant
set of automatic, unconscious

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, behaviors,
and emotions

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that's acquired through
frequent repetition.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:84%
A habit is when you've done
something so many times

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that your body now knows
how to do it better

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.570 align:middle line:90%
than your conscious mind.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So if a person has been living
in the same routine for years

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
on end, their body
now is on autopilot.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's dragging
them as the mind

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:90%
into the predictable future.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And they've lost their
free will to a program.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:10%
Now it's no longer that
their personality is creating

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:10%
their personal reality.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:10%
Now their personal reality is
creating their personality.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And we can say that their
environment is controlling how

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:90%
they feel and how they think.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So then you say to a person,
why are you so upset today?

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say to you, I'm
upset because of this person

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:90%
or this thing in my life.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
really saying is

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
that person or that
circumstance in their life

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.840 align:middle line:84%
is literally controlling
their feelings and thoughts.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the case,
by very definition,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
it means then that they are
the victim to their life.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is the unconscious
program that they're living by.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So then in order
for you to change,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have to be greater

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
than the conditions
in your environment.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And every great person
in history knew this.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.290 align:middle line:84%
They believed in a
future that was already

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
so alive in their
mind that they began

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
to live as if that future
reality was happening

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And they share the same
brain as you and I.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So then to change
then, being greater

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
than your environment
means then you

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:84%
have to be greater
than the circumstances

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:90%
and conditions in your world.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're
not creating anything new

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
in your life, every
person, everything

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that's already reflected
in your brain also

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.400 align:middle line:84%
then is an experience that has
an emotion connected to it.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And we can say then
when you're thinking

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.080 align:middle line:84%
equal to your
environment, you'll

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:84%
keep reaffirming and creating
the same environment.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And finally, to change is
to be greater than time.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And if a person's living
in the familiar past,

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:90%
that is called the known.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:84%
If they're living in
the predictable future,

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:90%
that is called the known.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And to change then is to
get beyond the programs

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
of the future and the
conditioning of the past

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
and settle into the sweet spot
of the generous present moment.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
That means then you're
going to have to be greater

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:90%
than that line of time.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And there is a skill and a
formula that teach people

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.865 align:middle line:84%
how to be greater
than their bodies,

00:13:24.865 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than
the conditions

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
in their environment, and
to be greater than time.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:10%
So in order for you
to change, you're

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.895 align:middle line:10%
going to have to cross a river.

00:13:38.895 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:10%
And the hardest
part about change

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:10%
is not making the same choice
as you did the day before.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So here's the old self.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And here's the new self.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you decide
to make a different choice

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
or to do something
differently, you just

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
stepped into that
river of change.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And get ready because it's
going to feel uncomfortable.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:90%
It's going to feel unfamiliar.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
some uncertainty.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
There's going to
be some unknowns.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
you're not going

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to be able to predict
the next moment.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:84%
We just said that in
order for you to change,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
you have to be greater
than your body.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And the redundancy of thinking
and feeling and feeling

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and thinking conditions
the body into the past.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So the body has been trained
to cling to what it knows.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And now you're taking
it out into the unknown.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And the body says,
I don't like this.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't predict the future.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And the body starts
influencing our thoughts.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, we start
to have these subvocalizations,

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
this chatter in our head,
these voices that tell us,

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:90%
start tomorrow.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:90%
You'll never change.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:84%
You're too much
like your mother.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It's your ex's fault.
It's your boss's fault.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel right.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And most people listen to
that thought as if it's true.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of my greatest
moments in my life

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
is when I realized
just because I

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
have a thought doesn't
necessarily mean it's true.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So a person may say, I want to
change something about myself.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Today, no more blaming.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:90%
No more complaining.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:90%
No more suffering.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.800 align:middle line:90%
No more self-pity.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And now they're disrupting
that chemical continuity.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
two hours goes by.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Then after that
two hours, the body

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
starts craving the conditioning
of those familiar chemicals.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's the body then
that's influencing

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the mind for the
body to return back

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to the same state of being.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle line:10%
So then going from the
old self to the new self

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.470 align:middle line:10%
is the neurological, the
biological, the chemical,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:10%
the hormonal, the genetic
death of the old self.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And in that place, that void,
that place of uncertainty,

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:84%
is actually the perfect place
to create something new.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And people may say, I'm
crossing that river of change.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:90%
I can't predict my future.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is, the
best way to predict

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.002 align:middle line:10%
your future is to create it.

00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And what thoughts do you want
to fire and wire in your brain

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:90%
and put your attention behind?

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.940 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors do you want
to demonstrate in one day,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:90%
in one lifetime?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
The latest research
in neuroscience

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:84%
says that when you
close your eyes

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and rehearse an activity
mentally that your brain does

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
not know the difference between
what's going on out there

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on in here
if you're truly present.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:84%
You begin to install the
neurological hardware

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
in your brain to look
like you already did it.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Now your brain is no longer
a record of the past.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.609 align:middle line:84%
Now it's literally
a map to the future.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
You are priming your
brain into the future.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:10%
And if you keep doing
it over and over again,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:10%
firing and wiring, that hardware
will become a software program.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You just may start acting
like an abundant person.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
You may start thinking
that you're healthy.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.048 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:36.048 --> 00:17:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you installed
those circuits.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the hard part.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Can you teach your
body emotionally

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
what that future will feel
like before it's made manifest?

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:84%
That means you can't
wait for your wealth

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
to feel worthiness
and abundance.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for your
success to feel empowered.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for your new
relationship to feel love.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for your healing
to feel gratitude or wholeness.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait for the
mystical moment to feel awe.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:84%
That's the old model of
reality, of cause and effect,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.710 align:middle line:84%
waiting for something
outside of us

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to give us relief
from the emptiness

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:90%
and pain we feel inside of us.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And some people will spend
their whole life living in lack,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:90%
waiting for something to change.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you're waiting,
then you're not creating.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The quantum model of reality
is about causing effect.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start
feeling abundant and worthy,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:90%
you are generating wealth.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start embracing
the feeling of empowerment,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:84%
you are stepping
towards your success.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The moment you're in love with
yourself and in love with life,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:90%
you will create an equal.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
start feeling grateful

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and you start feeling
whole, your healing begins.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
are in awe of life,

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:84%
you will have a
mystical experience.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Now that's causing an effect.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And so from going from one state
of mind and body, the old self,

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
into a new state of mind
and body, a new self,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and crossing that
river means there'll

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
be new opportunities,
new experiences,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
new events in your life because
you're no longer the old self.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:10%
So the biological
model of change

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:10%
then is breaking the
habit of the old self

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.780 align:middle line:10%
and reinventing the new self.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It's pruning
synaptic connections

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and sprouting new connections,
no longer signaling

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the same genes in the
same way, and learning

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
how to signal new
genes in new ways.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I want you to
know is that you already

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
know how to do this.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us has done
something great in our lives.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
when we decided

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
to make up our mind
to create something

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:90%
or to do something differently?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:84%
We ask ourselves the
question, is it possible

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:90%
that I can be healthy?

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that I can
have the job of my dreams

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
or the relationship
of my dreams?

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And what would that look like?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
When you asked
that question, you

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
turned on the creative
center in your brain

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:90%
called your "frontal lobe."

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And think of your frontal
lobe as the symphony leader.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:10%
And it has connections to
all parts of the brain.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is
it naturally calls up

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
different networks of
neurons that are associated

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
with that question
based on the things

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
you've learned intellectually
in your life and the experiences

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
that you've had as well.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to seamlessly
piece them together.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
see is an image

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:90%
or a picture in your mind.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's called "intention."

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And now you are selecting a
new possibility of your future.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
When you saw that image, you
saw that picture in your mind.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
know, you started

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
to feel the emotion
as if you were

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
living in that future reality
in the present moment.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And we could say then
the moment you started

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
feeling the emotion, the
thought became the experience

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:90%
in your mind.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And you were giving
your body a sampling

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:90%
or a taste of the future.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Now here's what you
did when that happened.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You started thinking about all
the choices you had to make.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And you wrote them down.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:84%
You started to think about
all those experiences

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that would get you to that
vision, all those goals.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
wrote those goals down,

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
you felt more of those feelings.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And you kept reviewing
them in your mind

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.250 align:middle line:84%
so you can put your conscious
mind on what you wanted.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you did something
really brilliantly.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You started to write down the
thoughts that you wouldn't let

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:84%
slip by your awareness
unnoticed, thoughts like,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
I'll never change.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Those are thoughts that
if you respond to them

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
will cause you to lose
sight of your future.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And every day you
reminded yourself

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:10%
of who you wanted to be.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And every day you
reminded yourself

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of who you no
longer wanted to be.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you started seeing
synchronicities, opportunities,

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
coincidences beginning
to show up in your life.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
universe telling you

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're heading
towards a new future.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And when it finally happened, it
was no longer about the event.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.540 align:middle line:84%
It was about the fact
that you created it.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
side effect of that

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
is we become more whole,
more present, more loving

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
because now we're living
life less in lack.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:84%
There's only three
things that stop us

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:90%
from that vision of the future--

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
the body, the
environment, and time.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Number one, the body.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Most people say, I
didn't feel like it.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Or, I don't feel like it.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.710 align:middle line:90%
I have a headache.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And they use feelings as
a barometer for change.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you use feelings
as a barometer for change,

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
you'll always talk yourself
out of possibility.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:90%
The environment.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.077 align:middle line:90%
I have these people to see.

00:23:31.077 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:90%
I have these places to go.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I have these things to do.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Their environments
seduce them back

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.330 align:middle line:90%
into their present reality.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:90%
The last one is time.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:90%
There just wasn't enough time.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And people shrink
back into mediocrity.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And they find people
that do the same.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And then they use
each other to reaffirm

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
their addiction or
their conditioning

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:90%
into victimization.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So then when you're at that
lowest level in your life

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:84%
where they don't want to keep
their social engagements,

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:84%
they could actually
see themselves

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes
of someone else.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And in neuroscience, that's
called "metacognition."

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And now they're beginning
to observe their thoughts.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.382 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to
notice their behaviors.

00:24:16.382 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
the feelings that they

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.757 align:middle line:84%
were living by and
saying, I didn't even

00:24:19.757 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:90%
know I was suffering.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It just feels like
how I always lived.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And the act of observing
those states of mind and body

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
means they're no
longer the program.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Now they're the consciousness
observing the program.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
step to change.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have this basic
model of how change works,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
how do you take this
information and use

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.175 align:middle line:90%
it to create a future self?

00:24:47.175 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:84%
If where we place our attention
is where we place our energy,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
how do we direct our attention
to what we want in our life

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
instead of what we
don't want in our life?

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll dive
into demystifying meditation

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and how to find the sweet spot
of the generous present moment

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:84%
where you can begin to
create a new future.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza
for the series "Rewired."

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to see you in
the next episode, where

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:25.888 align:middle line:90%
