00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient Eastern cultures
throughout time understood

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.540 align:middle line:84%
the sacred science and the
power of the individual energy

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:90%
centers of the body.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they had
different names for them

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
that were related to the
contemporary language

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:10%
of that specific time.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, I'm sure you
heard the word chakra,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
but I question how many
people truly comprehend

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:90%
what that word actually means.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:10%
Fast forward to today, and there
are many misinterpretations

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:10%
and misunderstandings
of that simple word,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:10%
as well as many others, which
both weaken the meaning of it,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:10%
and reduce our
ability to interact

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:10%
with these mystical centers.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'd like
to take you on a journey

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
into the mystery of
your body and offer you

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
a fresh new understanding of
the different energy centers

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to show you how you can
create coherence in them, just

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:84%
like you learned to create
coherence with your brain

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
and with your heart.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.470 align:middle line:84%
In the previous
episode, we talked

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
about heart and brain
coherence and all

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.970 align:middle line:90%
of its wonderful benefits.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's build on
that understanding

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
further so you can
learn how to reprogram

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
your autonomic nervous system,
along with these individual

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
energy centers otherwise
known as chakras,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
to create homeostasis
and balance

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.046 align:middle line:84%
and restore health
back into your body.

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:33.004 align:middle line:90%

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with a brief review
of the anatomy and physiology

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
of your brain and body.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:10%
Each one of these individual
energy centers of the body

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:10%
have their own frequency.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
They carry their own
message or their own intent,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
because all frequency
carries information.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
individual consciousness.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
glands, their own hormones,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and their own chemistry, as
well as their own individual

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:90%
little brains.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sexual glands
or the sexual organs

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:90%
are related to the first center.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The digestive glands, the second
center, the adrenal glands,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the third center, the
heart and the thymus,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the fourth center, the thyroid
and the parathyroid glands,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
the fifth center, the pineal
gland, the sixth center,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and the pituitary gland,
the seventh center.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
In addition to having
their own hormones

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and glands and
chemistry, they have

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
their own individual
little brains.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Inferior mesenteric plexus,
superior mesenteric plexus,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:84%
solar plexus, or what we call
celiac plexus, heart plexus,

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
thyroid plexus, pineal
gland, and pituitary gland.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.650 align:middle line:84%
In each one of these
individual plexuses of nerves

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is a cluster of
neurons that would

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%
be like an individual brain.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And whenever energy is moving
into neurological tissue,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:90%
we begin to create mind.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So think about this, when energy
moves into your first center,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.380 align:middle line:84%
a certain set of glands,
hormones, and chemicals

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
are released and it begins
to produce its own energy.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And when energy is activating
that neurological tissue,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that center has its
own individual mind.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
By the same means,
when you're reacting

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to someone or
something in your life,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:84%
or you have to use your will to
overcome certain circumstances

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
in your life, you
activate and put energy

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:90%
in your third center.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.100 align:middle line:84%
You begin to secrete certain
hormones and chemicals as well

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
as different glands
becoming activated.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And this center, then,
has energy in it,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and when the neurological
tissue becomes activated,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
this center has a
mind of its own.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.270 align:middle line:84%
By the same means, when
energy moves into your heart,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.720 align:middle line:84%
you tend to be more loving,
more selfless, more giving, more

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
caring, more trusting,
more creative,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
because it has its
own consciousness.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And when energy moves
into the center,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:90%
we behave in different ways.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
What most people don't know
is that all of these energy

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
centers of your body
are under the control

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, autonomic
means automatic.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
autonomic nervous system

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
is part of the brain
called the limbic brain,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and its job then is
to automatically take

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
care of balance and
equilibrium in the body.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It controls blood sugar
levels, hormone levels,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.780 align:middle line:84%
it controls body
temperature, and all of that

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
takes place beyond
the conscious mind.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to review
something very simple.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
We have a tremendous
amount of energy

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%
that exists in our first center.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
There is enough energy in the
first center of a human being

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:90%
or many mammals to create life.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people have been
programmed into believing

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that energy can go
in one direction,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:90%
that we release that energy out.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But now let's take a
journey up the spine

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the brain.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
When energy is activated
in the first center,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.550 align:middle line:90%
that's creative energy.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And when that energy can
move into the second center,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:84%
if we feel safe in our
environment and there's food,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and there's shelter, and there's
protection, and there's family,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and we have networks,
energy naturally

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
moves into the second
center, and this center

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
is about consumption,
elimination, metabolism,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
breaking down food,
homeostasis and balance.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the environment
becomes unsafe

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and we perceive a threat
or danger, some challenging

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
situation, energy moves
into the third center.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And now we need our
will, and we need

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.270 align:middle line:84%
some power, become empowered
to overcome the conditions

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:90%
in our environment.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
If we're successful in
overcoming those conditions,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.375 align:middle line:84%
energy naturally moves
into the fourth center,

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and we love our life
a little bit more.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
We love ourselves a bit more.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:90%
We feel more whole.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%
We feel more complete.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:90%
We feel more present.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
have to then express

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:90%
our greatest understanding.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to express our greatest
expression of love or truth,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and energy moves
into this center.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
If we can articulate and explain
that greatest understanding,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
energy will move into
the sixth center,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and latent systems of the brain
will begin to become activated

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and we will begin to broaden
our spectrum of reality.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
we'll begin to see

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:90%
more the way reality really is.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Some veil or some
conditioning will be released.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And if energy makes it
to the sixth center,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
it'll move into
the seven, and it

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
will begin to create
harmony and balance in all

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:90%
of these individual centers.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
center right above the head.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:90%
The Egyptians called it the ka.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call that
the eighth center.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And when energy moves all the
way up to the top of the brain,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:84%
if we feel worthy enough
to receive, all of a sudden

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
now, we open this eighth center,
and opening that eighth center

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
allows the door for us to
begin to download information

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
from the field or
from the cosmos.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:10%
So it makes sense,
then, that when

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:10%
people have traumatic
events in their life,

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:10%
think about early childhood
abuse or trauma or shock,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:10%
it makes sense how
energy can get stuck

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:10%
in each one of
these energy centers

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:10%
and it never actually continues
on in making its way back

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:10%
to the brain.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
As you've learned
in the last episode,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
we have what's called
a convergent focus.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
That's when we focus on
matter, something material.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And we have what's
called a diversion focus

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
or a broad focus
or an open focus,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and that's when we put
our attention or awareness

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
on energy or nothing
but frequency.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people spend the majority
of their time narrowing

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:90%
the focus on matter.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But according to the
quantum model of reality,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
reality is both particle
and wave, matter and energy.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
introduction, in many

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of the meditations
in the work we do,

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I train people to
do meditations,

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:84%
what we called a body
parts meditation.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I ask people to
rest their attention

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:84%
on different parts of their
body and then become aware

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:90%
of the space around their body.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was tedious
in the beginning,

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
because I asked them to rest
their attention on their nose,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and then become
aware of the space

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
that their nose is in space,
and then their eyeballs

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
or the space between
their ears and then

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
the space around their head,
and all of that training

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
was preparation for
this meditation called

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
the blessing of the
energy centers meditation.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was a practice to
begin to master a convergent

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:90%
and a divergent focus.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
By the same means,
when you become aware

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
of the space around your
body, the act of doing that

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
begins to slow your brainwaves
down from beta brainwave

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
patterns into alpha and
theta brainwave patterns.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
relevance behind that?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're in beta
brainwave patterns,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:84%
you're separate
from the operating

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:84%
system where you can begin
to make measurable changes.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when you're
in beta brainwave patterns,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you're in your conscious
thinking neocortex

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're separate from the
autonomic nervous system.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:10%
So as you begin to open
your awareness and relax,

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.020 align:middle line:10%
you begin to slow
your brainwaves down,

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:10%
and that is training
for this meditation.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
As you learned, when we're under
the gun of the fight or flight

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
nervous system and the brain
and body are knocked out

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:84%
of homeostasis
because of stress,

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
the different
compartments of the brain

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:84%
begin to fire incoherently and
send a very incoherent message

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
down the spinal cord to each
individual little brains

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.120 align:middle line:84%
that are under the control of
the autonomic nervous system.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
these individual brains

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.760 align:middle line:84%
begin to fire
incoherently, and they

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:84%
begin to send an
incoherent message

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to the associated
organs and tissues

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:90%
in different parts of the body.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about this, when
this brain becomes incoherent,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
we practice opening our focus
or opening our awareness,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and the act of doing
that starts to create

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:90%
more order in the brain.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So what if you were
to rest your attention

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
in each one of these
energy centers,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and where you place
your attention is

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%
where you place your energy?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The more you keep
your attention on it,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:84%
the more you're giving it
your life force or energy.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And as you rest your attention
in each one of these centers

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and you can become aware of
the space around these centers

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
like individual beach
balls of energy,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and you move from your first
center to your second center,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
behind your navel and
slightly below it,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and that was your target, and
you tuned into its energy,

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and then your third
center in the pit

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of your gut, resting your
attention in that center

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and becoming aware of
the space around it,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:84%
as you learned in your heart
and the space around your heart,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
in your throat, anchoring
your attention in your throat

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and becoming aware of
the space around it,

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:90%
connecting to your pineal gland,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
sensing the space
it occupies in space

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and tuning into its
energy and its frequency,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
resting your attention in
the center of your head

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
where your pituitary gland
is and becoming aware

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
of the space around your head,
just like creating coherence

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, you would
begin to create coherence

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:84%
in each one of these
individual energy centers.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And when these individual
brains become more coherent,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:84%
they begin to send a
very coherent message

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to all the cells and tissues
and organs of the body.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can understand then that
so many people heal themselves

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
of so many different
health conditions

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
because they understood what
they were doing and why.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
It has taken some
time for people

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to practice both convergent
and divergent focus.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
It takes some time for people to
learn how to regulate and slow

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:84%
their brainwaves
down so they can

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.550 align:middle line:84%
begin to reprogram their
autonomic nervous system.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So all of the training that
we've done up until this point

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to practice
creating coherence

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
in each one of these
individual energy centers.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, we've seen
people heal from rectal cancer,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
prostate cancer,
enlarged prostate,

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
impotence, we've seen them
heal from uterine fibroids,

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
uterine tumors, ovarian cysts,
diverticulitis, indigestion,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
acid reflux, high liver
enzymes, heart palpitations,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
arrhythmias, heart disease,
thyroid conditions, thyroid

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:84%
tumors, brain tumors,
depression, anxiety,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
all different health
conditions, once we

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
learn how to create
coherence in each one

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of these individual
energy centers.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the beauty
behind it is that you

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
don't have to spend a
whole lot of time doing it

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
once you know how to do it, and
we begin to ascend our energy

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to create balance
in each individual energy

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the word
called ligand or ligar,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.300 align:middle line:90%
meaning to bond.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:84%
There are three types
of ligands that you

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:90%
have in your brain and body.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The first type is called
neurotransmitters.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And neurotransmitters
communicate chemically

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:90%
between neurons.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They are chemical
messengers that

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
send different messages
in the nervous system.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The second type of ligand
is called neuropeptides.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And neuropeptides are
chemical messengers

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that begin to signal
hormonal centers.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So then once a neuropeptide is
released from the limbic brain,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
has a very specific
target, and that target

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
goes to the individual
hormonal centers.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
The ligand then begins to
activate the hormonal system

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to release
certain chemicals.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So then if a person is
thinking certain thoughts,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
like they're suffering,
or they're in pain,

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:84%
or they feel guilty,
they'll begin

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
to activate different
neurological networks

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
in their brain
that are connected

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:84%
to different
experiences of the past.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:84%
The moment they begin to turn
on enough neurological networks,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
neuropeptides are created,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and now we begin to signal
different hormonal centers

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
for us to begin to feel exactly
the way we were just thinking.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So now that neuropeptime makes
its way to the second energy

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
center in the body and the
person starts to feel bad,

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
or the person starts
to feel guilty,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:84%
or the person starts to
suffer, or the person

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:90%
starts to feel unworthy.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Now they're feeling exactly the
way they were just thinking.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start
to feel those feelings,

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
of course, the brain
checks in with the body

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
and generates more
corresponding thoughts

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
equal to the way
you were feeling.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:10%
So now over time then, we keep
taking energy and storing it

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:10%
in these lower energy
centers of the body.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And now the job is to begin to
create balance and equilibrium

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:10%
in each one of these
energy centers.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at the
first three energy

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
centers of the body.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
The first three energy
centers of the body

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:90%
are energy consumers.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when you begin
to feel certain emotions that

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:84%
are related to the first
three energy centers,

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
we're drawing from
the field and we're

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:90%
using energy to make chemistry.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
When we start getting to
our fourth energy center,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
this center and above begins to
release energy or cause energy

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:90%
to move out.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So then when we blast the
energy centers of the body,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
when we rest our attention
in each one of these energy

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
centers and you tune into
its frequency or energy,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to rest your
attention in these centers,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want you to
feel them with your head.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel them with
each one of those energy

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:90%
centers.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I asked
you to rest your attention

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
in your fifth center and I asked
you to tune into its frequency,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I would want your mind to
be in your throat and tune

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
into the energy of that center.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:84%
When you tune into
those energy centers

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and I ask you to
tune in and receive,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
drawing from that field

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.665 align:middle line:84%
and creating coherence in each
one of those individual brains.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:10%
Coherence is order.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:10%
It's health.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:10%
Incoherence is disease
or a lack of balance.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:10%
And if you can put
a coherent signature

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:10%
over an incoherent
energy, coherence

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:10%
will begin to
entrain incoherence,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:10%
and when that happens
properly, all of a sudden now

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:10%
when there's total coherence,
we would call that a healing.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So then the formula
for doing this

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.619 align:middle line:84%
is putting your attention
in your first center,

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of
the space around it,

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:84%
tuning into its
energy and receiving.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:20.660 align:middle line:10%
Then moving your attention
to your second center,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:10%
finding it, feeling it,
paying attention to it,

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:10%
staying present with it
and tuning into its energy

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:10%
and its frequency.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And the longer you're
conscious of this energy,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
the more you're
drawing from that field

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and creating coherence
in that center.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Then you put your attention
in your third center

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
in the pit of your gut
and tune into its energy

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and tune and receive
its frequency,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and so on to the fourth, the
fifth, the sixth, the seventh,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.840 align:middle line:90%
and finally, to the eighth.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to the
eighth, all I want you to do

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
is become aware that you're
up in this space up here

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:90%
and tune into its energy.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion that
I want you to feel

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:90%
is gratitude when you do it.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Because gratitude
represents receiving.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And all I want you to do
is feel worthy to receive.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:10%
And then you'll go to
this invisible field

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:10%
around your body, that
field called the true self,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:10%
tuning in to your own energy.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's back up here with
a little bit of physics.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
When atoms come
together and they bond,

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:90%
they begin to exchange energy.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you exchange energy,
you exchange information.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't see
that individual field.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the
field around the atoms.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's that energy that's
holding the atoms together.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Once those atoms
form a molecule,

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
they begin to
behave differently.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
boiling point.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
specific gravity.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:90%
They have a different weight.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.840 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the
atoms coming together

00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to form a molecule take on
different characteristics.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep adding
more and more atoms,

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:90%
you'll begin to form a chemical.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's an invisible field
of energy and information

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that's holding that
chemical together.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
If you take enough chemicals and
you assemble them into order,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:90%
you can create a cell.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And now the cell has its
own individual energy,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:84%
its own light and
information that's

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:90%
literally instructing the cell.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And the latest research
in information biology

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
says that it's not charged
molecules randomly instructing

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
the cell, but it's the
cell's light and energy

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that's allowing the cell
to have its instructions.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
The more coherent that light is,
the better the cell functions.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you put a group
of cells together,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:90%
you'll begin to form a tissue.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And each individual
tissue of your body,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the community of cells will
begin to emit its own light

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and information.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And the more coherent
the cumulative light

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and information
from that tissue,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense then the higher
functioning that tissue is.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
You take that tissue
and you twist it over

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and you form an organ.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the organ has its
own individual field

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:90%
of light and information.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And we could say that in that
field of light and information,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.000 align:middle line:84%
it's instructing the organ
because that energy has

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So we know this to be the
case because when there's

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
been heart transplants
or organ transplants,

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:84%
in a matter of days, the
person with the new heart

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
begins to crave the very food
that the donor craved when

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
he or she was alive,
which means then there's

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:84%
an awareness of that organ,
and now it's being integrated

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:90%
into that person's field.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And because there's a
memory in the field,

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
it begins to change the person's
expression in their body.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
You put organs together, you
form what's called the system.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And you could have your
musculoskeletal system.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
You could have your
cardiovascular system.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
You could have your
lymphatic system,

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:90%
your reproductive system.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:10%
And each individual
system of the body

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:10%
has its own individual energy,
frequency, and information.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, take all the systems of
the body and put them together,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and now the body has an
invisible field of light

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:90%
and information surrounding it.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And that field of
light and information

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the body
is the true self.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:84%
That we are not matter,
we are energy using matter

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:90%
for the expression of life.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So then the more you react
to people and conditions

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
in your life, the more
you're consuming energy.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're over eating,
whether you're overstressed,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:84%
whether you're
over sexual, we're

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
going to be drawing
from this field,

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and over time, we're going to
diminish our own light field.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So as we climb up this
ladder all the way to the top

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to
put our attention

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.120 align:middle line:84%
on the field around
the body, what you

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:90%
put your attention on expands.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So then we finish the
blessing of the energy centers

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
meditation by becoming
aware of that light field

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
around your body and tuning
in to your own energy.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And the more orderly
and coherent that

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:84%
field around your body, the
more orderly the patterns

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
of information, the more your
body can draw from life force.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we're giving
the body its life again.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We are causing the body
to become more energy.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the more matter
we are, according

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to the second law of
thermodynamics, the more matter

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:90%
turns into disorder.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
It's called entropy.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the more
you feel like matter

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and the less you
feel like energy,

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
the more you're subject to the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
which says things move towards
disorder if they're material.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're experiencing
separation because

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of the hormones of
stress, it makes sense

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
from an energetic
standpoint how the body can

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.790 align:middle line:90%
begin to break down.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're creating coherent
energy around your body,

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.750 align:middle line:84%
then you will experience
what's called syntropy.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And syntropy is the
reverse of entropy.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It means now energy
is organizing matter.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And the more syntropic our
energy, the less likely

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:84%
we are going to fall victim of
entropy or three-dimensional

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:90%
decay over time.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:84%
In our workshops, we have
done extensive measurements

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
with an instrument
called the Bio-Well.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:10%
And the Bio-Well
was created by a man

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:10%
named Konstantin Korotkov.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Think of the Bio-Well as
a sophisticated Kirlian

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:10%
photography machine.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, what it's measuring is
the excitation of photons.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
When energy is
enhanced in the body,

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
there's a release of light.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking
at the body's ability

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
to release or organize the
light, and at the same time,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
we're measuring the energy
centers of the body.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.120 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking for is
the relationship of how

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
these energy centers
line up with each other

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
size of the energy

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
centers to determine if
different systems are working

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.830 align:middle line:90%
cooperatively with one another.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at this
lessening of the energy centers

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.970 align:middle line:84%
The premeasurement
before the meditation,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.270 align:middle line:84%
you could see the person has
some balance in certain energy

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
centers and an
imbalance in others.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the
end of three days,

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
the change in both the
alignment as well as

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
the size of the energy centers.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Now take a look at this one.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:10%
There's a dramatic imbalance
in the fifth energy center,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:10%
the six energy center,
the second energy center,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:10%
the seventh energy center.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And now take a look at just
three days of meditation.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Not only is there
more of an alignment,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:84%
but there's also more
energy in each center.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, that doesn't look too bad.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Persons not too out of balance.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But take a look what
happens after three days.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a healthy, balanced
autonomic nervous system.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is before.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at after,
just a few days later.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:10%
But take a look at the person's
energy field around their body.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
You could see in
the before example

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
there are certain
areas where there

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:90%
is a weakness in the field.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Three days later, there
is a dramatic change

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.680 align:middle line:84%
in the amount of
light and information

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:90%
this person is emitting.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
They have more energy as a
result of the meditation.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is before.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You can see some issues
with the seventh center.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You can see some with the fifth
center, the second and third.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And look at the change
in size, as well as

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%
the change in alignment.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:90%
This is before.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Very imbalanced fourth,
third, and second center.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a look at just
three days of blessing

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:90%
the energy centers.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.400 align:middle line:90%
This is the energy field before.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the dramatic
change in the energy

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:90%
around this person's body.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
They are emitting more
light and information,

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:84%
or better yet, they're more
connected to the field.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is before.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.860 align:middle line:90%
This is after.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, take a look at the energy
around this person's body.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:84%
You could see,
just in three days,

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
this person has a beautiful
coherent field around her body.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.810 align:middle line:90%
There's energy to heal.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There's energy for
growth and repair.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.960 align:middle line:84%
This person has a
lot of life force.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So I said to Dr.
Korotkov when he

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
came to one of our events
to study our work, I said,

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
how long does it typically
take to see a dramatic change

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
in the field like
we're witnessing here?

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, many times, it
takes six to eight weeks.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The person has to fast,
eat very little food,

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
has to sleep a lot, has to take
care of themselves and do yoga,

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and over time, they begin
to build their field.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And now we're seeing that
this can happen in a shorter

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
amount of time, because
it's the mind that's

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:90%
literally influencing the body.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we can do that
is to change our brainwaves

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
and focus our attention on
each one of these centers

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and the field around the body.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:84%
To demystify this chakra
system or the energy centers,

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
that there's a material
component to them

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and an immaterial component to
them, and they are very real.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And as people begin to
get better and better

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
at reprogramming
them, they begin

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:84%
to notice significant changes
in their health, as well

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:44.423 align:middle line:90%
as their life.

00:27:44.423 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have a
better understanding

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
about the different energy
centers of your body

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and how to reprogram your
autonomic nervous system,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:84%
it is my hope that you'll
use this information

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to create more harmony
and balance in your body

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
so that you prove to yourself
how powerful you truly are,

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.990 align:middle line:84%
that you need less influence
from something outside of you

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.750 align:middle line:84%
to be healthy, and that
you understand that you

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.050 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to change your
inner state by thought alone.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this whole
series has been

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
created to inspire you to apply
this information to your life.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And who gets to reap the
benefits of your efforts?

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:90%
You do.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Then your family
and friends, then

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.410 align:middle line:84%
the people you work
with, then finally,

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:90%
the community in which you live.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
this series, we've

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:84%
learned how you can harness
the innate power of your mind

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to create a new future.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
We explored aspects
of the brain,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics, the
mind-body connection,

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:90%
as well as the placebo effect.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We discussed the difficulty
of change and the difference

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
between living in survival
and living in creation.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:84%
You learned how to activate
latent systems in your brain

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to induce a
mystical experience.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:84%
We started to demystify
the power of meditation

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and how this daily
practice can help

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:84%
you achieve all the
richness that this life has

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to offer you.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe
Dispenza for "Rewired,"

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And remember, all of us have the
potential become supernatural

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:84%
with a little understanding of
how extraordinary we truly are.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:90%
