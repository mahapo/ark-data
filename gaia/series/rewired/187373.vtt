>> It has been said
that the brain thinks,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.370 align:middle line:90%
but the heart knows.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:90%
[HEART BEATING]

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 10 years,
my research team and I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:84%
have gone to great
measures to teach people

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:84%
how to sustain both brain
and heart coherence.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you begin to understand
the value of how your heart

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and brain can work
together to not only change

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
the health of your body,
but to influence your life,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
It's my hope that you'll begin
to apply some of these concepts

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the last two episodes

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:10%
we demystified the
mystical into a deep study

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:10%
of the pineal gland and
its sacred metabolites that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:10%
induce a transcendental moment.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I want
to help you understand

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
how your heart dramatically
influences your brain

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.316 align:middle line:84%
and how brain coherence begins
to open the door to your heart.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's first start with how
the brain and the heart

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:90%
both become incoherent.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:10%
If you remember from
previous episodes,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.550 align:middle line:10%
coherence represents order,
rhythm, synchronization.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Incoherence is a lack of
order, or disintegration.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
the brain, when you

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:84%
react to someone or
something in your life,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you turn on that primitive
nervous system called the fight

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:90%
or flight nervous system.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
When the body and brain become
aroused because of the release

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
of these stress hormones,
the rush of adrenaline

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:84%
begins to cause us to become
more alert and more aware.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540 align:middle line:84%
The arousal causes us to put
our attention on our bodies,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
on all of the elements
in our outer environment.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And what is our
environment made of?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
People, objects,
things, and places.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And when we're under the gun
of these stress hormones,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:90%
we're preoccupied with time.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, where you
place your attention

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:90%
is where you place your energy.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, then, all
of our attention and energy

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
is invested into this
three-dimensional reality,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and we have to play by the
rules of Newtonian physics.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you learned,
everything takes time

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
to happen in this
three-dimensional world.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Under these stress hormones and
the arousal of those chemicals,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the brain moves into a
brainwave state called

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:90%
high beta brainwave patterns.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And in this state
of survival, we

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
try to control and predict
everything in our lives.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we
shift our attention

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
from one person
to another person

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to another person
to another problem

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
to another place to
another object or thing.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And every one of those elements
are already neurologically

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:90%
mapped in our brain.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:90%
In other words, every person--

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:84%
like your boss, your co-workers,
your partner, your kids,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
your cell phone, your computer,
where you work, where you live,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:90%
where you sleep--

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
every one of those elements
has a neurological network

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain is aroused
because of those stress

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
hormones, as we
shift our attention

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
to each one of those
different elements

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:84%
in our external environment,
we activate the associated

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:90%
neurological networks.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, the brain
begins to fire incoherently.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
When your brain is
incoherent, you're incoherent.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So then, the hormones
of stress cause

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
us to narrow our focus on
the danger, or the element,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that's causing the
stress reaction.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we are
narrowing our attention

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:90%
on the material world.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So then we begin to
experience separation

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
because our senses
fool us into believing

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're separate from
everyone and everything

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
arousal of these hormones,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.000 align:middle line:90%
we become materialists.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And the material world
then, under the gun

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
of the fight or flight
nervous system, in this state,

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.160 align:middle line:90%
it's not a time to create.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time to
open your heart.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to learn.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to communicate.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to meditate.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time to sit
down and be vulnerable.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a time to run,
to fight, or to hide.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So then people
habituate in this state,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and they live 70% of the time
under the hormones of stress.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the same
time, the heart is

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
racing because the person
is living in survival.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And when the heart
is racing, the body

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
is prepared to run,
to fight, or to hide.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not running,
if you're not fighting,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and if you're not
hiding or freezing,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a staff
meeting, or you're in traffic,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
it's like stepping on the
gas pedal as your heart races

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and stepping on the brake
at the exact same time.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And when that
occurs, when there's

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.640 align:middle line:84%
incoherence in the
brain and the heart,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
there's less energy in
the brain and the heart.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, every single
one of those elements

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
in your external environment
is a known to you

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
because you've
experienced them already.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And because you've
experienced them already,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
you have a neurological
network in the brain.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
By the same means,
if you experienced

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:84%
each one of these elements
in your environment,

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.980 align:middle line:84%
you have a feeling, or an
emotion, associated with them.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, the stronger
the emotion you

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
have to those different elements
in your external environment,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
the more you pay
attention to them.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So if where you
place your attention

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is where you place your energy,
you are giving your vital life

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
force and your power away
to all of those elements

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:90%
in your external environment.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
we have no energy

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
in our inner world for
thoughts and feelings

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
to create anything new in our
life if all of our attention

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:90%
is on everything null.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And over time, we begin
to create a connection

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
energetically with
everything known

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:90%
in our past, present reality.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:10%
And they're predicting their
future based on the past,

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:10%
and they can't relax
into the present moment.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
If you remember from
previous episodes,

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
we have this invisible field
of vital life force surrounding

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.625 align:middle line:84%
us, this invisible field
of light and information.

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And as we respond to some
stressor in our lives,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
we draw from this
invisible field of energy,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to turn
it into chemistry,

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and the field around
our body shrinks.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Come more matter and less
energy, more particle and less

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
wave, and now we are forcing,
controlling, predicting,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
fighting for, manipulating
outcomes, competing for them

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.190 align:middle line:84%
because we're matter
trying to change matter.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
The brain stays highly aroused
in those high beta brainwave

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
patterns, and the person
has an incoherent brain,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and now they are disconnected
from their dreams.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They're disconnected from
everyone and everything

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
in their life, and
they're relying

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
on something outside of them to
take away those feelings that

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:90%
are created inside of them.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
waiting for something

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
to change in their
life, then they're

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
not creating anything
new in their life.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
effects of incoherence.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:10%
When you have two waves
that are coming together

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:10%
and those waves are incoherent,
are not synchronized,

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:10%
when they begin to interact
or interfere with one another,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:10%
they begin to create
a change in energy.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:10%
In other words, when waves are
out of sync or out of order,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.720 align:middle line:10%
and they begin to
interfere, we begin

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:10%
to diminish the amount of energy
in the brain and in the heart.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:10%
When waves are
coherent, and they're

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:10%
synchronized, as they begin
to interfere with one another,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:10%
over time, they will begin
to create bigger waves.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
The more synchronized the brain
is, the more coherent it is,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
the more coherent the heart
is, the higher the amplitudes,

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:84%
the higher the energy in
the brain and the heart.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense
then, when there's

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:84%
incoherence in the
brain and when there's

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
incoherence in
the heart, there's

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
less energy in the
brain and the heart.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
The more coherence
that's created

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.650 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and the
heart, the more energy

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:90%
we have in the heart.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
We started to investigate
these principles to see

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
if we would be able to create
more brain coherence and heart

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
coherence and measure those
changes that could take place.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:10%
So then if a person's
living addicted

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:10%
to the hormones of stress, and
they are narrowing their focus

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:10%
on everything material, that's
called a convergent focus.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
That's when we narrow our
focus on the material world.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And people habituate and
get stuck in the state.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, what
if we taught people

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
how to go from a narrow focus,
focusing on the material world,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
to a broad focus,
or to an open focus,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
or what's called
a divergent focus?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Divergent focus-- instead
of a convergent focus,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:10%
taking your attention
of the material world

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:10%
and putting your attention
on nothing material putting

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:10%
your attention on
energy and frequency.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Would it begin to change the
way the brain functioned?

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, that
became the formula for us

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to begin to record high
amounts of brain coherence.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:90%
And the process is very simple.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.700 align:middle line:84%
You ask the person
to close their eyes,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to take a few breaths,
to relax their body.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, I asked them

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to sense the space on both
sides of them and how far can

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:84%
their awareness go into
that endless space,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to sense the infinite black
space out in front of them,

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
giving it depth and
becoming aware that there's

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:90%
infinite space behind them.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And as they take their
attention off the material world

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and begin to put their attention
on that field of energy

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
or information, by
opening their focus

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to sense
space, they're no longer

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
analyzing and thinking.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And because they're no longer
analyzing and thinking,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.080 align:middle line:84%
they're no longer
activating those circuits

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
in their brain that are
connected to everything known.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And as they're
closing their eyes

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and sitting still in the
meditative state, over time,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
they forget that
they have a body.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They forget that
they are connected

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:90%
to people in their lives.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They're no longer thinking about
their cell phone or their car

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.335 align:middle line:90%
or their computer.

00:11:01.335 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:84%
They're not even
aware of where they're

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
sitting, where they need
to go, where they sleep,

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:90%
where they work.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And they literally lose
track of time and space.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they
fall into the sweet spot

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:90%
of the generous present moment.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:10%
When it's done properly, if
you're no longer activating

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:10%
these circuits in the brain,
and you're no longer analyzing

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:10%
and thinking, we begin
to slow our brainwaves

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:10%
down from those beta
brainwave states into alpha.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to cross
that analytical mind.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're not just looking
for any type of alpha.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
We started noticing that the
brain started getting very

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:90%
organized and very coherent--

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
a very coherent form of alpha.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And if the person was capable
of continuously relaxing

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and falling further into
the present moment, all

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, their brainwaves
move into a coherent theta

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%
brainwave state.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And in theta now, there's
very little activity

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:90%
in the neocortex--

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:84%
the seat of your identity,
the seat of the known self--

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, we
disconnect from our body,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
our environment, and time.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And we become no body, no
one, no thing, no where,

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and no time, and
that is the moment

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.730 align:middle line:90%
we become pure consciousness.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Remember, coherence is order.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:84%
If we're measuring 19 different
compartments of the brain

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and each one of those waves
are synchronized and organized,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and the valleys line
up with the hills,

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:84%
we could say that the
entire brain is coherent.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.970 align:middle line:84%
When you have 19
compartments of the brain,

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're not synchronized,
and some are firing out

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of order, if we were to
measure those heights

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and peaks and valleys, it
would no longer be organized,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:90%
and that would be incoherent.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.962 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this brain scan.

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
strip chart, and we're

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:84%
measuring 19 different
compartments of the brain.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the person's in
a low beta brainwave pattern.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, we asked them
to open their focus.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We asked them to begin to
connect to that unified field

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and put their
attention on nothing.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And as their brain
begins to slow down,

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and they shift
from beta to alpha,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
take a look at the
amount of coherence

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
that's taking place in
this person's brain.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to see that all of
those 19 different compartments

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
are on the same rhythm.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:90%
They're on the same beat.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The entire brain is
phase synchronized.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Here's another person.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at their brain
when they open their focus

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and they put their
attention on nothing.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The entire brain is phase
synchronized into an alpha

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:90%
brainwave pattern.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a high
amount of coherence.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the
higher the coherence,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:84%
the higher the
energy in the brain.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at this brain--

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
another example where the brain
is completely synchronized.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Every single compartment of the
brain is on the same channel,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and the brain is functioning
in a more holistic, organized,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:90%
integrated state.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Now in this brain scan,
we can see a person now

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:90%
in theta brainwave patterns.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
This is the state where the body
is falling asleep or resting

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:90%
and the mind is awake.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the person
has completely switched off

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
the sympathetic nervous
system, and now they're

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:84%
functioning in a very slow state
of the parasympathetic nervous

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.090 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is where regeneration
and growth and repair

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
begin to happen because
now, the person is

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
conscious in their
subconscious mind.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
They are connected to the
autonomic nervous system

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.230 align:middle line:84%
because they've gotten
beyond their conscious mind

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:90%
in high beta brainwave patterns.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And now they're in
the operating system

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
where they can begin to make
the most important changes.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how we
create heart coherence.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
When a person is
living in stress,

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're out of
balance, their heart

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:90%
is always racing a little bit.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And over time, people begin
to condition their heart

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:90%
to race like that all the time.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:10%
And if you keep creating
that kind of incoherence

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:10%
in the heart, where
it's no longer

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:10%
beating in a rhythmic
fashion, the disintegration

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:10%
of the interference of
those individual frequencies

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:10%
diminishes energy in
the heart, and now we

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.180 align:middle line:10%
stop trusting ourselves.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:90%
We stop trusting in our future.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is
the creative center.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.890 align:middle line:84%
The heart represents
the union of polarity,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the union of duality,
the union of opposites.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:84%
This is where our
divinity begins.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
If you can teach a person
how to open their focus

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and begin to become no body,
no one, no thing, no where,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and no time, and begin to
open up into that blackness,

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that quantum field where
there is nothing physical,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and out of all the things they
can put their attention on--

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
instead of putting it on their
cell phone or their Facebook

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:84%
or the co-workers or their boss
or their ex or the problems

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.090 align:middle line:90%
in their lives--

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
they're taking all
of their attention

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
and placing it on their heart.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And where you place
your attention

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
is where you place your energy.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, you are putting
attention and giving your heart

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
life, the very
life force it needs

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:90%
to begin to bloom like a flower.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So as you rest your
attention in your heart

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to keep
your attention there,

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:84%
the next step is to slow
your breathing down,

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and then you breathe in
and out of your heart.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing is
you're working with your body

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:84%
so that it feels safe enough to
relax into the present moment

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and switch from the
sympathetic nervous system

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if a person
is aroused constantly,

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take some
practice to begin to do this.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to breathe in
and out of your heart slower

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and deeper and more relaxed,
as your breathing slows down,

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
your brainwaves slow down.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:84%
And now the person
now is starting

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
to slip right into the
autonomic nervous system

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:90%
and into the operating system.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's trade the
emotions of guilt, of shame,

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:84%
of unworthiness, of pain, of
suffering, of anger, of fear,

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
of hostility, of
judgment, of envy

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
for heart-centered
elevated emotion.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe,
give yourself

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:84%
permission to begin to feel
gratitude, appreciation.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Begin to feel thankfulness,
a love for life,

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:84%
a joy for existence, but
doing that independent

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:84%
of any condition in your
external environment.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, so many people
are conditioned into believing

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.300 align:middle line:84%
they need a reason
for gratitude,

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:84%
they need a reason for joy,
they need a reason to feel love,

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
they need something
outside of them

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
to create that emotion
inside of them.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And here, we're doing
the exact opposite.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning
to open our hearts

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and begin to put
energy in there.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
breathe and feel

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
these elevated emotions,
all of a sudden,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the heart starts to
become more coherent.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And like dropping pebble
in very still water--

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:84%
pebble after pebble after pebble
in a very rhythmic fashion--

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
the heart begins

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to produce an ambient
magnetic field that

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:90%
can be up to three meters wide.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, like beating a
great drum, frequency that's

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
being created from the
heart, that frequency

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:90%
can carry information.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And now the person, once
energy moves into their heart,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
they're in the perfect
state to create it.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
In other words, once this
creative center opens up,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and once it begins to
become more coherent,

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
not only are you producing that
magnetic field that's beginning

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:90%
to spread out from your body--

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
you're becoming more energy
and less matter, more wave

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and less particle--

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll begin to feel like you're
connected to something greater.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And when your heart
is open, you're

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.500 align:middle line:84%
no longer experiencing
lack, polarity, separation,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:90%
or duality.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.530 align:middle line:90%
You feel connected.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Your body begins to believe
when you train your heart

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that your future is actually
happening in the present moment

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
because you're experiencing
the emotion of your future

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:90%
before it happens.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You can place the thought of
your new life, your new job,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
your new relationship, your
healing, the new opportunity

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:90%
in your life--

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that energy can carry the
thought of your future.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:84%
The energy of suffering, the
energy of guilt cannot carry

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:90%
the thought of your healing.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It cannot carry the
thought of your abundance.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:84%
That frequency of suffering
carries a different set

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:90%
of thoughts.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, once the heart
is open, it immediately

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:90%
begins to influence the brain.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
As the heart becomes
more coherent,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's more
energy in the heart,

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
it automatically begins to
amplify energy into the brain.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And now we have more
energy in the brain.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs,
we start thinking

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
with a different
level of awareness,

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
a different set of thoughts, a
different consciousness that's

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.590 align:middle line:90%
equal to those emotional states.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
moment you feel unlimited,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to think
unlimited thoughts.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The moment you feel
worthy, you are going

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.758 align:middle line:90%
to think different thoughts.

00:20:35.758 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And those thoughts
are going to begin

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to make more chemicals for you
to feel more heart coherence.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel that
more heart coherence,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:84%
your brain's going to
check in with your body,

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to generate
more corresponding thoughts.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And in time, you will begin
to change your state of being.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
When people can sustain
heart coherence,

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
just for a short
amount of time, there's

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.680 align:middle line:84%
a resetting that takes place
in the baseline of trauma.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
When people have traumatic
events in their life

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that are shocking, that are
related to betrayal or loss,

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:84%
we begin to become
branded emotionally.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And that trauma stays right
in the survival center

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
of the brain called
the amygdala.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But as we begin to
reset our inner state

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to self-regulate,
when the heart begins

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to open up and energy
moves to the brain,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
there are fibers
that run right up

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:84%
to the amygdala that begin to
reset the baseline of trauma.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of moments,
a person starts

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:90%
to feel more like themselves.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a look at what heart
coherence and incoherence

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:90%
looks like.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the
top graph, this

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:10%
is a person who's
feeling frustration,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:10%
anxiety, impatience,
fear, and you

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:10%
can see that the heart is
completely out of rhythm.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at the second graph.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
When the person is feeling an
elevated emotion like gratitude

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or appreciation or
kindness or care,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
look at the amount of
coherence, or rhythm or order,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
that's taking
place in the heart.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, elevated emotions--
like gratitude, love, joy,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
inspiration, peace, wholeness,
trust, knowingness, patience,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:90%
empowerment--

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:25.300 align:middle line:84%
are selfless emotions that
tend to open the heart.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:10%
The survival emotions
that we've been talking

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:10%
about over the last
several episodes

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.890 align:middle line:10%
are related to those
emotions of guilt and shame

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:10%
and unworthiness
and anger and fear.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing to do with
heart-centered emotions.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:10%
So then what if,
then, the heart begins

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:10%
to become more coherent and
it begins to send energy up

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.990 align:middle line:10%
to the brain through these
fibers called afferent fibers?

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve,
the primary nerve

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.630 align:middle line:84%
that's dominant in the
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:84%
begins to reset the
baseline of the brain.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the heart
becomes coherent,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:90%
the brain becomes coherent.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain starts
to become coherent,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.940 align:middle line:90%
the heart becomes coherent.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
And how do we know that?

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look
at a brain scan,

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and we see a person
beginning to become

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.330 align:middle line:84%
more orderly in their
brain, we see the front

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of the brain
beginning to resonate

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:90%
with the back of the brain.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
We see different communities of
neurological networks beginning

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to form larger
communities, and they begin

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:90%
to oscillate and resonate.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you see the left side

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:84%
of the brain talking to the
right side of the brain.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And if the person is connecting
to that unified field,

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the signature of
order and unity is

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
beginning to become entrained
in the nervous system.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.870 align:middle line:84%
When this occurs-- when you
see the union of opposites,

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
the union of polarity,
the union of duality--

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden, when those
two hemispheres come together

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and there's that psychic
union, in that moment when

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the person feels
whole, the heart

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.490 align:middle line:84%
begins to function
more coherently.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So then a coherent brain begins
to produce a coherent heart.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And a coherent heart
amplifies energy

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:90%
and creates a coherent brain.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So take a look at this
person right here.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Each one of these
individual squares,

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:84%
these individual blocks,
represent five minutes.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is a person
in a meditation,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and we're asking that
person to begin to elevate

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:90%
their emotional state.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And for a little over 50 minutes
you can see from this graph

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that they're sustaining
an extended period of time

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:90%
of heart coherence.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a look at this last
period of heart coherence.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:10%
Now this is the
interesting thing.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:10%
This person was
not in a meditation

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:10%
when she was experiencing
this level of heart coherence.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her,
what were you doing?

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.640 align:middle line:84%
She said, I was
finishing up my day.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:90%
I was unpacking.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
It was 8 o'clock at night,
and all of a sudden,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere, I felt this
incredible feeling of love

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:90%
take over me.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
She said it was so intense,
it was so powerful,

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that she had to lay
on her back in bed

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and just surrender
to the feeling.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And for over an hour,
she's relaxing into love.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And 1,400 to 1,300
different chemicals

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
are released in this state that
begin to restore and repair

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:90%
the body.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know what
a panic attack is.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
When a person keeps selecting
the worst-case scenario

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
in their mind, and
they begin to become so

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
preoccupied with
that probable outcome

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that they start to feel the
emotions before it happens,

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.260 align:middle line:84%
they're combining an
image, or a thought,

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:90%
with a feeling and an emotion.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And over time, they're
conditioning the body

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:90%
to become the mind of fear.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And if they do
that enough times,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
the body is going to
have a panic attack.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Try as they may to control
it with their conscious mind,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:84%
they can't because they
programmed it subconsciously.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, take a look at this--

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:84%
three people sustaining heart
coherence for 45 minutes.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:10%
These people are developing
the skill of self-regulation,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.960 align:middle line:10%
and I want them to be able to do
it with their eyes open as well

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:10%
as their eyes closed.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
They should be able to
do it in their life.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And they should be able
to notice when they lose

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:90%
that feeling from their heart.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And they should be able
to excuse themselves

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.590 align:middle line:84%
from their day, or from
certain conditions,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.720 align:middle line:84%
and begin to
recalibrate and begin

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.790 align:middle line:90%
to open their heart again.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And in time, then,
they're going to become

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:84%
less reactionary to everyone
and everything in their lives.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not
reacting, then they're

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:90%
no longer living in stress.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And now the body can begin to
regenerate and repair itself

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's now no longer
living in emergency mode.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a look
at these people.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.140 align:middle line:10%
This is a person with a
really weak heart, very little

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:10%
variability.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And take a look-- for a
little over 15 minutes,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:84%
this person is able to
sustain heart coherence.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.150 align:middle line:10%
For another 8 minutes or so,
they're able to do it again.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And to me, this is the
beginning of a person changing

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.730 align:middle line:90%
their biology.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:10%
Another person,
very weak heart--

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.760 align:middle line:10%
for about six minutes, they're
able to create heart coherence.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And again, for about
seven or eight minutes,

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:10%
they're able to do it again.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:10%
And if they keep
practicing this,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:10%
they're going to change their
biology and begin to make it

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:10%
a skill.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is the significance
of creating brain and heart

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:90%
coherence?

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.480 align:middle line:84%
When you create heart
coherence, you're

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:84%
emitting a measurable
magnetic field.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
When you're creating
brain coherence,

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
you can put a thought or
intent on that frequency.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it
properly now, you

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
are broadcasting a very coherent
signature of electromagnetism

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:90%
all around you.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Once you create a coherent
signature in the brain

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and heart, now,
like a laser, you

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
can begin to the decode
information in the field.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And being able to control those
frequencies, or your awareness

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:84%
in connecting to
those frequencies,

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:84%
now it's like having a Wi-Fi
signal where you can connect

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:25.260 align:middle line:90%
to energy and information.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:84%
When the brain is incoherent,
when the heart is incoherent,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.530 align:middle line:84%
we experience separation,
and we have a poor signal,

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
so we can't connect to
the field to create from.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And as the person begins to
trade those survival emotions--

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:90%
like anger and fear or pain--

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.040 align:middle line:84%
for elevated emotions-- like
gratitude and joy and love--

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and they overcome
the emotions that

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:84%
keep them bound to their
past, present reality,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's no longer
a vibrational match

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.690 align:middle line:84%
between anyone or anything in
their life, all of a sudden,

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:84%
as they overcome the
emotions, they're

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:84%
going to take their attention
off the person or problem.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're going
to begin to weaken

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:84%
the energetic bonds with
their past, present reality.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, if they're no
longer feeling those emotions,

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and they're no longer thinking
about that person or problem,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.320 align:middle line:84%
they are taking
their power back.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.130 align:middle line:10%
And they begin to build their
own electromagnetic field.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, they have
energy to heal.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Now they have energy to
create a new future with.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And now they're
creating no longer

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:90%
from lack or separation--

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.820 align:middle line:84%
they're creating from
wholeness or oneness.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when
they create they

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.500 align:middle line:84%
feel like it's
already happening.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And so then when we get
up from our meditations

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:84%
in this creative
state, as long as we're

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
feeling the emotions of
our future in our heart,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.990 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer looking for
when it's going to happen

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or why it's going to
happen because you feel

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:90%
like it's already happened.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And you are connected to
the energy of your future.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we lose the
energy of our future,

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and we disconnect
from it, now we're

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:84%
back to the energy of our
past, and don't expect anything

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.490 align:middle line:90%
to change in your life.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough to just
do this in your meditation.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to sustain this
modified state of mind

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:90%
and body our entire day.

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So then when there's
a vibrational match

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.310 align:middle line:84%
between your energy and some
future potential that already

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
exists in the quantum field, and
you're creating from the field

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:84%
instead of from matter,
now we no longer

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.310 align:middle line:90%
have to go anywhere to get it.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We will begin to
collapse time and space

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and draw the experience to us.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, we'll begin
to believe that we're

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
more of the creators
of our lives instead

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
of the victim of our lives.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've shown you how
to create heart and brain

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.900 align:middle line:84%
coherence, it's my
wish that you'll

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:84%
use this information to
synchronize your mind

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.670 align:middle line:84%
as well as your heart to
better manage your energy.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.750 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we're going to discuss

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.570 align:middle line:84%
one of our community's
favorite meditations.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It's called the blessing
of the energy centers.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:84%
This meditation
in particular has

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:03.300 align:middle line:84%
healed a host of many different
health conditions-- from brain

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:84%
tumors to asthma to thyroid
conditions to prostate issues

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to vertigo to depression,
just to name a few.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Dr. Joe
Dispenza for "Rewired,"

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see you in
the next episode, where

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.830 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.580 align:middle line:90%
