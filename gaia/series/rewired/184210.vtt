00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Stress can be defined as a
state of mental or emotional

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.020 align:middle line:84%
strain or tension resulting
from adverse or very demanding

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:90%
circumstances.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But how do different
kinds of stress

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:84%
cause long-term effects
on our brain and body?

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Stress usually is
created when we

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
can't predict a
future outcome, when

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.638 align:middle line:84%
we feel that we can't
control a situation,

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
or when we have the
perception that there's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
a threat, a danger,
or a perception

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that something's going to
get worse in our lives.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
You may not be able
to control everything

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that happens in your
life or your outer world.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.780 align:middle line:84%
However, is it
possible that you can

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
learn how to control your inner
world of thoughts and feelings?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:10%
And in the previous
episode, we went into depth

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.490 align:middle line:10%
on the ancient
practice of meditation

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:10%
and what it means
to be truly present.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're
going to identify

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of stress,
show you the long-term effects

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
of stress, how it can
create illness in your body,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.508 align:middle line:84%
and once you understand
what stress can do to you,

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
it's my hope that the
information you learn

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
will empower you to make some
important changes in your life.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%
There are three types of stress.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:10%
There's physical
stress, chemical stress,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:10%
and emotional stress.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, physical stress are
things like traumas, accidents,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:90%
injuries, falls.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Chemical stress-- flus,
bacteria, viruses, blood sugar

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:90%
levels, toxins in food.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Emotional stress-- family
tragedy, second mortgages,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:90%
single parenting, traffic jams.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of these different
stressors, whether they're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
physical, chemical,
or emotional,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.150 align:middle line:84%
knock your brain and
body out of balance.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
definition of stress

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is when your brain and body
are knocked out of homeostasis.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the stress response is
what your body innately does

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:90%
to return itself back to order.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
When you or any
organism in nature

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
begins to perceive
a danger or a threat

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
in their external
environment, they

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
turn on a primitive
nervous system

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
called the fight-or-flight
nervous system.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And when the person
or the organism

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is perceiving that
danger, the body innately

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
begins to mobilize
enormous amounts

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of energy and resources.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
All of its energy now
is being mobilized

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to be able to adapt to the
stress in the environment.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So then, we begin to tap
the body's vital resources

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
so that we can survive the
condition in the outer world.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
All organisms in nature can
tolerate short-term stress,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.810 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a zebra
being chased by a lion,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a pack of
coyotes chasing a deer.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The moment the organism
perceives that danger

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and switches on that
emergency system,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
there is a rush of adrenaline
and a rush of energy,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and there is an
arousal that takes

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
place in the brain and body.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And those chemicals, then,
alter our normal homeostasis.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that state
of survival, we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
switch on that sympathetic
nervous system,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
or what's called the
fight-or-flight nervous system,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and our pupils dilate, our
salivary juices shut down.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a time to eat.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Our heart rate increases.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Our respiratory rate increases.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:10%
Blood is sent to
the extremities,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:10%
and it's shut down in
the internal organs

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:10%
because it's a time to
run, it's a time to fight,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.920 align:middle line:10%
or it's a time to hide.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, if the zebra or the
deer outrun the predator,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:10%
30 minutes later, the stress
response begins to switch off,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.100 align:middle line:10%
and the body returns
back to balance.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.920 align:middle line:84%
After there's a stress
response, many organisms

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
need to rest and repair
because the body has

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to come back online and
regenerate and conserve energy.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:84%
What if, though, you're
being chased by T. rex,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're turning on that
primitive nervous system

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
called the fight-or-flight
nervous system?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
perceive that threat

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and you're in danger
and now you're

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
running from the predator,
that's very adaptive.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But what if, then, the predator
is waiting outside the cave

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for you to
go out and get some food?

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
We could say, then,
that your ability

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
to sustain a certain stress
response would be extended.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But what if it isn't T.
rex outside the cave?

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:90%
What if it's your co-worker?

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
What if it's your mother-in-law?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:90%
What if it's your boss?

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:90%
What if it's traffic?

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And what was once
highly adaptive becomes

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:84%
very maladaptive, because when
you turn on the stress response

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and you can't turn it off,
now you're headed for disease.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Because no organism
can live in emergency

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
mode for an extended
period of time.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Reason this with me.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
If you keep mobilizing
enormous amounts of energy

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
for some threat in
your outer world,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:84%
there's no energy in your inner
world for growth and repair.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So think of the
sympathetic nervous system

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
as the emergency system that's
like the gas pedal in the car.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The other nervous system called
the parasympathetic nervous

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
system, that nervous system
is the nervous system

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, of
regeneration, of metabolism.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is living in
a constant state of stress

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and they, like an addict,
become conditioned

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to the rush of the arousal of
those chemicals, then in time,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
then, they will begin to use
the problems and conditions

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
in their life to reaffirm their
conditioning or their addiction

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.340 align:middle line:90%
to that emotion.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
We become so conditioned
to these chemicals

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that, like a drug addict,
we need the bad job,

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
we need the poor relationship,
we need the difficult situation

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in our life to keep getting
that rush of adrenaline,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to keep getting
that rush of energy.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, people
become addicted to the life

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
they don't even like.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So then because of the
size of the neocortex--

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:84%
the thinking brain,
as you learned about--

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
we can make thought more
real than anything else.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And people can begin to
think about their problems.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And as they begin to think
about their problems,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:84%
they can turn on the stress
response just by thought alone.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that those
chemicals can become addictive,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and you can turn on the stress
response just by thought alone.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So then, you can become
addicted to your own thoughts.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's a scientific fact
that the long-term effects

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
of the hormones of stress
push the genetic buttons that

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
create disease.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can turn on the stress
response just by thought alone.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.540 align:middle line:84%
It means, then, that your
thoughts can literally

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:90%
make you sick.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And so many diseases
around the world

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.500 align:middle line:84%
now are created by the immune
system being suppressed,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:84%
or what we call
immune-mediated diseases.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything from cancer, MS,
lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
food allergies,
food sensitivities

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
is a compromise in
the immune system.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:90%
So here's the question.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
If your thoughts
can make you sick,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that your
thoughts can make you well?

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, we did a research study
where we took 117 people,

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:10%
and we wanted to measure
their cortisol levels, which

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:10%
is the stress hormone,
and another chemical

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:10%
called IgA,
immunoglobulin A. It's

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:23.060 align:middle line:10%
your body's primary defense
against bacteria and viruses.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So as cortisol levels
go up and you're

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
mobilizing enormous
amounts of energy

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
for some threat in
your outer world,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
the immune system dials down.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And now the immune system
becomes compromised

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
because all of the
energy is going

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:90%
for a threat in the outer world.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Our immune system
becomes suppressed,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:90%
so typically IgA levels go down.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So we measured the
cortisol and IgA levels,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and we put them through
four days of training.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And we asked them
to trade emotions

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
like anger and
frustration and hatred

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
and violence and aggression
and competition and fear.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Those are all the chemicals
that are derived from the stress

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:90%
hormones.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:84%
We asked them to trade
those survival emotions

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:84%
for elevated emotions, heartfelt
emotions like gratitude,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
appreciation, kindness,
care, love for life,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%
a joy for existence.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And all we wanted them to
do for 10 minutes a day

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.120 align:middle line:84%
was open their hearts
and begin to feel

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:90%
those elevated emotions.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
At the end of 3 and
1/2 days, we went back

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and we re-measured
those same values.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:90%
And their immune system--

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that is, IgA levels-- went
up as a collective about 50%.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:10%
Their cortisol levels
dropped about 16.25%.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Their stress hormones went
down, and their immune system

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.530 align:middle line:90%
up-regulated to a great degree.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
That means, then, when you begin
to make a change in the way

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:84%
you think and the
way you feel and you

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
begin to change your
attitude and you

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
begin to open your heart again
and feel an elevated emotion,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
it is those elevated
emotions that

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:84%
begin to restore and
repair the immune system.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So then, there's
three things when

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:84%
you're living by the
hormones of stress

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:90%
that you keep your attention on.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Think about it-- if you're
being chased by a predator,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
all of your attention is
on your outer environment.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going to go?

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
What place do you
need to move to?

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
What object do you
need to move past?

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you're under the
gun of those chemicals,

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:90%
you're thinking about time.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
How much time do I
have to get there?

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So then, the body, the
environment, and time.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And if where you place your
attention is where you place

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:84%
your energy, it makes sense,
then, if all of your attention

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
is on your body, all
of your attention

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
is on your environment, and all
of your attention is on time,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
then you are putting
all of your attention

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.720 align:middle line:84%
in this three-dimensional
reality.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Now you have to
play by the rules

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of this three-dimensional
reality.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And everything that you
create will take time.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
When people are under the
gun of those chemicals,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.780 align:middle line:84%
they're drawing from this
invisible field of energy

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
surrounding their body,
this vital life force,

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're using it
to make chemistry,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and the field around
their bodies shrinks.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And they become more matter
and less energy, more particle

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:90%
and less wave.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And the very hormones of
stress heighten our senses

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.730 align:middle line:10%
so that we become a materialist.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more altered we feel
from that stress response

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
or by the emotional reaction
from some threat or danger,

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
the more we narrow our focus
on the cause or the object.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
all of a sudden

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:90%
we are focusing only on matter.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And so people over time
get hooked in or habituated

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:90%
into narrowing their focus.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So then when you're
living in emergency mode,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:90%
it's not a time to create.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time to
open your heart.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time to
learn anything new.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not a time to sit
still and go within.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if the survival
gene is switched on,

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
you'd be thinking at
some level innately

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that it's not a
time to sit still,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:90%
because you would be prey.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So then, the more people
are conditioned or addicted

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to the hormones of
stress, the more

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
their attention is
on matter, the more

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
they begin to
experience separation

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:90%
from everyone and everything.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if stress is
created by the feeling

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that you're losing
control in your life,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
predict an outcome,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
or you have the perception that
something or someone is causing

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
situations in your
life to get worse,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:84%
then if you're living by
the hormones of stress

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis,
then what we try to do

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
is we try to control
everything in our life

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
when we're feeling
loss of control.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
We try to predict
the next moment based

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:90%
on our memories of the past.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:84%
That means people under
stress are craving the known.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get back
to the familiar or the

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
known because in survival,
the unknown is a scary place.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So then, as they begin to shift
their attention from one person

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to one problem to another
person to another problem

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
to another thing
to another place,

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:84%
each one of those elements
has a neurological network

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And the arousal of
those chemicals,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
then, begin to cause
those different circuits

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:84%
as you shift your
attention to begin

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to become highly activated.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And now the brain is functioning
in a very incoherent state.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And the arousal
of those chemicals

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:84%
drives the brain into a
very, very highly analytical,

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:90%
over-focused state.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.343 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:13:38.343 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
When you're under
stress, have you

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
noticed that you keep thinking
about the same problem over

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and over again, because
the very hormones of stress

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
cause you to narrow
your focus on a cause,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
because that's what you do
when you're living in survival.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, out of the
infinite possibilities that

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
exist in your reality,
when people are addicted

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
or living in that
stressful state,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
they'll always select
the worst-case scenario

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.265 align:middle line:84%
in their mind and
prepare for the worst.

00:14:06.265 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, why is that?

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Because in survival if
you prepare for the worst,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
anything less that
happens you have

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:90%
a better chance of surviving.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.633 align:middle line:84%
So people spend the majority
of their life preparing

00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
for the worst thing that could
happen to them when they're

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
living in a stressful state.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that 70%
of the time, most people

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.020 align:middle line:90%
are living in survival.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So then when you react
to someone or something,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
there's a refractory
period of chemicals

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that's created from
your emotional reaction.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
how to regulate or stop

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.370 align:middle line:84%
that emotional reaction and
you keep that same reaction

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
lingering for hours or
days, that's called a mood.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
If you keep that same
refractory period

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
going for weeks
to months on end,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:90%
that's called a temperament.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
If you keep that same
emotional reaction

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
going on for years
on end, that's

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:90%
called a personality trait.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And most people's
personalities, then,

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
are defined by
experiences from the past.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.010 align:middle line:10%
So now that you
understand that stress

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:10%
is when the brain and body
are knocked out of balance

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:10%
and you understand that
the harms of stress

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:10%
push the genetic buttons
and create disease,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.150 align:middle line:10%
it begs the question, is
there anyone or anything

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:10%
truly worth living
in that state?

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So then, if people are
living in chronic stress

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and they're drawing from this
invisible field of energy

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:84%
surrounding their
body and they're

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
mobilizing that vital life
force to make chemistry

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and the field around
their body is shrinking

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're feeling more like
matter and less like energy,

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:84%
more like particle
and less like wave,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and they feel separate or
disconnected from everyone

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and everything in
their life, well,

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
when you're matter
trying to change matter,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
we tend to force outcomes,
control outcomes,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.020 align:middle line:90%
try to predict outcomes.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's only a certain
number of resources

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have when we're matter
trying to change matter.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:10%
We'll compete, we'll fight
for it, we'll manipulate,

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:10%
we'll try harder,
we'll hope, we'll wish,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:10%
because we're
experiencing separation.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you may
accomplish your dreams.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're matter
trying to change matter

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and all of your attention is
on your body, the environment,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and time, then everything
you create in your life

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:84%
will take time, because
you'll have to move

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:90%
your body through space.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you move your
body through space,

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take time for
you to get what you want.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So you may want a house,
you may want a new car,

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
you may want a new
experience, a new vacation,

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
have to drag your body

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to work every day to make the
money to pay for those things.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you may
arrive at your goals,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:84%
but you may have to
work harder and it

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.569 align:middle line:90%
may take some time to get it.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.390 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
There is another state of mind
and body that you can live in,

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and that's called
living in creation.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's the exact opposite
of living in survival.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:10%
If the hormones of stress
create incoherence in the brain

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:10%
as well as incoherence in
the heart, what we've found

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:10%
is that when people are living
by those states, what if they

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:10%
had the ability to go
from a narrow focus

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:10%
or what's called
a convergent focus

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:10%
to what's called a divergent
focus or a broad focus

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:10%
or an open focus?

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out when
people take their attention

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:10%
off their body, when they take
their attention off the people

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:10%
in their lives, when
they're no longer

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:10%
putting any attention
on the things

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:10%
they own, like their cell
phone, their computer, the car,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:10%
they're not thinking about
the place they need to go

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.310 align:middle line:10%
or the place they're sitting,
and they're not thinking

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:10%
about time in and of itself.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
They are disinvesting
all of their attention

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and all of their energy out of
this three-dimensional reality.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
no attention on it,

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense, then,
that they're beginning

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:90%
to change their brain state.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.325 align:middle line:10%
So then, we've taught people
how to broaden their focus.

00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they open their
focus and sense nothing

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
but space, when they
open their awareness

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and they tune in to the energy
or the frequency out here,

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and instead of putting
their attention on matter,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
they're putting their
attention on energy,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:84%
the act of opening
their awareness

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
causes them to stop
thinking, to stop analyzing.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And if they're no
longer thinking

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're no longer
analyzing, they're

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle line:84%
no longer activating these
circuits in the brain.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, they begin
to slow down brain activity,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and they start getting
beyond their analytical mind.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And as they suppress the
neocortex, the memory

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
bank of the
autobiographical self,

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
they begin to
suppress everything

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
known in their
three-dimensional reality,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and they turn off
the neocortex, they

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.610 align:middle line:84%
begin to regulate their
brainwaves and slow them down,

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden something
magical happens.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
The act of opening
their awareness

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:84%
causes different compartments
of the brain that

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
were subdivided like a house
against itself, all of a sudden

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
to begin to synchronize,
to begin to unify.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
You start to see neurons
beginning to join

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:90%
larger communities of neurons.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And what was once
an incoherent brain

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:84%
begins to become more
organized and more coherent.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, the chronic stress creates
a thyroid condition called

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Grave's disease, and the
person develops what's

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:90%
called myasthenia gravis.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect of that,
aside from a tremendous lack

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:90%
of energy, is double vision.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Now this person said, I've
created this condition now

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that I understood
that I've mismanaged

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
my thoughts and feelings
and my emotional reactions.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
If I created this condition
by pushing the genetic buttons

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:90%
every single day--

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's taken me a couple
years, I lost my marriage,

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I lost my business--

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to get beyond
that story, and I

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:90%
have to tell a new story--

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I have to start
believing in my future

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
more than I've been
believing in my past--

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
is it possible, then,
that I can begin to make

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.990 align:middle line:90%
those significant changes?

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And as the person started
overcoming the stress hormones

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and taught her brain and
body how to create coherence,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
the side effect of it was the
body came back to balance.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Her vision is now perfect,
her thyroid hormones

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:84%
are moving back into balance,
and she's moved her brain

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:90%
and body back into homeostasis.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, then, she
healed herself of the condition

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:84%
because her autonomic
nervous system got back

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
into doing its job, which is
to create order and balance.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So then, when we live in
two states of mind and body,

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
living in survival is
living in our animal state.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:10%
When we live in survival,
we live in stress.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we live
in stress, there's

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
contraction that takes
place in the body.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And because we're using a
lot of the body's resources,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we experience what's
called catabolism,

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:90%
or tissue breakdown.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.000 align:middle line:84%
When the body's in that state,
there's dis-ease or imbalance,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:84%
there's degeneration that
takes place in the body.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The emotions of fear,
anger, and sadness

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
are the primary
emotions of survival.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.848 align:middle line:90%
The self comes first.

00:21:38.848 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:10%
When you're living in that
state, all of your attention

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:10%
is on your environment, all of
your attention is on your body,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:10%
all of your
attention is on time.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
There's always energy
lost in the system.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:90%
We're living in emergency mode.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:10%
We're narrow focused
or object focused.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:90%
We experience separation.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
We're determining
reality with our senses.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:10%
In other words, if we can't
see it, if we can't smell it,

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.110 align:middle line:10%
if we can't taste it,
if we can't hear it,

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:10%
we can't feel it,
it doesn't exist.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.430 align:middle line:10%
We're living by
cause and effect.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:10%
We're waiting for
our environment

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:10%
to change to give us the
relief from the discomfort

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:10%
that we're feeling inside of us.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:84%
In survival and in stress, we
don't see many possibilities

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.400 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
a time to create.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:84%
The brain and heart function
in a very incoherent state.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And in survival we
are craving the known

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
because the unknown is just
too much of a scary place.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we begin to
create the creative state,

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
we could call that the
divine aspect of us.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.590 align:middle line:10%
In creation, the brain and body
move back into homeostasis.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:10%
There is an expansion
of energy, a release

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:10%
of energy from the tissues.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The body goes into
anabolism, or tissue repair.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:10%
There's health, there's
order, there's regeneration

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:10%
taking place in the body.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.890 align:middle line:10%
Elevated, heartfelt emotions
like love, joy, trust,

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:10%
knowingness, gratitude
begin to mobilize

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:10%
all these new chemicals that
begin to repair and regenerate

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:10%
the body.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
When we're in this
heartfelt state,

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
we tend to be less
selfish and more selfless.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.010 align:middle line:84%
We have our attention now
no longer on our body,

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
on the things in our life,
the people in our life,

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
on our environment,
or on time itself.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Energy is always created
in the creative process.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.430 align:middle line:90%
There's growth and repair.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
We broaden or open our focus.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.210 align:middle line:10%
And when we do that
properly, we start

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:10%
feeling less separate and more
connected to something greater.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:84%
We start to imagine and dream
of a reality beyond our senses.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Now we're interested
in causing an effect.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:10%
We're looking at all
possibilities instead

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:10%
of limited possibilities.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
The brain and heart
go into coherence,

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and now the unknown
becomes the adventure.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're going to create
something new in our life,

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.012 align:middle line:90%
we have to crave the unknown.

00:23:58.012 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've shown you the
difference between living

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:84%
in survival and
living in creation,

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to explore the
different brainwave states

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and what you can
do to use your mind

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to begin to consciously
change your own brainwaves.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
I want to show you

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:84%
what's happening inside your
head when you live in survival

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and when you live in
creation-- that is,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:90%
coherence versus incoherence.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe
Dispenza for "Rewired,"

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see you
in the next episode

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
where we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:38.294 align:middle line:90%
