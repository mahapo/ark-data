00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Physicists, great thinkers,
and philosophers in history,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:84%
as well as brilliant
scientific minds,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
have spent their entire lifetime
striving to understand how

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:84%
an invisible field of
energy and information,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
as well as the forces of nature,
unify the material world.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
I want to demystify
the realm of matter

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:10%
and introduce you to a roadmap
on how to connect to a realm

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:10%
beyond our senses
that you can only

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:10%
arrive at as an awareness,
or pure consciousness,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:10%
dissociated from
everything material.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The world of space-time is
the realm in which we live.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's our known universe.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
The world of time-space cannot
be experienced with our senses,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and its principles and
laws transcend the laws

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:90%
of three-dimensional reality.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
In this realm beyond
space and time,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
there are other laws that
once you understand them,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
it will help you to create
from the quantum field,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
instead of from
matter, producing

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
greater effects in your life.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the previous episode

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:10%
we journeyed into the
quantum model of reality.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.260 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I want to
further your understanding

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of energy, frequency, vibration,
information, consciousness,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and the realm of thought.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Take a look around you, and look
at everything in this material

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:10%
You can see everything that
has form and structure that's

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:10%
material, and it has
height and depth and width.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And because everything material
has height and depth and width,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
we call this our
three-dimensional world.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And the world of
matter we can only

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:90%
experience with our senses.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's talk about time.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.810 align:middle line:84%
We experience time
in a very linear way,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
because we have a definite
past that you can remember,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and the past is a series
of separate moments,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and those heightened
emotional moments become

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:90%
the definition of our past.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.775 align:middle line:84%
Once we live in the
past in linear time,

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment, as
the brain is an anticipation

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:84%
machine, we're always trying
to anticipate the future.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we have
a linear line of time--

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
what physicists
call a world line.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
So then we remember the past.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:90%
We can predict the future.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And we experience time
as something very linear.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
In this realm of the senses,
where we experience separation,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that separation can be defined
as duality, or polarity.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:84%
If I'm standing
here and I notice

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm separate from
something over there,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
if I want to move from
one point of consciousness

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
to another point
of consciousness,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
if I'm local as a
body, I have to move

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
my body in
three-dimensional reality

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
from one point of awareness
to another point of awareness.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I begin to move through
space, or collapse space,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I experience time.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.833 align:middle line:10%
So then because I'm separate,
I have me here and you there,

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:10%
and if you look
different than me,

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:10%
or you appear as
something unfamiliar,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:10%
I experience more separation.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And by the same
means, if I'm here

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and I have my dreams
somewhere in my future,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
my brain automatically
calculates

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
how long it's going to take
for me to arrive at my dreams.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's see-- took me this long
to make this amount of money.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I have to go to my job,
maybe work some overtime

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to pay my bills to
get what I want.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And so as we begin to set goals
for ourselves, we have dreams.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:90%
We have visions of our future.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
The way that we get them is
we move our material body

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
through space.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
And it means
everything takes time

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
in this three-dimensional
reality.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
And this is the realm
of Newtonian physics.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The Newtonian world
has everything

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to do with the known,
or the predictable.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.170 align:middle line:10%
And because of Newton and
his mathematical equations,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:10%
we can begin to understand
that everything in the material

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:10%
world can be predicted.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:10%
So then Descartes,
back in the 1700s,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:10%
was very interested
in understanding

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:10%
the realm of matter and
the realm of the mind.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And what he did was he
separated everything material

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
and put it into the
world of science,

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:84%
or what we call the
sphere of science.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was
part of the mind

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.270 align:middle line:84%
was too convoluted
and too unpredictable,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and he left that to the church--

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:90%
the sphere of religion.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
As Descartes created
this duality between mind

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and matter, when Newton
came along and discovered

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:84%
his scientific formulas,
he basically proved

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Descartes' theories
that the outer world,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
the large universe,
was very predictable.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about
polarity and duality

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
is we create from polarity
and duality all the time.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:10%
If you took away sight, hearing,
smelling, tasting, and feeling,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:10%
you would have no experience
of the three-dimensional world.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:10%
So think of your senses
as something that plug you

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:10%
into three-dimensional reality.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:84%
By the same means,
when you begin

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to interact in
your external world

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and you see something
that you want,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you notice
that you don't have it

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
creates separation.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So because you don't have
it, you experience polarity,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:90%
or duality.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing we do is we
start to think about, or dream

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
of getting it.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we start to
think about and dream

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
of some future, the
next thing you know,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:84%
you see yourself
experiencing that future.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you come
back to your senses

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and the object or the
experience isn't there,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:90%
we experience more separation.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, throw in the hormones of
stress, the hormones of stress

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
heighten the senses and
cause us to focus more

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:90%
on the material world.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we always try to force
outcomes, control outcomes,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
predict outcomes, fight for
outcomes, manipulate outcomes.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So then if you want to
get what you want faster,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
what you're going
to do is to move

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:84%
from one point of consciousness
into your future, your dream--

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:90%
another point of awareness.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And what most people
do is they move faster.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So if they think that they're
moving faster through space,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:90%
that it'll take less time.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
People are rushing all the time
in a program into a future,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
and never enjoying the moment.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So this world of
the senses is where

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you develop your
personality, your identity.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And that personality
and identity

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is basically the memory
bank of your neocortex--

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:90%
the known self.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we are going to
create from the field

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
instead of from
matter, then we have

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.460 align:middle line:84%
to disassociate from
everything known

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:90%
in this three-dimensional world.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to dissociate
from everything material

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
in this
three-dimensional reality

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and we begin, in the meditative
process, to close our eyes

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and disconnect from
the environment,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond our bodies and
fall into the present moment

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and move out of that timeline
of the predictable future

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and the familiar
past, the moment

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:84%
we can become nobody, no
one, no thing, no where,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and no-- time that is the moment
where taking our attention off

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:90%
of everything known.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you continuously
work for that present moment

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and open your awareness, as
you keep doing that and sensing

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
space, sensing energy,
sensing nothing material,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
the act of opening
your awareness

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:84%
begins to slow your
brainwaves down

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:90%
in your thinking neocortex.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not thinking
about your back pain,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking
about your problems,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking
about your coworkers,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking about all
the errands you need to run,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking
about your cell phone--

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.960 align:middle line:84%
if you're no longer activating
those circuits in your brain,

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
as you suppress this
neocortex-- the memory bank

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%
of your identity--

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
you move from beta
brainwave patterns

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.275 align:middle line:90%
to alpha brainwave patterns.

00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And as the brain
starts to integrate,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
as the brain starts to
become more coherent,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and as the heart starts to
resonate in more balance, all

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden now,
your brain slows down

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:84%
into low alpha, and
ultimately into theta.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.420 align:middle line:10%
And in theta, there's
very little activity

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.830 align:middle line:10%
in your thinking brain.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:10%
And in a sense, the door
between the conscious mind

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.130 align:middle line:10%
and the subconscious
mind is wide open,

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:10%
and you are conscious in
your subconscious mind.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And in this realm, we call
this the fourth dimension.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:10%
Because Einstein said
E equals mc squared.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:10%
When you take matter
and you bring it up

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:10%
to the speed of light, it's
going to turn into energy.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So the ceiling of this
three-dimensional reality

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:90%
is the speed of light.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you become
nobody, no one, no thing,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
no where, and no time,
that's the moment

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:90%
you're no longer your body.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the moment you're
no longer your identity.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the moment you've
dissociated from everything

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
known, and that is the moment
you are pure consciousness.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, you
are on the bridge--

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%
the door to the quantum field.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
This is when you become
transcendent of your identity.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.895 align:middle line:84%
We call this getting
beyond the self.

00:09:57.895 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.610 align:middle line:10%
When we get beyond ourselves,
we move from a narrow focus--

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:10%
an object focus-- to what's
called an open focus,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:10%
or a broad focus.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:10%
We take our attention off
of everything material--

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:10%
objects, things, people, places.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:10%
That's the particle
in quantum physics.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:10%
And we begin to open our
awareness to space, to energy,

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:10%
frequency, to information--

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:10%
the wave in quantum physics.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:10%
We move from the
material world of matter

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:10%
to the immaterial
world of anti-matter.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:10%
We move from the
3D Newtonian world

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:10%
to the fifth-dimensional
quantum world.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:10%
We move from the realm of
the predictable to the realm

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:10%
of the unpredictable.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.950 align:middle line:10%
We move from the realm of
space-time to the realm

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:10%
of eternal space to the
realm of time-space--

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:10%
a realm where
there's eternal time.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We move from a state of
separation, duality, polarity--

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
or what we call locality--

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to a state of unity, oneness,
wholeness, non-locality.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing material there.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:10%
The realm of the known to
the realm of the unknown,

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:10%
from limited possibilities
to unlimited possibilities,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:10%
from the universe
to the multiverse,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:10%
from the domain of the senses to
the domain beyond the senses--

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:10%
and that's the realm
we want to create from.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Once you move through
this eye of the needle,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:90%
you can't bring your problems.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:90%
You can't bring your disease.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:90%
You can't bring your pain.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to get beyond
all of those things

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and enter as pure consciousness.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Now you can enter the
realm called time-space.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, time-space is an
interesting concept,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
because in this realm of
three-dimensional reality,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
there's an infinite
amount of space.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Space is eternal.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And as we've been saying,
we experience time

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
as we move through space.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:84%
My material body experiences
three-dimensional reality,

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and as I move through
space, I experience time.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum, this
realm of time-space,

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
there is an infinite
amount of time.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Time is eternal.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about this.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
What could you
accomplished in your life

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
if you had an infinite
amount of time?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
If time was eternal,
you could get

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
everything done you needed to
get done, and many more things.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
As long as you can think of
them, as long as you could

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
come up with a new
possibility, you

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:90%
could get that done as well.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you had an
infinite amount of time,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
you'd have infinite
number of possibilities

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:90%
that you could accomplish.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:90%
And that is the quantum world.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:90%
There's so much time.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Time is so eternal
that all possibilities

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:90%
exist in the eternal now.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this realm, you can't
experience it with your senses.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:84%
You can only experience it
with your consciousness,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:90%
or your awareness.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the realm of
frequency, of energy,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:90%
of vibration, information.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:10%
This is the realm where you
transcend everything separate,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:10%
and you begin to experience
oneness, wholeness, connection

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.660 align:middle line:10%
to something greater.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
In this realm of time-space,
you've transcended space-time.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So in this realm,
there is no space.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, if there is
no space, then I

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
can't move from one
point of consciousness

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to another point
of consciousness,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.960 align:middle line:90%
which means there is no time.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is beyond
space and time.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:84%
There's one, long,
present moment.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you create from the
field instead of from matter,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
you can exert greater effects
on the nature of reality.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the
realm of thought

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and there's no separation,
then every single thought

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:90%
that you think has a frequency.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thinking
thoughts that

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:84%
are connected to emotions
like anger or frustration

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
or pain or suffering or
guilt, those thoughts

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:90%
produce a slower frequency.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And because they produce
a slower frequency,

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that causes us to feel more like
matter, and less like energy.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have to, in
this realm, manage

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts and our awareness.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Every single emotion
produces a frequency.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:10%
And the slower the frequency,
the slower the vibration,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:10%
the slower the
outcome in manifesting

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:10%
three-dimensional reality.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:10%
The faster the
frequency, the more

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.770 align:middle line:10%
elevated the emotion,
the closer we

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:10%
are getting to
the unified field.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And what we tell our
student body to do

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.830 align:middle line:84%
is to tune into a frequency
of wholeness and oneness.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Become more aware of it.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Stay connected to it
moment by moment by moment.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
As they begin to open
their awareness and tune

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
into this frequency,
once they can feel it,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
once they can
experience it, once they

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
can become more aware
of it, every time

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
they have an
experience of it, they

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
begin to lay down
circuits in their brain

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to begin to perceive
more of it the next time.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, they're
wiring their brain

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to become connected to
that invisible field.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So how much of your waking
day are you aware of matter,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and how much of your
waking day are you

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
aware of energy and information?

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Most people put all of
their attention on matter,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:84%
so their brain is wired
for the material world.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the quantum field--
if you're unaware of it,

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.540 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist for you.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you're trying to
experience it with your senses,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
then you're in the habit
of looking for something

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:90%
from this material world.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's breaking the habit and
being able to, as an awareness,

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:84%
linger in this field and
begin to connect to it.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And then ask yourself, is
there more love to experience?

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Is there more oneness, more
wholeness to experience?

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And just like listening to
music and paying attention

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
to the subtleties, or becoming
more aware of something,

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.980 align:middle line:84%
as you become more aware
of these frequencies,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.830 align:middle line:84%
every experience that
you have brings you

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:90%
closer to that unified field.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, when your consciousness can
begin to merge with the greater

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:84%
consciousness--
the consciousness,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence of
that unified field--

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:84%
when you continue to surrender
some aspect of your limited

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
self to join the greater self,
if you can surrender completely

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and let go of your identity
and become more of it

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and less of you, if you were
to continue this process--

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:90%
now, think about this.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been saying that in
this realm of space-time,

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:84%
the separation of two points
of consciousness creates time.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the more you're connected
to this unified field,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and if your consciousness
is completely connected,

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:84%
or surrendered or dissolved
into a greater consciousness,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and there's no
separation between two

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:84%
points of consciousness,
then there is no time.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Which means, then, if you're
creating from the field

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
and you're connected to this
frequency, or to this energy,

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:84%
now you no longer play by the
rules of Newtonian physics

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:90%
where everything takes time.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Now you're playing
by the quantum.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you're creating from that
energy called source energy,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:84%
from the unified field that
is connected in organizing

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:84%
everything material, then
you can exert greater effects

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.020 align:middle line:90%
on the nature of reality.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And now, when you're
connected and you're

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
creating from the field,
you're no longer trying.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.220 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer wishing.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.510 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer wanting.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer hoping.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:84%
You feel so whole you feel
like it's already happened.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you're creating from the
field instead of from matter,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.960 align:middle line:84%
now you're beginning
to warp space and time,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and the event comes to you.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to
do, then, is create

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
a vibrational match
between your energy

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and some potential
in the quantum field,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and it only requires
two things--

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:84%
a coherent brain,
and a coherent heart.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, if every thought
has a frequency

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're creating
from lower frequencies,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
then you're creating
from duality or polarity.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Once you get energy
into your heart--

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and we said all along that this
is the center that connects you

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to the field.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Once the heart begins to
beat in a coherent way,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
you start feeling connected
to something greater.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you can create
a clear intention

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with a coherent brain,
that's the signal

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:90%
that you're sending out.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, every thought
has a frequency,

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.240 align:middle line:84%
so if you're beginning to create
with the frequency of falling

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:84%
in love with your
creation, feeling grateful

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
that it's already
happened, beginning to bond

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:90%
and connect with your future--

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:84%
if the feeling draws
the event back to you,

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
as long as you can
bond and connect

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
to that emotion
in your heart, you

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
begin to draw the
experience to you.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So if this is the realm where
all possibilities exist,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
if this is the
realm where there's

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
an infinite amount
of time and you

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:84%
can merge your consciousness
with a greater consciousness

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and create from the field
instead of from matter,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:84%
then you can become the
consciousness of anyone.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.410 align:middle line:90%
You can have anybody.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:90%
You can live anywhere.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You can own anything, and
you can be in any time.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And since all possibilities
exist in the eternal now,

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:90%
there is no past.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:90%
There is no future.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
There is the eternal
present moment.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
If moving from space-time
into time-space

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
we have to pass through a
bridge, or through a portal,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:02.370 align:middle line:84%
then the fourth
dimension is time.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:84%
As we begin to move into the
present moment and we move

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
into time-space, we move
into the fifth dimension--

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:90%
the multiverse--

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
where there's infinite
possibilities-- the unknown

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:90%
instead of the known.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
That's where all
potentials exist.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a good way for
you to understand space-time--

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:10%
the realm of the
three-dimensional world,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:10%
the Newtonian world--

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:10%
and the bridge to the quantum--

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:10%
fourth dimension--
moving to the realm

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:10%
of time-space, where there's
an infinite amount of time,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:10%
or the quantum world.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.075 align:middle line:10%
Once you get there, then
there's infinite possibilities,

00:20:38.075 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:10%
and it makes sense
you can become

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:10%
the consciousness of anybody,
of anyone, anything, anywhere,

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:10%
in any time.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So as you move from one
point of consciousness

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
to another point
of consciousness,

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:84%
you move through space
and you experience time.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are the source
of all consciousness,

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:90%
you are the all and all.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:84%
If you are creating
from that place,

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle line:90%
then you can't move anywhere.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
The only way you
move through time

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
is by changing your
vibration, or your frequency.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And as you move through time
and change your frequency,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you experience
dimensions, or spaces.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's give you an example.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:84%
You're in the realm where
you're beyond space and time.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no place to go,
because there's no space,

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
and if there's no
space, there's no time.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:90%
There's just one, long moment.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And you want to begin to
experience other possibilities.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, the only way you are
going to move through them--

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
instead of moving from
one point to another,

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:90%
speeding up or slowing down--

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:90%
you just change your frequency.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And as you change
your frequency,

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:10%
or you change your thought, and
every thought has a frequency,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:10%
and you can tune into the
frequency of that thought,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:10%
or that possibility, you
begin to move through time,

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:10%
and you experience
spaces, or dimensions.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.050 align:middle line:10%
I was interested
in what connects

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:10%
the physics of this field
to the biology of our brain.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And I spent quite a bit of time
researching the pineal gland

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and all its magical elixirs,
and how all those chemicals fit

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
into the same receptor sites
as serotonin and melatonin

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, but they produce
a lucid, or transcendental

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I started to realize that
this was the latent system that

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
allowed frequency and
information to be transduced

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:90%
into imagery in our brain.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it is that
latent system that

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
begins to create
the inner world,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:90%
that transcendental moment.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
sitting on my couch,

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and I just closed my eyes
and I was watching the fire,

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and my brain was
kind of in trance.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And as I closed my
eyes, I said to myself,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:90%
where are you, anyway?

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
about the pineal gland.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was searching
with my awareness

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:90%
on where it was in my brain.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
I see this little gland

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
in my brain releasing
all this milky substance.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
I see this beautiful pocket

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
watch, but it was glistening.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It was bright and lucid.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the
hands, very quickly,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.590 align:middle line:90%
move backwards in time.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:90%
So now I'm moving through time.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And as the hands
move backwards, I'm

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
standing over myself
as an awareness--

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
not with my body,
but I'm over my body

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:90%
as a nine-year-old child.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was laying on my
back, and I had the covers

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:90%
right up to my nose.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And my mother just left the
room because I had a fever.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I was a
child, I loved fevers.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I loved fevers
because it would

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
create these very lucid
and transcendental moments

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:90%
and experiences.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And so my parents asked
if I wanted any medication

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:90%
for the fever.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.440 align:middle line:84%
From the time I
was little, I never

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:84%
wanted the fever to go
away, because I was always

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:90%
super lucid.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
I was in the fever,
and I was surrendering.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you
know, my awareness--

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Joe Dispenza from
the current now--

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
is observing Joe
Dispenza from the past,

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.410 align:middle line:90%
a nine-year-old child.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching the
nine-year-old child sort

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
out time as this checkerboard
of possibilities,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.130 align:middle line:90%
but it's three-dimensional.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this
young boy, mystified

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
that a nine-year-old child would
be thinking about these things,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and I fell in love with him.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I just fell in love with him.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was me--

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
the current me-- falling
in love with that guy

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.930 align:middle line:90%
that was drawing me to me.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I felt
this tremendous amount of love,

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that what my destiny
was-- to get to the place

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I currently was.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, the
time piece appears again,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
and the hands of the clock
begin to move forward.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.153 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm moving
through time again,

00:24:43.153 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to experience
another dimension,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.170 align:middle line:90%
another space.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:90%
But now I'm the future me.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking in my backyard
as an exalted version

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.280 align:middle line:90%
of Joe Dispenza.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I am connected to everything.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
There's no separation between
me and the material world.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
My heart is wide open, feeling
so empowered and so awake

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and so aware.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I
saw this beautiful woman

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
that was no bigger than
this in a white gown--

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
radiant.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was another woman
that was kind of protecting her.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I looked
at her, she looked at me,

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and I felt this
incredible amount of love.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
She was sending a
frequency into my body,

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and I realized in that moment
that there was more love

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.000 align:middle line:84%
to experience than I was
already experiencing,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was feeling pretty
good at that time.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
why I was there.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm the upgraded
version of my future self.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I've traveled through time.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I look at the window,

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's my present
self, moments before I got

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.880 align:middle line:90%
on the couch, washing dishes.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And as I was standing there
as my upgraded version,

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I fell in love with that guy,
and I felt such love for him.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And while I was washing those
dishes, all of a sudden,

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.670 align:middle line:84%
in that moment, I
felt this kind of love

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.365 align:middle line:90%
in my heart out of nowhere.

00:26:01.365 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's an example of where
my future self was falling

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:84%
in love with my
present self, and it

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:84%
was my future self that was
drawing my present self to it.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a future
you that already

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.870 align:middle line:84%
exists that's more enlightened,
more knowledgeable, more

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:84%
wise, more loving, more caring,
more magical, more mystical

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:90%
that already exists.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you're going
to get there is to become it.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to
overcome certain aspects

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of our limited self
over and over again,

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:84%
we actually become
that future self.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've shown you the
difference between space-time

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and time-space, are
there latent systems

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:84%
in your brain that
can be activated which

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
will connect the physics
of the quantum field

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to the biology of
your body and brain?

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:84%
In a way, do we have a
built-in radio receiver

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that can decode
frequency that's carrying

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
vital information into
meaningful imagery

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:90%
in your brain?

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we're going
to discuss the sacred science

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.470 align:middle line:90%
of the pineal gland.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe
Dispenza, for "Rewired,"

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:10%
and I hope to see you in
the next episode, where

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:10%
we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:90%
