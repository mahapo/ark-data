In essence, you become your own genetic code engineer through the replication of these experiences. Dispenza claims that this can affect not only cancer tumors and heart disease but also can increase longevity by lengthening telomeres, as well.

It is a way we can tune into our own energy by creating coherence in each of the chakras to improve well-being. He explains that these points in the body are much more than chakras. There are certain glands of the endocrine system located at each of these points, and each one has its own brain. Just as we learned to create coherence in the brain and heart, we can create coherence in each of these energy centers. Doing this gives you a means of tuning into your energy centers, creating coherence, and sending chakra healing throughout the whole body. Through guided meditation, you'll be able to activate your autonomic nervous system, slow down your brainwaves, and rewire yourself. Wake up to a new you.\n\nHe is the New York Times bestselling author of Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, Becoming Supernatural, You Are the Placebo, and many more.
