00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So many of us have
heard the term, be present,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.750 align:middle line:84%
or, stay in the now, but
what does that really mean?

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Many individuals
talk about meditation

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
as a tool to become present.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But from a scientific
point of view,

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to offer you a
new way to understand

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
what it means to
be fully present,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and how you can
use your meditation

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
practice to transcend your
body, your environment in time

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
in order to reach the sweet
spot of the generous, present

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the previous episode,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:10%
we went into depth on how change
works in the brain and body.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But how do we get really
focused on this change?

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going to
demystify meditation and show

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
you how to get into
the present moment

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
so you can focus on creating
a new personality, and thus,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
a new personal reality.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
This will help you
understand a fundamental part

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
of becoming supernatural,
which is to get

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:90%
past the analytical mind.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
the first question.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
What does the word
meditation mean?

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, the word meditation, if you
research the symbol in Tibetan,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:10%
the word literally means
"to become familiar with."

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, familiarization
means, then,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
if 95% of who you are by
the time you're 35 years old

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:84%
is a set of hard-wired thoughts,
unconscious, automatic habits

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and behaviors, and reflexive
emotional reactions that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.160 align:middle line:84%
define our
personality, that means

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
95% of who we are typically
runs in an unconscious or

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:90%
subconscious program.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Then the first
start to change is

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:84%
becoming conscious of
your unconscious thoughts,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
beginning to become aware
of your automatic actions

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and behaviors.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
to notice how you're

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
feeling, as you're beginning
to observe and become

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.740 align:middle line:84%
familiar with those
states of mind and body,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
you are now no longer the
program, living unconsciously.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.740 align:middle line:10%
Now you're becoming conscious
of your unconscious self.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.400 align:middle line:10%
So think about this, many
people quit in their meditation

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:10%
practice because
they don't think

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:10%
they can control their mind.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're thinking 60,000
to 70,000 thoughts in one day,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:84%
the majority of those
thoughts are the same thoughts

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.780 align:middle line:90%
as the day before.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're hard-wired,
automatic attitudes

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
and thoughts.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
They're typically
happening behind the scenes

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
of your awareness.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts like,
I'll never change.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.000 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.920 align:middle line:90%
My life isn't very good.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll never find love in my life.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
I'll never find the right job.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
These are the
thoughts that people

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
think constantly, every day.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So then when those
thoughts start

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
coming to the surface in
their meditation practice,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the moment they
start realizing they

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
can't control those
thoughts, they give up.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And they buy into the
belief that they're not

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:90%
very good at meditation.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But let's start by framing
this a little differently.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:10%
The moment you become conscious
of those unconscious thoughts

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.480 align:middle line:10%
and you decide not to put
your attention and your energy

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:10%
behind them, that's a victory.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the moment you
start noticing those thoughts,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and instead of reacting to
them, just observing them,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
you are beginning
to know thyself.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, then,
in your meditation

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:84%
practice that your
body is in a program

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and it's busy every single
day doing a lot of things,

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and it wants to get up
and go do something,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:84%
it wants to begin to
habituate and autopilot,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and you become aware that
your body wants to do that,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and instead of responding
to the body as the mind

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and getting up and quitting,
if you can settle it

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
back down into the
present moment,

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:90%
that's a victory as well.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you're saying then
that your body is no longer

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:90%
the mind, you're the mind.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.667 align:middle line:90%
And those victories add up.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.152 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Every time you
work on overcoming

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.740 align:middle line:84%
some aspect of your
old personality,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:90%
there's a liberation of energy.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've measured this on
students all around the world.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Because as they keep
returning the body back

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
into the present
moment, the body

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:90%
is the servant to the mind.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And just like
training any animal,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later, it's
going to acquiesce.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And when it does, there
is a liberation of energy.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's available energy
for you to use to heal.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
That's available
energy for you to begin

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:90%
to create a new future.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So then we said in
the last episode

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that the process of
change is breaking

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
the habit of the old self
and reinventing new self.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It's pruning
synaptic connections

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and sprouting new connections.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense, then, if
you are going to transition

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
from the old self
to the new self,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and you decide, what thoughts
do I want to fire and wire

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in my brain, and you begin
to put all of your energy

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in installing those thoughts
neurologically in your brain,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
the act of firing and wiring
over and over again begins

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to assemble new
neurological networks.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, neural networks
are gangs of neurons

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that have been fired
and wired together

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
that relate to a thought,
a memory, a behavior.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
The body begins to
assemble new circuits

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
so it becomes more automatic.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense, then, if
you keep firing and wiring

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts, and
they begin to assemble

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
into automatic
neurological networks,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and you do it over
and over again,

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts
are going to begin

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
to become familiar to you.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Then the thought in
your mind literally

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
becomes the experience, and
experience enriches the brain.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.522 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.522 --> 00:07:20.498 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:20.498 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at another
way to understand meditation.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:10%
If we know that we are living
in a state of the familiar past,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:10%
or we're living in the state
of the predictable future,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:10%
and the familiar past
represents the known,

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:10%
and the predictable future
represents the known as well,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and the sweet spot of the
generous present moment

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:10%
represents the unknown, then
in order for us to truly begin

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:10%
to make significant changes,
where our body isn't

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:10%
influencing our mind, where our
environment isn't controlling

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:10%
our feelings and our thoughts,
then it makes sense, then,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.060 align:middle line:10%
that the first step that we
have to use in order to meditate

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:10%
is to sit our bodies
down and close our eyes

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:10%
and disconnect from everything
known in our outer environment.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Less sensory information
is coming into the brain.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:10%
Now, all of a sudden,
your inner world

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:10%
starts becoming more real
than your outer world.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
If you can sit your body down,
and like training that animal,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:90%
saying to your body, you stay.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to feed you.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.040 align:middle line:90%
You can check your emails.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:90%
You can check your text.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
You can post
anything on Facebook.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get a shower.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
a cup of coffee.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But right now, you're
no longer the mind.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm the mind.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Your body's in a
program, and where

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
you place your attention is
where you place your energy.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you're
sitting in your meditation

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and you start putting
your attention

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
on the emotions, familiar
emotions that are connected

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.270 align:middle line:84%
to the past, the
moment you start

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:84%
thinking about those memories
and feeling those emotions,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense, then, that
you're siphoning your attention

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and energy out of the
present moment into the past.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you're sitting
there thinking

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
about the phone calls
you have to make,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the meetings you have to go
to, the shopping list you have

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to get to, those
are all known things

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
in your predictable
future reality.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And every time you
put your attention

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
on some predictable
future, you're

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
siphoning energy out
of the present moment

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
into the predictable future.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And now your energy
is completely

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:84%
commingled with
that line of time.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So then when you become
aware that your attention is

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
on those emotions,
and you become aware

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and we turn your attention
back to the present moment,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
you're disinvesting your
attention and energy out

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
of your past, present reality
and you're calling it back

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.004 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:10:16.004 --> 00:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Every time you do
that, it's a victory,

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and those victories add up.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.588 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:28.025 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the stronger
the emotion that you

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
feel for some problem or
condition in your life,

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
the more you pay
attention to the cause.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, where you
place your attention

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
is where you place your energy.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're sitting
in your meditation

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling a very
strong emotion that's

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
connected to some
problem or some person,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:84%
we could say then that
you're giving your very life

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
force away to that
person or that problem.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's available
energy that you could be

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:90%
using to create a new future.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:10%
So then as you sit in
your meditation practice,

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:10%
and your body is used to at
8 o'clock in the morning,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:10%
checking emails and getting
frustrated and judgemental,

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:10%
your body is going to notice
that you're off schedule,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:10%
and it's looking
for those chemicals.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're aware that
your body is doing that,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and you settle your body back
down into the present moment

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and you lower the
volume to that emotion,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take your
attention off that person

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:90%
or that condition in your life.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it takes a greater
level of awareness, a greater

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
level of energy to begin to
break those energetic bonds

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
with everything in your
past, present reality

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
that you're connected
to emotionally.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So then when a
person finally starts

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
to overcome those
emotions, all of a sudden,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
they start calling
energy back to them,

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and they begin to build their
own electromagnetic field.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.805 align:middle line:84%
And now they have available
energy to design a new destiny.

00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:18.483 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.483 --> 00:12:21.934 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:21.934 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So think about meditation as a
form to get beyond your body,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.260 align:middle line:90%
to get beyond your environment.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
environment made of?

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
People, objects, places,
everything material

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
in your three-dimensional
reality.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:84%
If you keep your attention
on everything that's known,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create
more of the known.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:10%
So then as you disconnect
from your body,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:10%
and you get beyond
all the elements known

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:10%
in your outer
environment, and you

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:10%
keep working for the sweet spot
of the generous present moment,

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:10%
what you're saying
is, I want to begin

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:10%
to change the way
I think, and I want

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:10%
to be able to create
something new.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So meditation, then,
allows us to move

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
from living unconsciously
as a victim, in other words,

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:84%
allowing our outer world
to control our thoughts

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and feelings, to
consciously becoming

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:84%
the creator of your life
so that your thoughts

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and feelings begin
to produce outcomes

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in your outer environment.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And so then if you
do this properly,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:84%
we should see changes in your
body, in your environment,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.379 align:middle line:90%
and in some future time.

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:46.313 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:46.313 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, the purpose
of meditation is

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond your
analytical mind.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what separates
your conscious mind

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
from your subconscious mind
is your analytical mind.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
When you're born, you're
totally subconscious mind.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And we know this to be the case,
because children's brainwaves

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:84%
for the first six years of their
life are in a very slow state,

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and it makes them very
suggestible to information.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they have no
analytical facilities.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
that they're exposed to

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
goes into their
subconscious mind unedited.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:90%
For example, big boys don't cry.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Little girls should
be seen and not heard.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Money is the root of all evil.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And when children listen
to this information

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
without analyzing
it, it begins to lay

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of who they will
become later on in their life

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So if 95% of who we are by
the time we're 35 years old

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
is our subconscious
mind, then it's

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
entirely possible
that children become

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:84%
programmed at a very early
age into some subconscious

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
behaviors that they're not
even aware of because of things

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
they've seen or been exposed
to with their parents

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:90%
or primary caregivers.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So then this circle
represents your mind.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you learn by these
different positive and negative

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
identifications and
associations that

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
give rise to your habits
and your behaviors.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
A good example of a positive
identification or association

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.170 align:middle line:84%
is when you're young and
you're hungry or uncomfortable

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and you cry out.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you get
fed or the discomfort

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
has been removed, you learn
to associate subconsciously

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:90%
crying out with being fed.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So every time you're
uncomfortable or you're hungry

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and you cry out, that
behavior produces

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
a response called getting fed.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And so a good example of
a negative association

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
is when you're young and you're
exploring your environment,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you
walk over to the stove

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and you stick your
finger in the flame.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The moment you notice a
change in your internal state,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
you pay attention
to the cause of it.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you begin
to associate that pain

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
with that white
object in the kitchen.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
start developing a behavior

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:10%
And these positive and
negative identifications

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:10%
and associations begin
to lay the foundation

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:10%
of our subconscious
habits and behaviors.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, because brain
waves are changing

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:10%
and the child is interacting
more in the environment,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:10%
and as the child,
by trial and error,

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:10%
is noticing different feelings
or different experiences that

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:10%
produce different
emotions, when they

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:10%
start feeling new
emotions, they begin

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:12.280 align:middle line:10%
to pay attention to the
cause, their brainwaves

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:10%
start to speed up and
they move into what's

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:10%
called alpha brainwave
patterns, and they

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:10%
begin to develop
their analytical mind.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the analytical
mind is exactly what

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
separates the conscious mind
from the subconscious mind.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:10%
And as children's
brainwaves change

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:10%
because they're interacting
with their environment,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:10%
somewhere between
the ages of 6 and 9,

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:10%
they begin to completely
form their analytical mind.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:10%
Once that analytical
mind is formed,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:10%
they begin to divide
the conscious mind

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:10%
from the subconscious mind.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:10%
Now, as we've been
saying all along,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.553 align:middle line:10%
your conscious mind is
5% of your total mind.

00:17:52.553 --> 00:17:54.220 align:middle line:10%
Your conscious mind
is made up of things

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:10%
like logic and reasoning,
which gives rise

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:10%
to your faith, your will,
and your creativity.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, your subconscious mind,
as we've been saying all along,

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:10%
is made up of 95% of who
you are by the time you're

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:10%
35 years old, and those are
all those hardwired attitudes,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:10%
unconscious beliefs and
perceptions, subconscious

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:10%
habits and behaviors,
and that makes up

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:10%
the majority of who you are.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.899 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, the analytical mind
is always busy working.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The analytic mind
is important for us,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
because we need our analytical
mind to survive in our life.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And because the brain
is divided in half,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the analytical mind is
always weighing past

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
against future, right against
wrong, known against unknown.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And because the
division of the brain

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
allows us to navigate with our
analytical mind in our lives,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:90%
we need it.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
We need our analytical mind
when we're learning new things.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:84%
We need our analytical
mind when we're navigating

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.692 align:middle line:90%
in our life ethically.

00:19:01.692 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
We need our analytical
mind when we

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
need to make decisions
and choices that

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:90%
are really important.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But when you throw in
the hormones of stress,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and the brain becomes aroused
because of the emergency state

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
the brain is in, we
become overly analytical.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:84%
When people are
analyzing their lives

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
within some disturbing
emotion that

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
are derived from the
hormones of stress,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and those emotions are familiar
emotions from the past,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:84%
by thinking in the
box of the past,

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.380 align:middle line:84%
they drive their brain further
into a more aroused state,

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're moving
further away from moving

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
into those subconscious
states where

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
they can begin to make change.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.255 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So the whole purpose
of meditation,

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
then, is to get beyond
the analytical mind

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and enter the operating system
where those subconscious

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
programs exist.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So then we can begin to
take limited beliefs,

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
unconscious habits
and behaviors,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and begin to reprogram them,
become more self-serving

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
or more effective.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't change
the subconscious mind

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:90%
with your conscious mind.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to get beyond
the analytical mind

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:90%
in order to do that.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So some people have
a very thin veil

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
between their conscious mind
and their subconscious mind.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And the thinner the veil
between your conscious mind

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and subconscious
mind, the more you

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
are suggestible to information.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
just like the child,

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
that information can enter
the subconscious mind

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and begin to have
an effect on us.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So we want to be
more suggestible

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:10%
during the meditative
process because we

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:10%
want to accept, believe, and
surrender to certain thoughts

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.890 align:middle line:10%
without analyzing it so
we can begin to program

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:10%
our subconscious mind.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So then others have a very
thick veil or thick barrier

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
between their conscious mind
and their subconscious mind

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're less
suggestible to information.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And suggestibility
is your ability

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to accept, believe, and
surrender to information

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:26.470 align:middle line:84%
without analyzing it,
so the information

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
doesn't pass through the
analytical mind as easily.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So then the more analytical
you are, the less suggestible

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:90%
you are to information.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.680 align:middle line:84%
The less analytical you
are, the more suggestible

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.890 align:middle line:90%
you are to information.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:84%
When you learn how to
control your brainwaves

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and move into a
state of trance, you

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
pause in your brain, and
your brain kind of moves

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.200 align:middle line:90%
into stasis.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And in that state where you're
not thinking and analyzing

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a state
of trance, you're

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.450 align:middle line:84%
more suggestible to information,
and you move your brainwaves

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:84%
from the thinking, conscious
mind into a slower brainwave

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:84%
pattern in the
subconscious mind.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It also makes sense that as
you increase your brainwaves,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.400 align:middle line:84%
you're all of a
sudden increasing

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:84%
your analytical
facilities, because you're

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
thinking and analyzing more,
and your brain is less trance,

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're less
suggestible to information.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So in the meditative
process, as we

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:84%
begin to reprogram
those subconscious

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
states of mind and body, what we
want to do is learn the skill,

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
learn the formula, apply
the tools to practice

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
getting beyond the
analytical mind

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
so that you can begin to make
those subconscious changes that

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.210 align:middle line:90%
become more permanent.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you're living in
a subconscious program,

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:84%
just like a program
on your computer,

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:84%
the moment you press play or
start, it runs automatically.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.270 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
happens subconsciously.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
subconscious programs

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:90%
that are defining their lives.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Even though their conscious
mind wants something else,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
their subconscious mind may
be sabotaging their outcome.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So then we have to begin to
reprogram that subconscious

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
mind and begin to
write a new program.

So now that I've
laid out the basics

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of the model of
meditation and how

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
you can transcend your
analytical mind, your body,

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
your environment, as
well as the familiar past

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and the predictable
future in time,

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.180 align:middle line:84%
in order to create a
new life, shouldn't we

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:90%
be meditating on a daily basis?

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And we live in two
states of mind.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We either live in a
state of survival,

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
or we live in a
state of creation.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:10%
And living in survival
is living in stress.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of
people in this world

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
spend the majority of
their time living in stress

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:90%
and living in survival.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:84%
In that state, it's
impossible to create.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will delve

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
into survival versus creation,
and how you can further

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
understand stress and what it
can do to you and your life.
