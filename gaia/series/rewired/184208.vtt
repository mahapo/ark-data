00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that your
brain has been conditioned

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and habituated by you to view
your outer reality in a very

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:90%
limited way?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:84%
When you focus your
attention on a daily basis

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:84%
in this three-dimensional
reality,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
your brain naturally narrows its
focus on everything material.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:84%
As you learned in
the last episode,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
this is called a
conversion focus.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.562 align:middle line:84%
And it's the hormones of stress
that amplify this process.

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
there are other ways

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:84%
to focus your attention
to break the habit of how

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:90%
you see the world?

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And can you make your brain
begin to work differently?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the previous episode,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:10%
we went into great
detail on the difference

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:10%
between survival and creation.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going to
identify in a very simple way

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
the different types of
brainwaves to show you

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:84%
the skill of being able
to consciously control

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:90%
your own brainwaves.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.206 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by understanding the
different types of brainwaves.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.970 align:middle line:10%
When neurons fire
in your brain, they

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:10%
emit electromagnetic
frequencies.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:10%
And science has been able
to capture those frequencies

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:10%
by using a technology called
electroencephalographic

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:10%
readings, or EEG readings.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
We put on a cap on
a person's head,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and there's these
little electrodes.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And we use a gel that
begins to couple the surface

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of that electrode to the scalp.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:10%
And we hook up those
electrodes to a computer

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:10%
that begins to measure
the different frequencies

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:10%
in different compartments in
different regions in the brain.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.560 align:middle line:10%
So then, let's talk about
the different brainwaves.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:10%
The first type of brainwave
is called beta brainwaves.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:10%
Think about your
brain as an organ

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:10%
that begins to create
meaning and coherence

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:10%
and order between what's
going on in your outer world

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:10%
and what's going on
in your inner world.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're
conscious and you're awake

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and your attention is on
your outer environment

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're aware of your
body in space and time,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
your brain has to
gather and begin

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to integrate all the different
information through those five

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:90%
different sensory pathways.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything you're
listening to and hearing,

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.980 align:middle line:84%
everything you're seeing,
everything you're feeling,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
everything you're smelling--
all of that information

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:84%
has to be integrated
by the brain.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And when the brain is active
and conscious and you're aware,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:84%
your brainwaves go into what's
called beta brainwave patterns.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about beta brainwave
patterns as your attention

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
primarily on your
outer environment.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So then, we've talked
about the principle

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of meditation and beginning
to regulate and change

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:90%
your brainwaves.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible,
then, that you

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
can begin to change your
brainwaves from beta brainwaves

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:90%
to alpha brainwaves?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, back in the
'60s and the '70s

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
when there was a lot of
research done on biofeedback,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:84%
there were researchers at
Princeton University that

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
spent an enormous
amount of time trying

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.040 align:middle line:90%
to change their brainwaves.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And over and over
again they were

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
unable to change their
brainwave patterns no matter

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:90%
what they did.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Whether they chanted, whether
they had positive affirmations,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
whether they burnt
incense, they did

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
all of these different types
of things, relaxing their body,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
nothing actually changed
their brainwaves,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
until one researcher was
so tired that he finally

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:90%
said, I give up.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And the moment he surrendered
and he let go and he gave up,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
he watched his brain
right before his eyes move

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
from beta brainwave patterns
to alpha brainwave patterns.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Think of alpha when your inner
world starts becoming more real

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
than your outer world.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Now most people, when they're
functioning in beta brainwave

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
patterns, they naturally shift
to alpha brainwave patterns.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The brain pauses for
a moment, and you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.310 align:middle line:84%
begin to think about what
you're thinking about.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when I do
lectures around the world

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'm watching people pay
attention, they're relaxed,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.783 align:middle line:84%
their attention is on
their outer environment,

00:04:47.783 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:84%
they're exposed
to the information

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'm teaching them, then
all of a sudden they stop

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and they pause and
then go like this.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they stop and
they pause, all of a sudden

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:84%
they're making their inner world
more real than the outer world,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and they freeze that
image in the brain,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and the brain begins to
consolidate it neurologically.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you get into
the meditative process

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and you sit your body
down and it's not eating,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
it's not smelling, it's not
tasting, it's not feeling,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
it's not experiencing, you're
not seeing, you're not hearing,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of course now you're
starting to disconnect

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:90%
from your outer environment.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And now your inner world
starts becoming more real

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:90%
than your outer world.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, brainwaves
in your thinking brain

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
begin to slow down.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And when that occurs, you move
into alpha brainwave patterns.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And alpha brainwave patterns
are slower brainwave patterns.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's the
significance of this?

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.980 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to move
into alpha from beta,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
you're beginning to move
beyond your analytical mind.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And now you're entering
the operating system

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
where all those subconscious
programs, habits, and behaviors

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So then in alpha, we
tend to no longer hear

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the voice in our head
that's talking to us,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden we start
to see in pictures and images.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Think of alpha as
the imaginary state.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Another way to think of alpha
is when you're driving down

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
the freeway in your car.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is fixed
in a state of trance.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:90%
You're in that state of alpha.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how
long you've been driving,

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.840 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea who's
been driving the car,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you have no attention on
anything in your outer world.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
You're imaging
pictures in your mind,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and you have to move in the
alpha in order to do that.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:10%
There's another brainwave state
called theta brainwave state.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:10%
This is a hypnotic state.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:10%
This is a state of
heightened suggestibility.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Suggestibility is your
ability to accept, believe,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to information
without any analysis.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So in theta, it's a very
slow brainwave state.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, the body
is resting and semi-asleep,

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and you're awake.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Or better said, you are
conscious in your subconscious

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
When a person moves into
theta, lights are out.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:10%
And the part of the
brain that connects you

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:10%
to everything known or
familiar in your life--

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:10%
the seat of the identity,
the conscious mind,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:10%
the personality-- now
has been suppressed.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And now consciousness
or awareness

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:10%
is moving out of the
neocortex, and it's

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.080 align:middle line:10%
beginning to move
into the subconscious

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:10%
centers of the brain.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, the next state is called
delta brainwave states.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:10%
And in delta, think about
delta as restorative sleep.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:10%
This is when your body
is in a catatonic state,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:10%
and it's completely asleep.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And now there's
very little activity

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:90%
in your conscious mind.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The last state is called
gamma brainwave patterns.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, you would
think that gamma is

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
a faster frequency than beta.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And in a sense, it is.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But now, when you live by
the hormones of stress,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:84%
the arousal of those
stress hormones

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
drives the brain not into
just a normal beta state

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
but a high beta state.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at gamma,
there is an arousal that's

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:90%
taking place in the brain.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But the arousal is not coming
from some danger, some threat,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
or some condition in your
outer environment that's

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
evoking the stress hormones
and causing emotions

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
like aggression or fear
or sadness to occur.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
In gamma, there is an
arousal within the body.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Energy from the body begins
to move up into the brain.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the brain moves

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
into a super-conscious
or super-aware state.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So think about gamma as a
super-aroused, super-conscious,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
super-aware state, where
your inner world tends

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:84%
to become more real
than your outer world.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just
see the difference

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
between high beta brainwave
patterns and gamma brainwave

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:10%
You can see that
the waves of gamma

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:10%
tend to be more compressed,
and the frequency

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:10%
tends to be a little bit faster.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at the left-hand
side of this graph.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You see the numbers going
from 0 all the way up to 100.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So delta brainwaves tend
to be at a frequency that's

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.830 align:middle line:90%
very slow in the neocortex--

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:90%
0.5 to 4 cycles per second.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Theta brainwaves tend to
be a little bit faster.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
They're 4 to 8
cycles per second,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and as we keep
increasing frequencies,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
you can see that alpha
brainwave patterns are about 8

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:90%
to 13 cycles per second.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, in low-level
beta, you can see

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
low level beta is about 13
to 15 cycles per second.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Mid-range beta is about 16
to 22 cycles per second.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk about this
before we go any further.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Low-level beta is a
healthy brainwave state.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when
you're learning, you

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
should be in low-level beta.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
threat, there's no danger,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:90%
it's the perfect time to learn.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But if a professor
came out while you

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:84%
were learning and
said, there's going

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a quiz at the end
of this teaching session

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and you have to pass the
quiz in order for you

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.243 align:middle line:84%
to pass the course, all
of a sudden the light bulb

00:10:36.243 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
in your brain would get
a little bit brighter,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.743 align:middle line:84%
and it would put
more energy in there,

00:10:39.743 --> 00:10:41.992 align:middle line:84%
and you would get more
awake or more aroused.

00:10:41.992 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're getting
ready to do a lecture

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
or getting ready to do a
speech, this kind of stress,

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
called eustress or
good stress, gives you

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.423 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more energy
to be able to navigate

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
in your three-dimensional
reality,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and the brain begins to
perk up a little bit.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, take a look
at high-level beta.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:90%
It's 22 to 50 cycles per second.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:10%
And high-level beta is more
than two to three times

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:10%
higher than low-level beta.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And in high-level beta,
this is when your brain

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:90%
is stuck in emergency mode.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And think about high beta
like driving your sports car

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:90%
on the freeway in first gear.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's good for the short
term, but once a person

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
gets stuck in this
high beta state,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:84%
now they're living in severe
anxiety, severe depression.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
They're in a state where
their brain is always aroused,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and they need something
outside of them

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to begin to sedate the body
so they can begin to relax.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is a problem
because living in high beta

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
is the arousal of
the stress hormones.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And as we begin to shift
our attention from one

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
person to another person to
another thing to another place

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:84%
to another time, the
arousal of the brain because

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:84%
of those stress hormones moving
into a very high beta state

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
not only causes the
high beta to happen,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:84%
but it causes the brain to begin
to function very incoherently.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And people tend to narrow
their focus on the danger.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And now they're enslaved to
the laws of Newtonian physics,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:84%
where they have to
rush to try to get

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:90%
things to happen in their life.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of people, their
brains are stuck in high beta.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, take a look at
gamma brainwave patterns.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:10%
You can see low gamma cycles
are between 25 to 50 cycles

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:10%
per second, and high
gamma brainwave patterns,

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:10%
they can go from 50 to
100 cycles per second.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is an arousal that's
taking place in the brain,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:10%
and the arousal is
producing emotions

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:10%
like ecstasy, bliss, euphoria.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different
type of arousal.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:10%
So then, if the
purpose of meditation

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:10%
is to get beyond
your analytical mind

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:10%
and what separates
your conscious mind

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:10%
from your subconscious mind is
your analytical mind, in order

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:10%
for you to get beyond
your analytical mind

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.710 align:middle line:10%
and enter the subconscious mind
where those automatic programs

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:10%
exist, you're going to have
to learn a formula or a way

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:10%
to begin to slow
your brainwaves down

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:10%
from high-level beta
to mid-range beta

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:10%
to low-level beta.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you start slowing down
into alpha brainwave patterns,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
you've crossed past
the analytical mind.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And now, as you begin to slow
your brainwaves down even

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
further, you're in the
subconscious part of the brain.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Now you can begin to make some
significant measurable changes.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:90%
So then, let's review this.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We go from beta to
alpha to theta to delta.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:10%
And think about
beta and alpha being

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:10%
the seat of your conscious mind,
and alpha, theta, and delta

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:10%
representing your
subconscious mind.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:10%
And as you begin to slow down
brain activity because you're

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:10%
no longer analyzing and
thinking with your neocortex,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:10%
then consciousness or
your awareness or energy

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:10%
naturally flows right
out of the neocortex

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:10%
right into your
limbic brain, the seat

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:10%
of your autonomic
nervous system.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the part of
your brain, remember,

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that begins to
control and regulate

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
all those automatic
bodily functions.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it's the
part of the brain that's

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
giving you life, that has
an agenda, to keep you

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:84%
in balance, to keep
you in homeostasis,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's very automatic.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So now you're in the
very operating system

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.720 align:middle line:84%
where you can begin to program
your autonomic nervous system

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.830 align:middle line:84%
to change its hormones, to
begin to change the body's

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:90%
function in some way.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, you are
conscious in your subconscious

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Brain scans have
shown that students

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that know how to regulate and
slow down their brainwaves,

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
they move into that
low-level alpha and theta,

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
they start to merge

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:84%
with their autonomic
nervous system.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And we call this
getting beyond the self.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And when the conscious mind is
merging with the subconscious

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:84%
mind or you're
beginning to connect

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
to your autonomic
nervous system,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
its job is to create
order and balance.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:10%
And when you get
beyond yourself,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:10%
get beyond everything known in
your three-dimensional reality,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:10%
something magical happens.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
When the autonomic nervous
system begins to connect

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're not activating
those circuits,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
you're not thinking and
feeling in the same cycles,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden it begins to
organize or create coherence

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
in the neocortex, which has
been fractured and subdivided

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.420 align:middle line:84%
because of the
hormones of stress.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, think about coherence
as order, as cadence, as rhythm.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Things are working synchronized
in an organized way.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Think of incoherence
like a group of drummers

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
with no rhythm banging on
the drums at the same time.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And the brain as well
as the heart that

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
are influenced by the
hormones of stress,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:84%
as they begin to function
in a very disorganized way,

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
that incoherence is a very
weak signal for the body.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Think about it like this.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
If you went to a football
game and something happened

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
favorable to the home
team and everybody

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
was clapping at the same
time and applauding,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that would be
incoherence in the brain.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, normal coherence
in the brain

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
would be like every 10th
person in the stadium clapping

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
in rhythm, and that's normal or
average for most human beings.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But when the brain and
heart get highly organized,

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
highly integrated,
highly synchronized,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:84%
imagine everybody in
the stadium clapping

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:90%
at the same time in rhythm.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it create
order and coherence,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but it also increases
the amount of energy

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:90%
in the brain and heart.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:84%
And when there's more
energy in the brain,

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
there's more energy
in the heart,

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:84%
there's a greater level of
awareness about your body,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:90%
your environment, and time.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you the
difference between coherence

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:90%
and incoherence.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:84%
On the left image,
where it says coherence,

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the
top of their head.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, 19 different
compartments of the brain

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that are connected
through electrodes,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and if all of those
compartments are synchronized,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:84%
you'll see the valleys and
the peaks all lined up,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and we'll call that
order or coherence.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
If different parts of the brain
are lagging or behind or out

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.970 align:middle line:84%
of order, then you'll
see all of a sudden,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
some of those valleys lining
up with some of the peaks

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and different
compartments of the brain

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
are not communicating
well with each other,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:90%
and we call that incoherence.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:10%
When we see a lot of blue when
we're measuring coherence,

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:10%
that means it has a low level
of coherence in the brain.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:10%
If you don't see any blue and
you see pink, that's normal.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:10%
And normal means average, what
the average person experiences

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:10%
in terms of coherence.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.830 align:middle line:10%
The red represents a high
amount of order in the brain.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:10%
And red means there's a
super level of coherence.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is a
normal brain scan.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
call a strip chart.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're measuring the 19
different parts of the brain.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
That brainwave pattern is
low-level beta brainwave

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person's sitting
there, their eyes are open,

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
they're being their normal self.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
We ask them to close their eyes,
begin to open their awareness,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
begin to open their focus
from a convergent focus

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.225 align:middle line:84%
to a divergent focus
or a broad focus,

00:18:56.225 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and in a matter of seconds,
this is what we see.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, coherence
is orderliness.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And look how those waves
are organized and stacked

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:90%
equally on top of each other.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
The brain is highly
synchronized,

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
or phase synchronized in
alpha brainwave states.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Here's another one.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Another person goes from a
narrow focus to a broad focus,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the
entire brain is coherently

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.890 align:middle line:90%
in alpha brainwave state.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Here's another person
who has global coherence.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
They go from a narrow
focus to a broad focus,

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
from a convergent focus
to a divergent focus,

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can see all of
those different brainwaves

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
beautifully stacked
on top of each other.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And we can say that the
brain is highly integrated.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
If you look at that arrow on
the right side of the screen,

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you can see that all of
those peaks are lining up.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
That means the entire brain
is in an alpha coherent state.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.390 align:middle line:84%
In this slide,
you're seeing someone

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
in phase synchronized coherent
theta brainwave patterns.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
The entire brain is
synchronized into theta,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.770 align:middle line:84%
and they're in that
hypnotic state,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
they're in that
suggestible state

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
where the lights are out
in the thinking neocortex.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And when they slip into
that theta brainwave state,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:84%
we can say that they're
completely beyond themselves,

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and they've dissociated
from everything

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:84%
known in their
three-dimensional reality.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Our research, as well as
other researchers at Princeton

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:84%
University and around
the world, have

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
found that if you can
broaden your focus,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to
open your awareness,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the act of taking your attention
off of everything material

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and putting your attention
on nothing but space,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:84%
if reality is both a
particle and a wave,

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:90%
if it's matter and energy--

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's an invisible field
of energy called the quantum

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:84%
field that exists beyond
this space and time

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that you can't experience
with your senses

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
but can only experience
with your awareness--

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and that unified field,
that invisible field

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
of frequency, that it is
that very frequency that

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:14.760 align:middle line:84%
connects everything material and
organizes everything into form.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So then when you
broaden your focus

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and you take your
attention off of matter,

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
you're putting your attention on
that invisible field of energy,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:84%
whose signature is oneness,
whose signature is order,

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:84%
whose signature is greater and
greater levels of wholeness.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The person is feeling so
whole, so in love with life,

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that it's impossible
for them to want.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can you want
when you feel whole?

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.440 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you
have everything.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we've measured
this on people.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we can actually
predict when it's

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to a person.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We start seeing more and
more order taking place

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.560 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, and all
of a sudden we can say,

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
after a certain
point, this person

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a very
transcendental moment.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we see those two
hemispheres coming together,

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
when that person is connecting
and they feel whole,

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
energy moves right
into their heart.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And their heart starts
beating very orderly and very

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.690 align:middle line:90%
coherently.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
The heart begins to produce
an ambient magnetic field.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Now the field and the
energy is beginning

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to broaden from the body,
and that energy is frequency.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency
carries information.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And now the person feels
connected to something greater.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can walk around
and look at that person,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and you can see tears
of joy rolling down

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
their face because they feel
so whole, they feel so in love

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
with life that they feel
connected to something greater,

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that I call that the
natural state of being.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean, then,
to get beyond the self?

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
If we're getting beyond
the analytical mind

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and cooling off brain activity
that's associated to everything

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
familiar in our life, that
means, then, in order for you

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
to get beyond
yourself, you're going

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to have to take your attention
off of everything material

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and known in this
three-dimensional reality.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And our research
shows that when you

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
go from a somebody to a nobody,
from putting your attention

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
on some things to putting your
attention on nothing, putting

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
your attention from
somewhere to nowhere,

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
when you're putting your
attention from some time

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:84%
into no time, that
is the moment you're

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
disconnecting from this
three-dimensional reality.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we call that
"getting beyond the self."

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, at this
elegant moment, you

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
are in the sweet spot of
the generous present moment.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can say now you're
at that perfect place

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.150 align:middle line:84%
in the eternal now for
you to begin to create

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:90%
something new from the unknown.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have no attention
on the predictable future

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:84%
or the familiar past, if you
have no attention on anything

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:84%
material in your
outer environment,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
on no one or nothing
or nowhere, and you've

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
gotten beyond your body,
which has been conditioned

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to be the mind, the only thing
that you are in that moment

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.420 align:middle line:90%
is pure consciousness.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you're pure
consciousness dissociated

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.240 align:middle line:84%
from everything
material in your life,

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.010 align:middle line:84%
now you're at the perfect
place to create something new.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've shown you
that there's a formula

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and how you can create a
more coherent, integrated,

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:84%
synchronized
brainwave state, I'd

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.080 align:middle line:84%
like to show you that this
process can affect your ability

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.180 align:middle line:84%
to reprogram and change
your own genetic destiny.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we're going
to explore how you can become

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.460 align:middle line:90%
your own genetic engineer.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Joe Dispenza
for "Rewired,"

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see you in
the next episode, where

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:90%
