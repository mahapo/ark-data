00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever
had a lucid dream,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.200 align:middle line:84%
an out-of-body experience, or a
mystical moment that caused you

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to change your view about
the world we live in?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered
how that happened

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.663 align:middle line:90%
or even why it happened?

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And have you ever had
the desire to have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
another similar experience?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
It is that transcendental moment
where we abandon everything

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that we know and we
begin to experience

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:84%
the realm of the unknown, as
if the mystery of the self

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:90%
is being revealed to us.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the previous episode,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:10%
we compared the realms of
space-time and time-space.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The material world, the realm
of three-dimensional reality,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
the world of the senses,
where everything takes time

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:84%
to happen, to the
immaterial world,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
the realm of the fifth
dimension of reality and beyond.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The world beyond the senses,
made of energy and frequency.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
In the next two
episodes I would like

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
to demystify the
mystical by combining

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.480 align:middle line:84%
the science of that lucid
world that seems so real to us

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in the moment with
ancient wisdom

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to show you latent systems
in your brain and body

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
that once activated
will take you to realms

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:90%
beyond space and time.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It is in this place that
ancient civilizations,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
which thrived for thousands of
years, were the most interested

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.960 align:middle line:84%
It is my hope that everything
you learn in this episode

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:84%
will demystify the
mystical so that you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
can begin to explore a
transcendental world that

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.556 align:middle line:90%
exists beyond your senses.

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:48.007 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with introducing
you to the pineal gland and two

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
important neurotransmitters,
serotonin and melatonin.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Let's start with the
word pe-nial or pineal,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:10%
both pronunciations are correct.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Pineal or pe-nial
meaning pinecone shape.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland, it looks
just like a pinecone.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
There's no coincidence that
it's called pinecone shaped.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the pineal gland
is a tiny little gland

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
a little bigger than the
size of a grain of rice.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
It's right between the
back of your throat

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:90%
and the back of your head.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
know exactly where it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is because when we begin
to practice activating

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland,
you're going to have

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of
where it exists and put

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.120 align:middle line:90%
your attention on it.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And where you place
your attention

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:90%
is where you place your energy.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
pay attention to it,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
the more you become aware of
it, the more you stay present

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
with it, the more you
begin to put energy

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.676 align:middle line:90%
to begin to activate it.

00:03:03.676 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is very
sensitive to visible light,

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
light that's coming from
the sun or light that's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
coming from lights that
we have in our homes

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:84%
or in our offices, that
wavelength of light.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Once light is perceived
when our eyes are open,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of light is
picked up by the optic nerve.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And it sends a signal right to
a nucleus in the brain called

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:90%
the suprachiasmic nucleus.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.350 align:middle line:84%
That nucleus signals the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:90%
which signals the pineal gland.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland gets
busy making a neurotransmitter

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
called serotonin.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:10%
And serotonin is the
daytime neurotransmitter

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:10%
that once activated begins
to cause us to become aware

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:10%
that we're local
in space and time,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.900 align:middle line:10%
and we become conscious
that we're our bodies

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:10%
in an environment and in time.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.960 align:middle line:10%
And it produces a certain
brainwave frequency called

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:10%
beta brainwave frequencies.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:10%
It is beta brainwaves
that causes

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:10%
us to put most of our
attention on the outer world.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, the release of
serotonin then gets us up

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:10%
and gets us busy during the day.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:10%
This graphic represents
that small frequency

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:10%
of visible light that exists
in the entire electromagnetic

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:10%
spectrum.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:10%
And it's that tiny little
sliver of all of reality

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:10%
that our eyes and our senses
are the most sensitive to.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:10%
When there is an
inhibition of light

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:10%
or there's a lack of light, the
lack of the wavelength of light

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:10%
that usually hits the back
of the eye, the optic nerve,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:10%
begins to diminish the release
of serotonin in the brain.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the inhibition
of light signals

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
the same nucleus
in the brain called

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
the suprachiasmic nucleus,
which then dampens down

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:90%
the sympathetic nervous system.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And now the pineal
gland begins to make

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:90%
a chemical called melatonin.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And melatonin is the
nighttime neurotransmitter.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And as melatonin levels begin
to rise because of darkness

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in the evening, then
all of a sudden,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
we begin to slow
our brainwaves down

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
into alpha, and theta,
and ultimately delta.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And its melatonin then
that allows our body

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
to restore and regenerate.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So serotonin gets us
up in the morning,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and melatonin puts
us to bed at night.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.750 align:middle line:10%
And those are two
important neurotransmitters

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:10%
that function in a rhythm
called the circadian rhythm.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:10%
And when you live in a certain
environment in a certain place

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:10%
in the world, and as the sun
comes up and the sun goes down,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:10%
your brain chemistry
becomes entrained to light.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
There's an amino acid
called L-tryptophan

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
that is the raw material or
the building block of serotonin

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and melatonin.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
L-tryptophan is turned
into 5-hydroxytryptophan,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
which is called 5-HTP, which
then another chemical cycle

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
takes place, and all of a
sudden we have serotonin.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin goes through
another biological process,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
biochemical process,
and it's turned

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
into N-acetylserotonin, which
ultimately becomes melatonin.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:10%
So very simple chemical
pathways in the pineal gland

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:10%
that is the alchemist in
the back of the brain that

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:10%
facilitates this process
based on the wavelength

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:10%
or the frequency
of visible light.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin levels are at their
highest during a 24-hour cycle

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:90%
between 1 AM and 4 AM.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
for you to know

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
because when we do the
meditation to activate

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.640 align:middle line:84%
this ancient gland in
the back of the brain,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
it's always important to know
that it's a good idea to wake

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
up early enough when the raw
materials are at their height.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin levels tend to go down
as stress hormone levels go up.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very,
very adaptive function

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.040 align:middle line:84%
over thousands of years of
trial and error in environment.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So when there is a stressful
event, a dangerous event,

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
when there's a perception
of something threatening

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
in the environment, we turn
on that stress hormones,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:84%
the fight-or-flight nervous
system, the sympathetic nervous

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
system, and now we're
prepared for danger.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So as long as we're perceiving
a threat in the outer world,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense then
it's not a good idea

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to go to sleep because sleeping
means you would be more

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable and possibly prey.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So as melatonin levels go
down as stress hormones go up,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
our sleep patterns
are interrupted

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
because the very raw material
that causes us to sleep

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
is diminished.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, as stress levels go down
and we're out of survival,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
out of emergency mode, then
melatonin levels go up,

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and the body can restore,
regenerate, and repair.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, melatonin,
the research on it

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.880 align:middle line:84%
has been profoundly
interesting because there's

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
so many important
biological processes

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:90%
that melatonin is involved in.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin promotes DNA
repair and replication.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It stops cortisol oversecretion
in response to stress.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if
your melatonin levels

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:84%
begin to go up, your stress
hormone levels go down.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And a little administration or
a little addition of melatonin

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
sometimes is enough
to jump start us

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:90%
to move into restorative sleep.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
It also improved
carbohydrate metabolism.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an interesting
concept because in antiquity,

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
when we were stressed or
living in survival, many times

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
it meant famine or
the lack of food.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So when the survival
gene is switched on,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
now the body's going

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
to take carbohydrates
and store them

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
as fats so that we have a
reserve of energy in the body.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:84%
So people who are constantly
under stress always

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
are taking carbohydrates
and storing them as fats.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin tends to
break that cycle.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:90%
It lowers triglyceride levels.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It inhibited atherosclerosis
or hardening of the arteries.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:84%
It heightens both cellular and
metabolic immune responses.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It decreased certain
tumor developments

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:90%
in laboratory animals.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
In certain laboratory animals,
it increased lifespan by 25%.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It has a very important
neuroprotective role

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It increases REM sleep.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It is an important free radical
scavenger, an antioxidant.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, antioxidant means
anti-cancer, anti-aging,

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
anti-heart disease, anti-stroke,
anti-neurodegenerative,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatory,
anti-microbial.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to remember
these important points

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
about melatonin
because melatonin

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is essential for our bodies
to repair and regenerate.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:10%
This is the ancient symbol from
the Egyptian culture called

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.130 align:middle line:10%
the Eye of Horus.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Next to it, this is what's
called a sagittal section

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you took the
two halves of the brain,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:10%
and you divided them
right down the middle,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:10%
and you pulled them apart,
you would be looking

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.350 align:middle line:10%
at a side view of the brain.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
striking resemblance

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:84%
between the limbic
brain, the seat

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:84%
of the autonomic nervous
system, and the Eye of Horus.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for you to
understand that this represents

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:90%
some type of inner vision.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Pineal gland has been known
to be called the third eye

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
because once it's stimulated
and activated to the next level,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
it gives us profound
inner vision.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:10%
This is called Fibonacci's
constant or the golden mean.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:10%
If you were to follow
that golden mean right

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:10%
around the circumference
of the brain,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:10%
it would wind up at the exact
spot of where the pineal gland

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:10%
exists in the brain.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And many different
things in nature,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from the universe to seashells
to the inner shape of a flower

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
all represent this
golden mean pattern.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, pineal gland has
a simple vein, artery,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
and nerve moving in and a vein,
artery, and nerve moving out,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and it has a very rich
and dense blood supply.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at this
article that I discovered,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
"Characterisation and Potential
Role of Electromechanical

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:90%
Transduction--

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
New Crystals in
the Pineal Gland."

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the abstract
says the pineal gland

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
is a neuroendocrine
transducer secreting

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
melatonin, responsible for the
physiological circadian rhythm

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
A new form of biomineralization
has been studied

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:90%
in the human pineal gland.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
It consists of small
crystals that are

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.920 align:middle line:90%
less than 20 microns in length.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
These crystals
could be responsible

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
for an electromechanical
biological transduction

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:90%
mechanism in the pineal gland.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Due to their structure and
their Piezoelectric properties.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a mouthful
of words, but there's

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
only two words that I want
you to pay attention to--

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Piezoelectric properties
and transducer.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Just remember those.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the next page, it says
the pineal gland microcrystals

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
appear as a stack of
thin rhombohedrons

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
with their flat surfaces
normal to the long axis

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:90%
of the crystal.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
If you were to
visualize that, you

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
have these calcium carbonate
or calcite crystals

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that are rhombohedron
in shape that

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
are stacked on top of each
other in the pineal gland.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you apply
a mechanical stress,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to
compress those crystals,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:84%
the compression
of those crystals

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:84%
begins to produce an external
electromagnetic field

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
or begins to take one form
of energy, mechanical stress,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.595 align:middle line:84%
and turn it into another form
of energy, an electrical charge.

00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
These are those
rhombohedron crystals that

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:90%
were in the previous article.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have them in
your pineal gland.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many vertebrates
have the same crystals

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:90%
in their pineal gland.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Homing pigeons, as an example,
have these tiny crystals, just

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
like you, that
are very sensitive

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:90%
to electromagnetic energy.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And because the Earth has its
own electromagnetic field,

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:84%
the pigeons can actually tune
into the strongest signal,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and they can navigate from
one place to another place

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because they're sensitive
to electromagnetism.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's information
they're picking up

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that's transcendent
of their senses.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
Piezoelectric effects.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So Piezoelectric effect is the
ability of certain materials

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to generate an electrical
charge in response

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:90%
to an applied mechanical stress.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:84%
The word Piezoelectric
is derived

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.360 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek piezein, which
means to squeeze or press,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and piezo in Greek,
which means to push.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
unique characteristics

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of the Piezoelectric effect
is that it is reversible,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the
materials exhibiting

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the direct
Piezoelectric effect--

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
that's the generation
of electricity

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:90%
when stress is applied--

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
also exhibit a converse
Piezoelectric effect,

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the generation of stress when
an electrical field is applied.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:10%
Stay with me because when
Piezoelectric material is

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.210 align:middle line:10%
placed under mechanical
stress, a shifting

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:10%
of positive and
negative charges centers

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.150 align:middle line:10%
in the material,
which then results

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:10%
in an external electrical field.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.850 align:middle line:10%
When reversed, the
outer electrical field

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:10%
either stretches or compresses
the Piezoelectric material.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a lot
of words, but I

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
want you to hang in there
with me now because I'm going

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:90%
to demystify that process.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.690 align:middle line:84%
How is it then can we
compress those crystals

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:90%
inside our brain?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:84%
How can we apply
mechanical stress.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
If our brain is encased in this
ivory cavern called our skull,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
how are we going to get in there
and compress those crystals?

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Inside your skull,
your spinal column,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and the bone at the
base of your spine

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
called your sacrum is
the most delicate system

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
in your body called the
central nervous system.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, without the aid
of your nervous system,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't digest your food,
you couldn't void your bladder,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't blink your eyes.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't move without the
aid of your nervous system.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So think of your nervous
system as the electrical wires

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:90%
that run the machine.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Inside this closed
system is fluid

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:90%
called cerebrospinal fluid.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And cerebrospinal fluid
has some basic functions.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It acts to create buoyancy in
the central nervous system.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
It acts to have a
neuroprotective role for trauma

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:84%
in case there's movement
or deceleration.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the fluid that protects
the brain and the spinal cord

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.600 align:middle line:90%
against bony edges.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It acts to transport fluids and
other chemicals and nutrients

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
to different parts of the
brain in the nervous system.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it has
an important role

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to enhance conductivity
or electrical charges

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:90%
in the nervous system.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
When you inhale, the sutures
of your skull open up.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you exhale, the
sutures of your skull close.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, at
the base of your spine

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
where that sacrum bone
exists, when you inhale,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:90%
that sacrum bone flexes back.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you exhale, that
sacrum bone flexes forward.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
So visualize this with me.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The inhalation causes
the sutures to open up.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:84%
There's more volume
in the skull.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And the sacrum bone
flexing back causes

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that cerebral spinal fluid
to drain down in gravity.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
When you exhale, and the
sacrum bone flexes forward,

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and the system closes down,
and those sutures close,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
it begins to propagate a wave to
move the cerebral spinal fluid

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:90%
up against gravity.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to
charge one molecule

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of cerebrospinal fluid,
and tag it, and follow it

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:84%
during the course of the day,
that cerebral spinal fluid

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:84%
would move from the
base of your spine,

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:84%
all the way up through
four different chambers

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:59.260 align:middle line:84%
called aqueducts or
ventricles in the brain,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.960 align:middle line:84%
pass all the way through,
and come all the way down.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It would take 12 hours
for a healthy person

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to begin to move that
cerebrospinal fluid all the way

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:90%
through that system.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we flush
our brains twice a day.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if you were to
contract the intrinsic muscles

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
in your body, the muscles
you use for elimination,

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
the muscles you use
for intercourse, you

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
were to contract
your lower abdomen,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
pull your belly button
in towards your spine,

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and contract your upper abdomen?

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The act of contracting
these intrinsic muscles

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.700 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient yoga
tradition called the Bandhas.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
As you squeeze
these muscles, you

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:45.070 align:middle line:84%
begin to push that
cerebral spinal fluid up.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if you were to
take one slow, steady breath.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And as you slowly
follow your breath,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.413 align:middle line:84%
and you contract those
intrinsic muscles,

00:18:55.413 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:84%
as you follow your breath,
and you bring that breath

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
that pineal gland,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
and you hold your breath,
and you keep your attention

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:90%
on that pineal gland.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
That's your target.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:10%
The act of contracting
those muscles along

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.910 align:middle line:10%
with the holding of
your breath would

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:14.820 align:middle line:10%
begin to push cerebrospinal
fluid right up into your brain.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
hold your breath,

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.470 align:middle line:84%
you're pushing that
cerebrospinal fluid right up

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:84%
against the crystals
of the pineal gland

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and applying a
mechanical stress.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the mechanical stress
begins to electrically activate

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.660 align:middle line:90%
those crystals.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And when those crystals
become electrically activated,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
we are turning on the radio
receiver in the brain.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, take a look at the
ventricles in your brain.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:10%
You have a fourth ventricle that
sits close to the brain stem.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:10%
Take a look at the
third ventricle.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.320 align:middle line:10%
That place right there,
that corner right there

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.660 align:middle line:10%
is where the pineal gland
sits in the dead end.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And then you have two
lateral ventricles.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Now take a look at this.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the ventricles,
and it looks a lot

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
like that Eye of Horus
that we were talking about.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Here's the movement
of that fluid.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
You can see that it comes up
from the body to the brain.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:10%
It passes through all
of those aqueducts.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It travels along the surface
of the top of the neocortex,

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and it drains all
the way back down.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So then when you inhale, and
take a slow, steady breath,

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and coordinate that breath with
a contraction of muscles, what

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
you're doing now is
you're delivering energy

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
into the brain by
electrically activating it.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a magnet.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
A magnet has a north
pole and a south pole.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger the polarity
between the north pole

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and the south pole,
the stronger there

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
is an invisible
electromagnetic field

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
that exists around the magnet.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't see that field with
your senses, but it exists.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, if you
were to take a magnet

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:10%
and place it on top
of metal shavings,

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:10%
those metal shavings would
begin to organize themselves

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:10%
right in the patterns of
the electromagnetic field--

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.270 align:middle line:10%
energy having an
effect on matter.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Your body is also a magnet.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It has a north pole
and a south pole,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and Asian cultures
have known about this

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.213 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:21:22.213 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the research
that was done

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:84%
at Yale University in the
'40s and studying eggs

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.420 align:middle line:90%
of different vertebrates.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.340 align:middle line:84%
When they studied
those eggs, they

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
found that 100% of the time that
the positive charge was always

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
at the head, and the negative
charge was always at the tail,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.470 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there is an
invisible electromagnetic field

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
that is actually in
the shape of the egg.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, the body has
the same mechanisms.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.510 align:middle line:84%
We know that by the
time we're 35 years old,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
most of our energy is stored
in the body subconsciously

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and 5% is stored in
the brain and the mind.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're thinking
certain thoughts that

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.730 align:middle line:84%
are producing certain
chemicals that

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
make you feel a certain way,
and those thoughts are connected

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
to anger, or aggression,
or fear, or guilt,

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
or suffering shame, you're
taking thought and beginning

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
to store it as energy by feeling
the same emotion in these lower

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:90%
centers of the body.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So then, by the
same means, the more

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
we live by these first
three centers in our body,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
the more we are drawing
from this invisible field

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
of light and information and
turning it into chemistry.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We're causing the very field
around our body to shrink.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we're becoming more
matter and less energy,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.370 align:middle line:90%
more particle and less wave.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
These first three centers
are energy consumers,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
so we're drawing from the field
and turning it into chemistry.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We're squandering
our very life force.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
So now we're like
a piece of metal

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
that no longer has an
electromagnetic field

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of metal
that's no longer a magnet.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And now we have all
this energy stored

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:84%
in the body and a
very little bit amount

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:90%
of energy stored in the brain.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So then there's gotta be
a way to pull the mind out

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:84%
of the body, and to deliver that
energy right back in the brain,

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and take all the
energy that you use

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
for making a baby, all the
energy that you use to digest

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
a meal, all the energy that
you use to react to someone

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.870 align:middle line:84%
or something, and instead
of releasing it out,

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
we want to draw it
up into the brain.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So then the breath is the way
that we deliver energy back

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Cerebrospinal fluid is
made of proteins and salts

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:90%
and solution.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you take
proteins and salts,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:84%
and you drop them
in solution, they

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.545 align:middle line:84%
develop a charge,
either a positive charge

00:23:55.545 --> 00:23:56.420 align:middle line:90%
or a negative charge.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.490 align:middle line:90%
They gain or lose electrons.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, when you do this
breath, and you begin to inhale,

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and you squeeze those
muscles, the act

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of squeezing those muscles,
and breathing, and coordinating

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that act begins to move
that cerebrospinal fluid

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:90%
towards your brain.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take a charged
molecule and you accelerate it,

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
you are going to produce
an external field called

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:90%
an inductance field.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.500 align:middle line:84%
If you move several
charged molecules,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
you'll create a bigger
inductance field.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And once you begin to move
energy like that, just

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:84%
like a magnet, you
begin to produce

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:90%
what's called a torus field.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And many things in
nature, from the shape

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.940 align:middle line:84%
of an apple to a universe to an
egg resemble this torus field.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Most people have most
of their energy stored

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in their first three centers.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And just like drawing
fluid up a straw,

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:84%
we are pulling that energy
with one slow, steady breath

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:84%
through our nose in the
attempt to deliver that energy

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:90%
right up to the pineal gland.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And once that energy moves
from the body to the brain,

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to produce
more energy in the brain,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
we should begin to see the
same effect like a magnet.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's the intrinsic
breath, the contraction

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:84%
of those muscles along with
the slow, steady breath

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and having our
attention on the target

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that once that energy
begins to move,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:90%
something amazing happens.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a activation of the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And when the sympathetic
nervous system is activated,

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.370 align:middle line:84%
now it's taking all that
energy that's normally

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:84%
stored in those first
three centers, the energy

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that it takes to make
a baby, the energy

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to digest a meal, the energy
to run from a predator

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
or to react to
someone or something,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and now that energy is
traveling up to the brain.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And the sympathetic
nervous system switches on.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And once it's
switched on, there's

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:54.660 align:middle line:90%
an arousal that takes place.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And that energy moves
right up to the brain.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And once it reaches
the brain, it

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
begins to produce an external
electromagnetic field.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:10%
The energy at the base of
the spine is a lot slower.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
As it moves up, the
energy gets faster.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And once that energy moves
from the base of the spine

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to the
brain, just like a magnet,

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to begin to produce
an ambient electromagnetic

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland has tiny little
cilia, hair-like extensions all

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:84%
When you hold your
breath and you finally

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
let your breath out, and you
allow that cerebrospinal fluid

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate, the acceleration
of that cerebrospinal fluid

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:84%
begins to stimulate and
tickle those little cilia.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And as it begins to
become stimulated,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland
begins to release

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
very sacred
chemicals, which we'll

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:90%
talk about in the next episode.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So as you inhale and
draw that energy up,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.050 align:middle line:84%
once the sympathetic nervous
system switches on and merges

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
with the parasympathetic
nervous system,

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:84%
the person is going to release
an enormous amount of energy

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:90%
up into the brain.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a gate
at the brainstem

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:90%
called the thalamic gate.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And that gate
typically is closed.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And it participates with a
system called the Reticular

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Activating System, or the RAS.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, the RAS is responsible
for levels of awareness.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.690 align:middle line:84%
If your cat is in the kitchen
and knocks something over

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.990 align:middle line:84%
or you hear somebody outside
in the middle of the night,

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
it's the reticular
activating system

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that brings you to a
greater level of awareness.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But the majority of the
time, the stimulation

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
is coming from our
senses, what we're hearing

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:90%
or what we're seeing.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the arousal of the
sympathetic nervous system

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.320 align:middle line:84%
happens this way, once
that energy moves up

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and that gate opens up, it
moves right up into the brain.

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And now the brain goes into a
super conscious or super aware

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.600 align:middle line:84%
state, and the brainwave
patterns that are created

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.090 align:middle line:84%
are called gamma
brainwave patterns.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And gamma brainwave
patterns are associated

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.240 align:middle line:84%
with super consciousness
or super awareness.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And now the person has an
activation in their brain,

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and they're super
conscious, super aware,

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
but the feelings and the
arousal is more like bliss,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%
more like ecstasy.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And the person is having
a tremendous release

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:90%
of energy into the brain.

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense
then, they're almost

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.290 align:middle line:90%
having an orgasm in their brain.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is the release
of the Kundalini.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have an
understanding of pineal gland

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and how to activate it,
in the next episode,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about how the
pineal gland once switched

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
on acts as a radio receiver
to pick up information

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
beyond the senses into
meaningful, lucid imagery,

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the same way that a TV antenna
picks up frequency and decodes

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.170 align:middle line:90%
it into pictures.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we'll
uncover the science

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.650 align:middle line:84%
behind bridging the physics
of frequency and energy

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:90%
with our biology and our brain.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned because I'll be
showing you actual brain

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
scans in real time to prove
to you that it's possible.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe
Dispenza for "Rewired."

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to see you in
the next episode, where

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.390 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.
