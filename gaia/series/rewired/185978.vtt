00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:16.934 align:middle line:84%
>> You've probably heard the
expression, as above, so below.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.729 align:middle line:84%
This is a truth that I've
discovered in my own research.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:84%
What if you are able to
create an inner experience

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.861 align:middle line:84%
in your mind that carries an
amplitude of energy or emotion

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.113 align:middle line:84%
that's greater than a
highly-charged emotional

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.491 align:middle line:84%
experience in your
past, which could

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.745 align:middle line:84%
cause your body to literally
respond to a new mind?

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.916 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that, combining
a clear intention in your mind

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.669 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion in your body,

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:46.088 align:middle line:84%
you can move your brain
and body out of the past

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:47.839 align:middle line:90%
and into a new future?

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.341 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
patients that were

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.468 align:middle line:84%
able to create an inner
experience that was greater

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.554 align:middle line:84%
than their past experiences
were able to change

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.932 align:middle line:90%
the future of their bodies.

00:00:56.932 --> 00:00:59.977 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, they changed
their genetic destiny.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:03.355 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the previous episode,

00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:06.817 align:middle line:10%
we went into depth on the
different types of brainwaves.

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.404 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're going to
discover the power of your mind

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:13.198 align:middle line:84%
and how it can change
your gene expression.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.575 align:middle line:84%
I want to dispel the
myth around genes

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:19.871 align:middle line:84%
and introduce you to a new
science called epigenetics.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.289 align:middle line:84%
It's my hope that
this information

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.458 align:middle line:84%
will help you understand
how to improve

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.503 align:middle line:90%
your life from the inside out.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.923 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.854 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin with
some simple biology.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:49.234 align:middle line:10%
Think of your body as a
protein-producing machine.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.277 align:middle line:10%
Muscle cells make
muscle proteins

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.363 align:middle line:10%
called actin and myosin.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.783 align:middle line:84%
Skin cells make skin proteins
called collagen and elastin.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:01.538 align:middle line:84%
Stomach cells make stomach
proteins called enzymes.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:05.042 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system makes immune
proteins called immunoglobulins

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.668 align:middle line:90%
or antibodies.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.255 align:middle line:84%
Your eye cells make eye
proteins called keratin.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:14.468 align:middle line:84%
And every single cell in your
body, except red blood cells,

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:84%
make proteins, and the
expression of proteins

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.391 align:middle line:84%
is the expression of
life because proteins

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.519 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for the
structure and the function

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.103 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:02:26.103 --> 00:02:28.648 align:middle line:84%
In order for a cell
to make proteins,

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
a gene has to be
stimulated or regulated.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.904 align:middle line:90%
So what are genes then?

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:37.908 align:middle line:84%
Think about genes as a
library of potentials.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:42.287 align:middle line:10%
And so there was a myth after
the human genome was discovered

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:10%
that genes create disease.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you study the
research, less than 1%

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.963 align:middle line:84%
of people on the planet are
born with genetic conditions,

00:02:51.963 --> 00:02:55.966 align:middle line:84%
early onset genetic conditions
like Tay-Sachs disease,

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:59.471 align:middle line:84%
sickle cell anemia,
type 1 diabetes.

00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:05.268 align:middle line:84%
The other 99% is created
from lifestyle, behavior,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:90%
and choices.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.982 align:middle line:10%
So in order for a cell
to make a protein,

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.652 align:middle line:10%
a gene has to be regulated.

00:03:13.652 --> 00:03:18.031 align:middle line:84%
So then, if you understand then
that genes don't create disease

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.034 align:middle line:84%
and the expression of proteins
comes from genes being

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.954 align:middle line:84%
regulated, then what
is causing genes

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to become regulated
or stimulated?

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.583 align:middle line:84%
Well, the latest
research in the field

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:32.879 align:middle line:84%
called epigenetics says that
genes don't create disease.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.258 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment that
signals the gene that

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:38.301 align:middle line:90%
begins to create disease.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:42.597 align:middle line:84%
But it begs the question, how
can two factory workers working

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:46.435 align:middle line:84%
side by side, both exposed
to the same carcinogenic

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:50.021 align:middle line:84%
chemical-- one gets cancer
and the other doesn't.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle line:84%
Surely there must be some
internal order in that person's

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.986 align:middle line:84%
body that's greater
than the conditions

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.362 align:middle line:90%
in their environment.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:01.241 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense then, the
inner environment of the body

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.536 align:middle line:84%
is still the outer
environment of the cell.

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:07.622 align:middle line:84%
So then it's not genes
that create disease,

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:10.167 align:middle line:84%
it's our reaction
to the environment

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
or, better yet, how we begin
to look at the environment that

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.673 align:middle line:90%
influences our emotional state.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.507 align:middle line:84%
And it's our emotions
then that have

00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:24.181 align:middle line:84%
a key factor in sending signals
to cause genes to upregulate

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:27.392 align:middle line:90%
or what we call downregulate.

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:30.395 align:middle line:84%
Now, genes are like
Christmas tree lights.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.814 align:middle line:84%
They're turning on
and off all the time.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.317 align:middle line:84%
But in a sense, they're
not turning on and off.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.068 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
regulated or they're

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.362 align:middle line:84%
getting instructions
from the environment

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:40.655 align:middle line:90%
outside of the cell.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.824 align:middle line:84%
And when they get the
proper instructions,

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:47.245 align:middle line:84%
when the gene gets upregulated,
it makes a healthy protein.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.414 align:middle line:84%
When the cell is
getting information

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.832 align:middle line:84%
that causes it to
contract or limit

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:55.629 align:middle line:84%
its metabolic productions,
it begins to downregulate

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.298 align:middle line:84%
and it starts making
a cheaper protein.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.176 align:middle line:84%
So then, if the
environment signals

00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:04.304 align:middle line:84%
the gene and the end
product of an experience

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.182 align:middle line:84%
in your environment
is called an emotion,

00:05:07.182 --> 00:05:10.810 align:middle line:84%
is it possible then that you
can signal the gene ahead

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:90%
of the environment?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.899 align:middle line:84%
We learned in previous
episodes that the stronger

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.945 align:middle line:84%
the emotion that you feel from
some experience in your life,

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:22.364 align:middle line:84%
the more altered you
feel inside of you,

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:84%
the more you narrow
your focus on the cause.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.995 align:middle line:84%
And the brain freezes the image,
and that's called the memory.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:31.748 align:middle line:84%
And we said that people
think neurologically

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:34.626 align:middle line:84%
within the circuits of
those past experiences,

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.878 align:middle line:84%
and they think chemically
within the boundaries

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:90%
of those emotions.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And how you think
and how you feel

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.676 align:middle line:90%
creates your state of being.

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:46.555 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, highly
charged emotional events

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:49.266 align:middle line:84%
can possibly signal
genes that begin

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.643 align:middle line:90%
to cause the body to change.

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:54.938 align:middle line:84%
So then, if a person is
waking up every morning

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.065 align:middle line:84%
and searching for
the familiar feeling

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.734 align:middle line:84%
that they call
themselves, the moment

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.653 align:middle line:84%
they get in touch with
that feeling that's

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:90%
familiar to them--

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.366 align:middle line:84%
and those feelings are
influencing their thoughts,

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.994 align:middle line:84%
and those thoughts are creating
more of the same chemicals that

00:06:08.994 --> 00:06:10.954 align:middle line:90%
create the same feelings.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:13.498 align:middle line:84%
Then if they're living
by the same emotion,

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.041 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense
they're stimulating

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.545 align:middle line:84%
the same genes in the
same way every single day,

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.047 align:middle line:84%
and now they're headed
for a genetic destiny

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.426 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
new information coming

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.637 align:middle line:84%
from the environment that
could possibly begin to select

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.931 align:middle line:90%
or instruct new genes.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.893 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you look
at two identical twins both

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:37.939 align:middle line:84%
sharing the same genome,
why is it that one dies

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.027 align:middle line:90%
at 54 and the other dies at 86?

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:46.531 align:middle line:84%
Obviously it's their interaction
in the environment, the choices

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.284 align:middle line:84%
that they make, the behaviors
that they demonstrate,

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.746 align:middle line:84%
how they respond to stress,
how resilient they are

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.873 align:middle line:90%
to return back to homeostasis.

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it's
their interaction

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.377 align:middle line:10%
in the environment that's
selecting and instructing

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.463 align:middle line:10%
gene expression.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.340 align:middle line:10%
Now think about this.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.967 align:middle line:10%
When they began to
map the human genome,

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:11.222 align:middle line:10%
they said, OK, the body makes
about 100,000 proteins, which

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:10%
means there should
be 100,000 genes

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:10%
for each one of those proteins.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle line:84%
We have 40 genes that are
called regulatory proteins

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:23.902 align:middle line:84%
or regulatory genes that assist
in making those proteins.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:30.909 align:middle line:84%
So now 100,000 plus 40,000
makes 140,000 proteins,

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:34.162 align:middle line:84%
and there should
be 140,000 genes.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.748 align:middle line:84%
But when they mapped
the human genome,

00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:38.917 align:middle line:84%
they found out that
we only express

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:44.631 align:middle line:90%
as human beings 23,688 genes.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.925 align:middle line:84%
So then how is it
possible then that we

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:49.844 align:middle line:84%
have more proteins that
make up our body than we

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.763 align:middle line:90%
have genes to make them?

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:54.724 align:middle line:84%
Because on one
single gene, there

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:58.228 align:middle line:84%
can be thousands of
different variations

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.897 align:middle line:84%
that begin to cause the
cell to begin to make

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.941 align:middle line:90%
different types of proteins.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So then the
expression of proteins

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.446 align:middle line:90%
is the expression of life.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.032 align:middle line:84%
And so if people are
living in the routine

00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.951 align:middle line:84%
of the predictable
future or they're

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:15.245 align:middle line:84%
memorized to emotions
of their past

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
and they can't think or act
greater than how they feel,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.377 align:middle line:84%
then those series of
events in their lives

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.797 align:middle line:84%
has began to influence
their gene expression.

00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:28.133 align:middle line:84%
Then once the gene
has been signaled

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and the person is
constantly living out

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
of homeostasis or
balance, that imbalance

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:90%
becomes their new balance.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.476 align:middle line:84%
And now the internal
environment of their body

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.229 align:middle line:84%
is sending specific
signals to the cells,

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.857 align:middle line:84%
and the cells are getting
the same instructions.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.152 align:middle line:84%
And the same instructions
produce the same proteins,

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:50.739 align:middle line:84%
and now the person begins
to experience ill health

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:90%
or disease.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.286 align:middle line:84%
So I became very
interested in this topic

00:08:56.286 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
because I started reading
research where scientists

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.085 align:middle line:84%
were taking people that
had type 2 diabetes

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:08.006 align:middle line:84%
and exposing them to
an hour of comedy.

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:10.467 align:middle line:84%
And when they rated
the comedy show,

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.553 align:middle line:84%
many of the participants
rated the show, on a scale

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:18.057 align:middle line:84%
of one to five, a five, which
means, for a whole entire hour,

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.309 align:middle line:90%
they laughed.

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:23.521 align:middle line:84%
But what they were measuring
before and after the comedy

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.191 align:middle line:84%
show caught my
attention because they

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.027 align:middle line:84%
were measuring gene
expression to see

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:33.448 align:middle line:84%
if changing their emotional
state was able to, in one hour,

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.909 align:middle line:90%
select and instruct new genes.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:40.497 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, over 20 genes
were upregulated just

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:42.457 align:middle line:90%
by people changing their mood.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.794 align:middle line:84%
So by changing their
internal state,

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.754 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
select and instruct

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.089 align:middle line:84%
new genes that
made new proteins.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:54.552 align:middle line:84%
People began to function with
diabetes within a normal range

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.138 align:middle line:84%
or slightly elevated
blood sugar levels

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.598 align:middle line:84%
compared to where
their blood sugar

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.392 align:middle line:90%
levels were every single day.

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:05.355 align:middle line:10%
So it caused me to think, OK, if
I could take a group of people

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:09.984 align:middle line:10%
and measure their gene
expression and, for four days,

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:15.532 align:middle line:10%
ask them to think differently,
to make different choices,

00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:21.454 align:middle line:10%
to have new experiences, and to
elevate their emotional state,

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:10%
would it be possible
that, in four days,

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.460 align:middle line:10%
they can begin to change
their gene expression?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.006 align:middle line:84%
So we selected 32 people
in a randomized study.

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
We did some tests to
take some cells out

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.387 align:middle line:90%
of the inside of their mouth.

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:41.724 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to do measurements
before they started a workshop,

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.977 align:middle line:84%
and then we wanted to
take another measurement

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:46.563 align:middle line:84%
to begin to see if
there was a change.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:52.735 align:middle line:84%
And we were measuring 7,500
different gene expressions.

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:56.698 align:middle line:84%
That meant that, when they
stepped outside of routine,

00:10:56.698 --> 00:11:00.743 align:middle line:84%
when they traded certain
emotions for elevated emotions,

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:03.621 align:middle line:84%
by beginning to change
their inner state

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:09.002 align:middle line:84%
would they be able to signal the
gene ahead of the environment?

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:12.422 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we found was
that, in four days,

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:15.508 align:middle line:84%
the gene that makes
new neurons in response

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:19.804 align:middle line:84%
to learning and novel
experiences was activated.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:23.224 align:middle line:84%
The gene for cellular
repair that stimulated

00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:26.352 align:middle line:84%
stem cells, those
transitional cells that

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.439 align:middle line:84%
go to damaged tissues and
repair them, was activated,

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
so there was regeneration
going on in the body.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.903 align:middle line:84%
The gene for
oxidative stress was

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.322 align:middle line:84%
upregulated so the
body could move back

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.699 align:middle line:90%
into normal health and balance.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:45.121 align:middle line:84%
And antioxidants, anticancer,
anti-aging, anti-heart disease,

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
anti-stroke,
anti-neurodegenerative,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
anti-inflammatory,
anti-microbial--

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.462 align:middle line:90%
that gene was signaled.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.714 align:middle line:84%
The gene to build
cellular structures,

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:58.551 align:middle line:84%
the cytoskeleton of the cell,
was activated, more integrity,

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.637 align:middle line:90%
more regeneration in the cell.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:04.599 align:middle line:84%
Three genes were activated
that began to suppress

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.143 align:middle line:90%
cancer growth in tumors.

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:10.855 align:middle line:84%
And the genes for hormonal
balance, metabolic function,

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:15.401 align:middle line:84%
and metabolic order were all
stimulated within four days,

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.446 align:middle line:90%
eight genes upregulated.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:22.992 align:middle line:10%
These are all the genes that
were activated or upregulated

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.079 align:middle line:10%
within just four days.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.832 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense then, you're
not doomed by your genes,

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are your
own genetic engineer.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.506 align:middle line:84%
So in our workshops
around the world,

00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:41.135 align:middle line:84%
we see many people reverse
very serious health conditions

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:45.848 align:middle line:84%
like Parkinson's disease
or MS or lupus or even rare

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:48.726 align:middle line:84%
genetic disorders that
medical science really

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.728 align:middle line:90%
has no solution for.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:55.358 align:middle line:84%
So in order for me to understand
how that was possible,

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.777 align:middle line:84%
by studying gene
expression, we now

00:12:57.777 --> 00:13:00.655 align:middle line:84%
know then that, when
people begin to heal,

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:03.241 align:middle line:84%
they're upregulating
new genes and they're

00:13:03.241 --> 00:13:05.243 align:middle line:84%
downregulating genes
that have to do

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:08.079 align:middle line:90%
with disease or imbalance.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:11.332 align:middle line:84%
So then I started
thinking, is it possible,

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:15.545 align:middle line:84%
by teaching people how to
self-regulate and begin

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:19.132 align:middle line:84%
to change their inner state,
could it lengthen their life

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:20.425 align:middle line:90%
in some way?

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:24.595 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that meditation
or contemplative practices

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:28.641 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis could
influence a person's future

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.561 align:middle line:90%
by adding days to their life?

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.563 align:middle line:10%
So we did another
study, and that study

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:10%
was in Palm Springs,
California in 2017.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.279 align:middle line:10%
And what we did is we
randomly selected 32 people,

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.823 align:middle line:10%
and then we asked
these 32 people

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:47.702 align:middle line:10%
to commit for five
days out of a week

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:52.123 align:middle line:10%
doing some type of meditation
for at least 60 days.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:55.585 align:middle line:84%
But all we wanted them to do
is to begin to self-regulate

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.628 align:middle line:90%
and change their inner state.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:01.382 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we were looking
to measure were telomeres.

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:04.385 align:middle line:84%
Now, telomeres are the
tiny little shoestrings

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.013 align:middle line:90%
on the end of your DNA.

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:12.685 align:middle line:84%
And every time a cell divides,
and cells divide about 50 to 75

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.521 align:middle line:84%
times, the cell
begins to shave off

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.273 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of that shoestring.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:20.485 align:middle line:10%
Now, stress and the
hormones of stress

00:14:20.485 --> 00:14:24.405 align:middle line:10%
actually accelerate the
degeneration of the telomeres

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:10%
and the length of
those telomeres.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.119 align:middle line:84%
So you can determine a
person's biological age,

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.789 align:middle line:84%
which may be in
complete contrast

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.249 align:middle line:90%
to their chronological age.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.252 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to see
then, is it possible

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:40.755 align:middle line:84%
that telomeres could
actually lengthen

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.423 align:middle line:84%
and a person could
lengthen their life

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:45.218 align:middle line:84%
or extend their
life in some way?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So what we found was five
people discontinued doing

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.892 align:middle line:90%
the meditations, which left 27.

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.604 align:middle line:84%
20 out of 27 people lengthened
their telomeres, which

00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:00.358 align:middle line:90%
is about 74% of the study.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:04.403 align:middle line:84%
11 out of the 27 people
increased their telomeres

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.906 align:middle line:90%
by more than 0.05%.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
That's 40% of the
people in the study,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.203 align:middle line:84%
and that adds about four
to eight days of their life

00:15:12.203 --> 00:15:15.081 align:middle line:90%
if they live to at least 75.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.501 align:middle line:84%
Six out of the 27
people significantly

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:24.048 align:middle line:84%
increased their telomeres
between 0.1% and 0.26%.

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.843 align:middle line:84%
That's 22% of the
people involved

00:15:26.843 --> 00:15:32.181 align:middle line:84%
in the study lengthened their
life between eight to 16 days.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.641 align:middle line:90%
Now check this out.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:37.979 align:middle line:84%
One person in the study
increased their telomere length

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.856 align:middle line:90%
within four days.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:43.985 align:middle line:84%
Now, I understand that
telomeres take time to grow.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.196 align:middle line:84%
They're like
fingernails or hair.

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:49.615 align:middle line:84%
And studies that have
been done out of UCLA

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.868 align:middle line:84%
have shown that men
with prostatic cancer

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:54.996 align:middle line:84%
or at least early
onset gene expression

00:15:54.996 --> 00:15:58.875 align:middle line:84%
of possible prostatic
cancer, that in 60 days,

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.878 align:middle line:84%
they were able to upregulate
new genes for health

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:04.672 align:middle line:84%
and downregulate those
genes for disease.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:08.092 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, they began
to lengthen their telomeres.

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.553 align:middle line:84%
So when I talked to
the scientists involved

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:13.055 align:middle line:84%
in the study, I
said to them, I'm

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
aware that telomeres
take time to lengthen,

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.688 align:middle line:84%
but we're seeing
in our workshops

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:23.566 align:middle line:84%
that people are
having instantaneous

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:26.736 align:middle line:84%
change in their health
during a meditation.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
in some way, we're

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.532 align:middle line:90%
seeing an instantaneous change.

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:34.076 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
three-dimensional reality,

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.163 align:middle line:84%
for something to happen
usually takes time.

00:16:37.163 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
But if it's energy
influencing matter

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.296 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening in an instant
and it's not time-dependent,

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:48.841 align:middle line:84%
that energy or the quantum
is influencing matter,

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.844 align:middle line:84%
is it possible then
that someone could

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:55.556 align:middle line:84%
change their telomere
expression within four days

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.725 align:middle line:90%
if it's a quantum phenomenon?

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:00.102 align:middle line:84%
Well, the scientists
paused for about a minute

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:03.814 align:middle line:84%
and finally said,
theoretically, it's possible,

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:08.194 align:middle line:84%
and if one person was able to
do it, I would be impressed.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.945 align:middle line:90%
And I said, that's all I need.

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:13.741 align:middle line:84%
And we had one person able
to significantly change

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
their telomere length
within four days,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.787 align:middle line:84%
and that is a
quantum phenomenon.

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:20.455 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, we
made history to prove

00:17:20.455 --> 00:17:22.833 align:middle line:84%
that you can lengthen
your life by changing

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.586 align:middle line:90%
your internal state.

00:17:25.586 --> 00:17:29.215 align:middle line:84%
So how do we change
gene expression?

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
When people have highly
charged emotional experiences

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.972 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to change
their emotional state

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.598 align:middle line:84%
and it changes their
brain structure,

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:40.476 align:middle line:84%
it changes the mapping
of their brain,

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.687 align:middle line:84%
how is it possible
then that they

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:46.023 align:middle line:84%
can begin to select
and instruct new genes

00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:47.942 align:middle line:90%
and to change their health?

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:51.779 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you have an internal
experience in your mind

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.782 align:middle line:84%
that carries an amplitude
of energy that's

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:58.077 align:middle line:84%
greater than the hardwired
programs in your brain

00:17:58.077 --> 00:18:00.705 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
conditioning in your body,

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
you will become
biologically changed.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.629 align:middle line:84%
Here's a person going along
living their normal life,

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:11.173 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, they
have a highly charged

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:90%
emotional experience.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.053 align:middle line:84%
That experience then
wires and enriches

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:17.972 align:middle line:84%
the circuits in
their brain, and it

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:21.892 align:middle line:84%
begins to send the chemical
emotional signal to their body.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:23.769 align:middle line:84%
And it's that chemical
emotional signature

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.188 align:middle line:84%
to the body that
begins to change

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.316 align:middle line:90%
the person's state of being.

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:29.567 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we could say their body
and brain are now in the past,

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.617 align:middle line:84%
and that event has
changed them biologically.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:42.747 align:middle line:84%
So how are they going to change
the biology of their circuitry,

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:45.583 align:middle line:84%
their neurochemistry, their
hormone expression, and even

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.044 align:middle line:90%
their gene expression?

00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.212 align:middle line:84%
What happens for
most people is they

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:52.506 align:middle line:84%
begin to create beliefs
about themselves

00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:55.676 align:middle line:84%
and their lives from
past experiences.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.511 align:middle line:84%
They are the thoughts
neurologically

00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.972 align:middle line:84%
and the feelings chemically
that they embrace

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.808 align:middle line:84%
within the biology of
their past experiences

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.644 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately becomes
their state of being,

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:08.981 align:middle line:84%
because how you think
and how you feel

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.192 align:middle line:90%
creates your state of being.

00:19:11.192 --> 00:19:15.154 align:middle line:84%
So then when a person
has an inner experience

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:19.158 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment that
carries an amplitude of energy

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:22.036 align:middle line:84%
or the emotion
inwardly is greater

00:19:22.036 --> 00:19:24.997 align:middle line:84%
than the shock or the
betrayal from the past,

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.876 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense then, when the
emotional quotient is greater

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.337 align:middle line:84%
than the past
experience, it's going

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:36.384 align:middle line:84%
to begin to rewire the brain and
send a new emotional signature

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
beginning to condition the
body in that present moment

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.888 align:middle line:90%
to a new mind.

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.599 align:middle line:84%
And we could say then,
your biology literally

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:49.313 align:middle line:84%
changes or, better yet,
the past no longer exists.

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:51.816 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to tell a story
to be able to bring this

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:90%
all together.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:57.571 align:middle line:84%
We had a 72-year-old woman
come to a week-long event

00:19:57.571 --> 00:20:00.783 align:middle line:84%
in Vancouver, British
Columbia, and this woman

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:03.869 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with
Parkinson's disease.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.539 align:middle line:84%
And Parkinson's
disease is a deficiency

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.916 align:middle line:90%
in dopamine in the brain.

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.044 align:middle line:84%
And when there's not enough
dopamine in the brain, all

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:14.338 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, the upper
motor neurons in the brain

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:17.675 align:middle line:84%
can't communicate very well
with each other, and the effect,

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:84%
it begins to produce
involuntary tremors

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:25.266 align:middle line:84%
and this type of paralysis
called spastic paralysis.

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:28.769 align:middle line:84%
You see a limitation
in motor function,

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:31.105 align:middle line:84%
or when a person
tries to move, they

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.315 align:middle line:90%
have these involuntary tremors.

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:37.194 align:middle line:84%
Try as they may to control
it with their conscious mind,

00:20:37.194 --> 00:20:38.195 align:middle line:90%
they can't.

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:41.866 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, a lot of times when
they get anxious or nervous,

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:44.368 align:middle line:10%
their tremors or their
condition amplifies.

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:48.706 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is a gene that
has been downregulated.

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:52.376 align:middle line:84%
So then this woman,
in one meditation,

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:57.006 align:middle line:84%
had one inner experience that
literally was so profound,

00:20:57.006 --> 00:21:02.136 align:middle line:84%
it was so elevated that, when
she came back to her senses,

00:21:02.136 --> 00:21:05.389 align:middle line:84%
she literally began to
express different proteins.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:09.602 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, she changed
her body by thought alone.

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we brought
her onto the stage,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and her condition
before this event

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.236 align:middle line:90%
was that she couldn't swallow.

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't chew her food.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.327 align:middle line:84%
She had saliva constantly
running off of her mouth.

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.371 align:middle line:84%
She had to consistently
use a tissue,

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.582 align:middle line:90%
and she couldn't stand up.

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:36.295 align:middle line:84%
After that one inner event that
carried an amplitude of energy

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:39.173 align:middle line:84%
that was greater than the
hardwired programs in her brain

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:40.883 align:middle line:84%
and the normal
emotional feelings

00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:43.135 align:middle line:84%
that she felt on
a daily basis, we

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.721 align:middle line:84%
could say that, in
that moment, genes

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:49.433 align:middle line:84%
began to become upregulated
and new information was

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:51.477 align:middle line:90%
coming into her body.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.604 align:middle line:84%
She stood on the
stage and she said,

00:21:53.604 --> 00:21:56.649 align:middle line:84%
after all these years,
all the therapies, all

00:21:56.649 --> 00:22:00.319 align:middle line:84%
the different drugs, all the
different surgeries that I had,

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.239 align:middle line:84%
nothing seemed to
change this condition,

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.241 align:middle line:90%
and now I can speak better.

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.784 align:middle line:90%
I can chew my food.

00:22:06.784 --> 00:22:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I can blow my nose.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.662 align:middle line:90%
I can swallow.

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:13.707 align:middle line:84%
And for the audience, she
sat down and then stood up.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:17.127 align:middle line:84%
And she literally had
a significant change

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:23.008 align:middle line:84%
in gene expression, and it
happened in one instant.

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:24.927 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the same
means, there are

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:28.222 align:middle line:84%
people that have had
abusive childhoods

00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:30.558 align:middle line:84%
with alcoholic
parents where they

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:33.936 align:middle line:84%
were abused every single day
when their father came home

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:37.189 align:middle line:84%
from work, and it
wasn't just one event.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:40.609 align:middle line:10%
It was a series of
several events over time

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.945 align:middle line:10%
that began to
select and instruct

00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:47.658 align:middle line:10%
genes that caused them to
have a rare genetic condition.

00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:53.664 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this case, this person,
it took them almost two years

00:22:53.664 --> 00:22:57.668 align:middle line:84%
to literally consistently
knock on the genetic door

00:22:57.668 --> 00:23:00.963 align:middle line:84%
and break out of the patterns
of their normal thinking

00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:02.881 align:middle line:90%
and the way they typically felt.

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.509 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
every single day,

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.054 align:middle line:84%
they understood that they were
their own genetic engineer.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.223 align:middle line:84%
And every single day,
they were working

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:14.018 align:middle line:84%
on going from the old
self to the new self.

00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:16.395 align:middle line:84%
And of course, life
isn't that linear.

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.022 align:middle line:84%
They had their
own stress events.

00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:19.857 align:middle line:90%
They had their own difficulties.

00:23:19.857 --> 00:23:21.817 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
financial problems.

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:23.569 align:middle line:90%
They had family dynamics.

00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:27.239 align:middle line:84%
And because they were living
life, it took them more time.

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:31.118 align:middle line:84%
But every day, they were
shaving down a little bit more

00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:34.079 align:middle line:84%
of those emotions from
the past and learning

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.498 align:middle line:84%
how to elevate their
emotional state.

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.293 align:middle line:84%
And they were practicing
every single day,

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:42.504 align:middle line:84%
combining a clear intention
with an elevated emotion

00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:45.049 align:middle line:84%
and moving into a
new state of being.

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:48.886 align:middle line:84%
Now, this person's health
condition was very limited.

00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:53.974 align:middle line:84%
They had the very scaffolding
and the structure of their bones

00:23:53.974 --> 00:23:57.144 align:middle line:84%
were degenerating where
they had numerous fractures,

00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:00.064 align:middle line:84%
and the doctors told them
there was no solution

00:24:00.064 --> 00:24:02.441 align:middle line:90%
for this genetic condition.

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:05.736 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand then,
if the scaffolding of bones

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:08.906 align:middle line:84%
is made of proteins and
that you could actually

00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:13.285 align:middle line:84%
begin to upregulate those
genes, every single day,

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.663 align:middle line:84%
she was knocking on
that genetic door

00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:17.581 align:middle line:84%
and shaving down
that emotional state

00:24:17.581 --> 00:24:21.168 align:middle line:84%
and changing her thoughts and
feelings that, in two years,

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:23.462 align:middle line:84%
she reached the
point in her life

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:27.841 align:middle line:84%
where she was so in love with
herself, so in love with life,

00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:31.887 align:middle line:84%
so grateful to be alive that
she no longer cared if she even

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:33.722 align:middle line:90%
had the condition any longer.

00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:35.641 align:middle line:90%
She went to the hospital.

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:39.269 align:middle line:84%
They did the urine samples to
determine if the disease was

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.314 align:middle line:84%
still present, and she
got the call the next day

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:45.401 align:middle line:84%
that the gene was
literally upregulated

00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and her condition
was back to normal.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.073 align:middle line:84%
Now this person to
this day still has

00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:53.158 align:middle line:90%
the change in her health.

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:56.495 align:middle line:84%
Now, when she stood on the
stage and told the story

00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:58.831 align:middle line:84%
to the audience,
there was a woman

00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:02.793 align:middle line:84%
in the audience with the
same rare genetic condition.

00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:06.296 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at that person
and said, if she could do it,

00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And this woman reversed the
same rare genetic juvenile onset

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.847 align:middle line:90%
condition within three months.

00:25:14.847 --> 00:25:17.433 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
person who had the healing

00:25:17.433 --> 00:25:19.268 align:middle line:84%
broke the four-minute
mile and it

00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:22.855 align:middle line:84%
made it easier for the
next person to do the same.

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
starts to happen in this work.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.944 align:middle line:84%
I believe that health
and wellness can become

00:25:28.944 --> 00:25:31.864 align:middle line:90%
as infectious as disease.

00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:34.867 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've shown you the
supernatural ability of how

00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:37.494 align:middle line:84%
your genes can be
reprogrammed, how

00:25:37.494 --> 00:25:41.081 align:middle line:84%
can we use this information
to heal your body by thought

00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.585 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what's the
next level for you?

00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:48.338 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, I
want to ask the question,

00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:52.342 align:middle line:84%
if in double blind and triple
blind placebo studies where

00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:58.849 align:middle line:84%
subjects respond to a sugar pill
and the changes result from 10%

00:25:58.849 --> 00:26:01.894 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
100%, do you really

00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:05.481 align:middle line:84%
need a sugar pill begin
to heal your body?

00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:09.234 align:middle line:84%
In other words, is it possible
to heal your body by thought

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:10.444 align:middle line:90%
alone?

00:26:10.444 --> 00:26:13.113 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Dr. Joe
Dispenza for "Rewired,"

00:26:13.113 --> 00:26:15.073 align:middle line:84%
and I hope to see you
in the next episode

00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
where we go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.497 align:middle line:90%
