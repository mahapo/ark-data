00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that your
subjective mind has an effect

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:90%
on the objective world?

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that mind and matter
are so intimately connected

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that it's impossible
to separate the two?

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
If that is true, how can
you use this information

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:84%
to not only change your body,
but to change your life?

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:10%
In the previous episode,
we went into depth

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:10%
on the understanding
of the placebo effect.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're
going to discover

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.550 align:middle line:90%
the quantum model of reality.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
What you're about to
learn may open the door

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to show you how your thoughts
literally affect matter,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:90%
that your thoughts matter.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.208 align:middle line:90%
Let's begin.

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:52.694 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:52.694 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:10%
Much of what we understood
about the physics

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:10%
of the nature of reality before
the 1900s was categorized

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.440 align:middle line:10%
under the concept
of Newtonian physics

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:10%
or what we call
classical physics.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:10%
Now think of classical
physics or Newtonian physics

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:10%
as the physics of
the predictable.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:10%
And when Newton
had his realization

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.440 align:middle line:10%
when the apple
fell from the tree,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:10%
the realization
basically said things

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:10%
are moving in a smooth
and continuous fashion.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And when the apple
falls from the tree,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
as long as I know the
distance it's falling,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I can determine how long
it's going to take to land.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And because of
Newtonian physics,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
we can shoot a rocket to
the Moon with accuracy.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You'll know the exact time
it takes for you to travel

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:90%
from Los Angeles to London.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We can determine then the
trajectory of planets rotating

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:90%
around the Sun.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And because of
Newtonian physics,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
we have enough understanding
to be able to navigate

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:90%
in our three-dimensional world.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So think of Newtonian physics as
the physics of the predictable

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:84%
or the physics of
the very large.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, at the turn of
the 19th century,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:10%
Albert Einstein and
Max Planck began

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:10%
to study the subatomic world.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And what they were interested
in doing was just like an apple

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
falling from the
tree, they wanted

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to begin to disturb the
electrons that were existing

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:90%
around the nucleus of the atom.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have seen
that classical model

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
of the atom, where you have
the atom being like the Sun

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and you have all these
electrons rotating around it.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was the model that was
existing up until that point.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
When they began to disturb that
electron and add energy to it,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
they expected that
the electron would

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
move towards a
center of gravity,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
towards the nucleus
of the atom, just

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
like an apple falling
from the tree,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that it would fall in a very
smooth and continuous fashion,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
a very predictable way.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But what they discovered
is that the subatomic world

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
of those electrons
behaved very differently

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
that the very large world of
apples falling from trees.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
The electron would gain
energy and lose energy.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Then it would gain
energy and lose energy.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:10%
And instead of it
falling from the tree

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:10%
in a smooth continuous way,
like rolling down a hill,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:10%
it was more like a ball dropping
down stairs, gaining energy,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:10%
losing energy, gaining
energy, losing energy.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that the
subatomic world no longer

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:90%
behaved like the large world.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So then they began to try
to measure the electron.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered
was that model

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
of classical physics, where it
said the nucleus of the atom

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
was like the Sun and the
planets rotating around it,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:90%
isn't actually the truth.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The way it really is is
that there's a nucleus

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a cloud
of energy called the waves.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And in that cloud of energy, the
electron could exist anywhere.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me give you an example.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.160 align:middle line:84%
If you blew up the
nucleus of the atom

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
to the size of a Volkswagen
Bug, the electron

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:90%
would be the size of a pea.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Now where that
electron could exist

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
would be the size of the state
of Utah or twice the size

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:90%
the country of Cuba.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a lot of
possibility of where

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:90%
that electron could be.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
When the field of
probability is existing,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
the electron exists as
possibility or potential.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So when they began to
measure the electron,

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
they began to look for
it, all of a sudden

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
that energy collapsed
into a particle, called

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:84%
collapsing the wave
function or a quantum event.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:10%
Subjective mind
for the first time

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:10%
had an effect on
the objective world

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:10%
and the observer
effect was born.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, here's the cool part.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
The moment they took their
attention off the electron

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and they no longer put
their awareness on it,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that electron, that particle,
turned back into energy

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and turned back
into possibility.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may say, well, yes,
that observer effect, mind

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and matter, are intimately
related on a subatomic level,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:84%
but does it really affect our
life in large-scale events?

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Does the observer effect
only work for the tiny

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:90%
and not for the large?

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe we're
just poor observers.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can
learn how to sharpen

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:90%
our skill of observation.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So before we go
any further, let's

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
talk about the definition
of the quantum field.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Think of the quantum field as
an invisible field of energy

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
that exists beyond
this space and time.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%
There are no people there.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:90%
There are no things.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:90%
There's no place to go.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:90%
There isn't even time.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.440 align:middle line:84%
It's one infinite field
of energy and information,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing
physical or material.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can experience the
quantum field with your senses.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So quantum physicists for
almost a hundred years

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to understand
this unifying field.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, they've given
the name to the quantum field

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:90%
as the unified field.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're
interested in studying

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics of unifying
all the forces that

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:84%
begin to cause order in our
three-dimensional world.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Think about the Big Bang.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:84%
After the Big Bang,
after that explosion,

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
there was tremendous
amount of order

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.950 align:middle line:84%
that was created
after that explosion.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
If you observed an
explosion that took place

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
in this three-dimensional
reality,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:90%
there's typically disorder.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And after the Big Bang, we have
order, some unifying field,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
some intelligence,
that's governing

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So then what are
the forces then that

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
begin to unify all of
these different elements

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.620 align:middle line:90%
to create such order?

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physicists have come
up with all different theories

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:84%
to begin to understand
with the mathematics

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
how all this energy works
to create such order.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So think of the unified field
as an invisible field of energy

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that connects and organizes
everything physical.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
We've talked in
previous episodes

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.675 align:middle line:84%
about living by the
hormones of stress.

00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we're under the
gun of the fight or flight

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
nervous system and the
brain and body are aroused,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
the very chemicals of
stress heighten our senses.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And we become materialists,
perceiving our world

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:90%
in three-dimensional reality.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So then when we feel
the chemicals of stress

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and we're living as matter,
local in space and time,

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
then we feel separate
from everything

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.310 align:middle line:90%
material or physical.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So think about the
three-dimensional reality

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
is giving us the illusion
of everything separate.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
In the unified field, the
quantum field, the zero point

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
field, that universal energy
that's governing and creating

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
order in all
three-dimensional reality,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
that energy has nothing
to do with separation.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We would say that this
energy is about connection.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
the material world

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
is interacting with each
other in terms of energy.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So the physical reality, we
experience with our senses.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:10%
If we can't see our dreams,
we can't smell them,

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:10%
we can't hear them, we can't
feel them, we can't taste them,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.120 align:middle line:10%
they don't exist for us.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum model
reality is a reality

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
that exists beyond our senses.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
You can only experience
it with your awareness.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So in three-dimensional
reality, it

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
has everything that's material,
has height, and depth,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and width.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
The quantum field is made of
energy, frequency, vibration,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:90%
information, consciousness.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the realm of thought.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So then if we're matter
trying to change matter,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
it will always take time
for us to manifest reality.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we live in a
realm where there's

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.400 align:middle line:90%
an infinite amount of space.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And we experience time
by moving through space.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And so here, I am Joe Dispenza,
one point of consciousness,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:90%
one point of awareness.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I have my attention on
another point of consciousness,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:90%
let's say my car.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to go from
one point of awareness

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to another point of
awareness, I would have

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:90%
to move my body through space.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I move my body
through space, it takes time.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So then based on my
experience of the past

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and how fast I walk,
I can determine

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
about how long it's going to
take me to get from one point

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:90%
to another point.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So then, here's
me, Joe Dispenza,

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and then here's my
dreams, way over there.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And most people
then begin to try

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
to predict when their dreams
are going to come true.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So they do that based on their
past experience of linear time.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So then their dreams
are way out there.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And now they have
to move their body

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
through space, matter to
matter, every single day,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:90%
to arrive at their dreams.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it
takes time to do that.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So if reality is both
a particle and a wave,

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
if it's both matter
and energy, and we're

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:84%
functioning in this
three-dimensional world and all

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of our attention is on
everything material,

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and we understood
from previous episodes

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that if you're living
in the familiar past

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
or you're living in
the predictable future,

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
then for the most part
you're living in the known.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sweet spot of
the generous present moment

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:90%
is called the unknown.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that unknown is where
all possibilities exist.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's demystify
the quantum field.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
If you took away all the
people, all the objects, all

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the places, you
took away the Sun,

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:84%
you took away the Earth, the
Moon, the planets, the stars,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
the light from the
stars, the galaxies,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.340 align:middle line:84%
you took away everything
material, what would you

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.660 align:middle line:84%
be left with, and
infinite void of anything

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:90%
physical or material.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And that fertile
void, just because you

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
can't see something, doesn't
mean it doesn't exist.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And that fertile void is filled
with possibilities, filled

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:90%
with unknown experiences.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So then how do we get from
the known to the unknown?

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
How do we get from the material
world to the immaterial world?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
How do we get from the world
of the senses to the world

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:90%
beyond the senses?

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
How do we move from the world
of the predictable to the world

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:90%
of the unpredictable?

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:84%
How do we move from
three-dimensional reality

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
into other dimensions
or other realities?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk to you
about the formula that

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:90%
allows you to get there.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So in other episodes,
we talked briefly

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:90%
about getting beyond the self.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
That most people spend
the majority of their life

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:84%
living in separation, instead
of living in connection.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.120 align:middle line:10%
And because they're feeling
local in space and time

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:10%
as a body, then they're
using their body

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:10%
to begin to create
outcomes in their life,

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:10%
they'll spend the majority
of their life developing

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:10%
an identity that's connected
to knowing someone,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:10%
to living somewhere, to
owning certain things

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:10%
and living in certain
places at certain times.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes the
autobiographical self,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that is stored in the
thinking neocortex.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:10%
So then when a person
goes from a narrow focus

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:10%
to a broad focus, and they
take their attention off

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.010 align:middle line:10%
of everything material,
and they begin

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:10%
to open their awareness
not to matter,

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:10%
but broadening their
focus and tuning

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:10%
into energy, or information,
or nothing material,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:10%
the act of opening
their awareness

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.680 align:middle line:10%
allows them to begin to
change their brainwaves.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And you learn then that
if you do this properly,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:84%
as you slow your
brainwaves down,

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
you begin to get beyond
the analytical mind.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not thinking
about anybody; if you're not

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
feeling the pain in
your body; if you're not

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
thinking about
checking your text;

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're not thinking
about where you need to go,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
or where you're sitting,
or how much time you have,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
you would begin to
no longer activate

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.660 align:middle line:84%
the circuits in your
autobiographical thinking

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:84%
brain, that has everything
to do with everything

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:90%
known in your life.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to suppress
this part of your brain,

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the seat of your identity,
your personality,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and you slow your brainwaves
down, as you do that

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to tune in to
energy, that unifying field,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
its signature is oneness, or
wholeness, or greater levels

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:90%
of order or connection.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
become aware of it

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and put your attention
on it, and as you

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:84%
begin to sense the vastness
of that empty void,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to focus
on nothing but energy,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.350 align:middle line:84%
if you can begin to keep
your attention on it,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
it will begin to create
more order or more coherence

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So not only do you
change your brainwaves,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
but as you learn you create
more order and more coherence

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:84%
because the brain's
attention is on something

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:90%
that's highly orderly.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And we could say
that the moment you

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
take your attention off your
body, you go from a somebody

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.593 align:middle line:90%
to a nobody.

00:14:37.593 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
The moment you
take your attention

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.427 align:middle line:84%
off your identity
that's connected

00:14:40.427 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
to certain people, and certain
things, or times, and places,

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
you will become no
one, in nothing,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:90%
in nowhere and no time.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is the moment you
become pure consciousness

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and you disconnect
from everything

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
known in your
three-dimensional reality.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And we could say then, if you're
no longer in the familiar past

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
or the predictable future, you
are falling into the eternal

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
quantum model of reality,

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.020 align:middle line:84%
all possibilities exist
in the eternal now.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
That means then, in the now
you're no longer in the known.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're in the unknown.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all
possibilities exist.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So to get beyond
your self then, means

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
you have to become
pure consciousness.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been saying, if
where you place your attention

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
is where you place
your energy, and you

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:84%
take all of your attention
off everything material,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and you began to become nobody,
no one, no thing, nowhere

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and no time, and you became pure
consciousness, what if then you

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
allowed yourself as an awareness
to stay in the unknown?

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If you can linger without
a name, without a face,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
without a gender, without your
pain, without your disease,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
without all the
relationships you have,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:84%
without your past or
your predictable future,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense then
that the longer

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
you linger in the unknown,
where all possibilities exist,

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:84%
by very theory the more you
would create new possibilities

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.460 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So then just like in the
quantum physics experiments,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
where they were
observing the electron,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and the electron went from
a cloud of possibilities,

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.870 align:middle line:84%
the wave function,
and it collapsed

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
into a particle, all of a sudden
when they turned their back

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and no longer looked or
observed the electron,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:90%
it turned into possibility.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
It's possible then that when
you disconnect from everything

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:84%
known in your life, and you're
no longer observing your life

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
from the same level of
mind, that your life can

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.590 align:middle line:84%
turn into possibilities,
just like the electron turns

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:90%
into possibilities.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting to the
present moment is the work.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start noticing
that your attention is going

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
to memories of the
past, that are connected

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to certain emotions in
your meditation, that's

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
the habit of how you've been
thinking up until this point.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
And you have to break
that habit, which

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
means that you have to
return your attention back

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.060 align:middle line:84%
into the present moment
and unfold as an awareness

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:90%
back into possibility.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
And every time you do
that, that's a victory.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
When you start to notice that
you want to get up and quit,

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:84%
and you settle it back down
into the present moment

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and you unfold back into
possibilities, that means then

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
you're telling your body
that it's no longer the mind.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And you're executing
a will that's

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:90%
greater than the program.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep doing
that over and over again,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
the body will begin to surrender
into the present moment,

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:90%
just like training an animal.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Once it finally can surrender
into the present moment,

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
if where you place
your attention

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
is where you place your energy,
and all of your attention

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and energy is in
the present moment,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of energy
to do amazing things.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.190 align:middle line:84%
So then all those possibilities
that exist in the quantum field

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
exists as electromagnetic
possibilities.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.920 align:middle line:84%
They exist as
frequencies that you

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:90%
have to begin to connect to.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So then, what are
the ingredients

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to tune into
those potentials that already

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:90%
exist in the quantum field?

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Well, that requires two things.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
A coherent brain, that
is a clear intention,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and an elevated,
heartfelt emotion.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
That is what begins
to open our hearts

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and creates coherence
in our heart.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So then if you are
disintegrated in your brain,

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:36.923 align:middle line:84%
and that you have
incoherence in your brain,

00:18:36.923 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't
trained your heart

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to begin to become more
orderly and produce

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
a powerful magnetic
signature, then you

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
can't read information
or broadcast frequencies

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.540 align:middle line:90%
into the field.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
In a sense then, you're on
the wrong radio station.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And the more coherent
your brain is,

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
the more coherent your
heart is, the more you

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:90%
can tune into those potentials.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's demystify
the process.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So many people spend their
entire life creating a lack.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:84%
They see something
that they want,

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
like a new car or
a new wardrobe,

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and they notice that
they don't have it.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they notice
that they don't have it,

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
they experience
separation or lack.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So what they start
to do is they start

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:90%
thinking about having that car.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.840 align:middle line:84%
They close their eyes
and in a period of time

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.937 align:middle line:84%
they start seeing themselves
actually driving the car.

00:19:24.937 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But when they open
their eyes and they

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
realize that the car
hasn't manifested,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.110 align:middle line:84%
they start
experiencing more lack.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So then they try
harder to get it.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And how do they try?

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They force, they wish, they
control because they're matter

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.820 align:middle line:90%
or trying to change matter.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Once you begin to
open your heart,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
once energy makes it to
the center right here,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
this is our connection
to the unified field.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the center
we create from.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the center of
wholeness or oneness.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.470 align:middle line:84%
This is where our
divinity begins.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
This is the union of polarity
or the union of opposites.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And once energy makes it to
this center, all of a sudden,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
like dropping
pebble, after pebble,

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
after pebble into
water, it begins

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
to create a resonant
magnetic field.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that field can be
up to three meters wide.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're starting
to open up and become

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:84%
more energy and less matter,
more wave and less particle.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And now, once energy
makes it here,

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that energy can carry
information, or a thought,

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
or intention.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to lay
the thought on that energy

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:84%
because that energy is
consistent with your healing.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
That energy is consistent
with your new dream.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
The energy is consistent
with your new job

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:90%
or your new relationship.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
That energy can carry the
thought of your dreams.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
The energy of
suffering can't carry

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:84%
the thought of your
wealth because it's not

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
consistent with that energy.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So then when you begin
to open your heart

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and you raise your
energy, and you

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
begin to lay the
thought on it, think

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of the thought as the electrical
charge in the quantum field.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And think of the feeling as the
magnetic charge in the quantum

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And how you think
and how you feel

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
begins to broadcast new
energy and new information

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:90%
into the field.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever you
broadcast into the field

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
is your experiment with destiny.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So then when you get really
good at creating brain coherence

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and heart coherence,
and you know

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
how to elevate your
emotional state,

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to feel the
emotion of your future

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
before it's made
manifest, then you're

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:90%
no longer living in lack.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
You feel like your dream
has already happened.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So then when there's
a vibrational match

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
between your energy and a
potential that already exists

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum field,
now you no longer

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
have to go anywhere
to get your dreams.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Now you are connected
to that field

00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of information, that's connected
to everything material.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a
vibrational match

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:84%
between your energy and that
potential, now all of a sudden

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:84%
you'll begin to
collapse time and space.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And you'll begin to draw
the experience to you.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, you no longer have
to go anywhere to get it.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
You are the vortex
to your creation.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
So think of it like this.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The thought sends the
signal out and the feeling

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:90%
draws the event back to you.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you are intending
on having a future,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're waiting
for the experience

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to happen so you can feel
the emotions of your wealth,

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or of your freedom, of
your new relationship,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
then you're sending
the thought out,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.852 align:middle line:84%
but you're not drawing the
experience back to you.

00:22:42.852 --> 00:22:43.935 align:middle line:90%
So here's a great example.

00:22:43.935 --> 00:22:47.075 align:middle line:84%
The HeartMath Institute
did a novel study,

00:22:47.075 --> 00:22:48.450 align:middle line:84%
where they took
a group of people

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:90%
that were expert prayers.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And they set three vials
of DNA in front of them.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
them, now listen,

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
with all of your intent, we
want you to see in your mind

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.637 align:middle line:90%
the DNA winding or unwinding.

00:23:03.637 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And just keep doing.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Keep visualizing it
winding and unwinding.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:10%
That's the concept of the mind.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:10%
They did it over and over
again, over and over again.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.720 align:middle line:10%
And they checked to see if the
DNA was changed in any way.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the experiment,

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:90%
the DNA was never changed.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Intention did nothing
to effect the DNA.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So then they said to them,
OK, now open your heart,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:90%
create heart coherence.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And just generate that
signal out into the field.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's see if that energy
begins to affect the DNA.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the experiment,
they checked the DNA.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was no
change in the DNA.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:84%
But when they said
to those people, now

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:84%
we want you to see
the DNA unwinding

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and we want you to open
your heart and give thanks,

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
that it actually unwound
before it occurred.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The moment they combined
that clear intention

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, more than 20%

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA unwound
at a remote location.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:90%
A thought sends the signal out.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
The feeling draws
the event back.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, as you
begin to open your heart

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
and broaden your field, that
energy is the handmaiden

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:84%
or it's the carrier
of that thought.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And now you can begin to
affect the nature of reality.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So a fundamental
question is, what are you

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:90%
broadcasting on a daily basis?

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:84%
If you finish your
meditation and you combine

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.690 align:middle line:84%
a clear intention with
an elevated emotion,

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and your heart is open,
and you feel connected

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
to the energy of
your future, it's

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
your job to maintain that
modified state of mind

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:90%
and body your entire day.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And if you can, get ready.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Something unusual is going
to happen in your life.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to come in a
way that you least expect,

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
that surprises you
and leaves no doubt

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's come from your
connection to the field.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And you won't be able to predict
when it's going to happen

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:90%
or how it's going to happen.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
looking to predict it,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
you're laying down a
known over an unknown.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to live in the
realm of possibility,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:90%
in a new state of being.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you
say I got frustrated

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.940 align:middle line:84%
because of a co-worker, I got
angry because I was in traffic,

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and you disconnected from the
energy of your future, now

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
you're back to the
energy of your past.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And don't expect anything
to change in your life.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So then our job then is
to be able to regulate

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
the state with our eyes open,
as well as our eyes closed.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And the side effect of
this when done properly

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:84%
are those synchronicities,
are those serendipities,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
are those coincidences that
are beginning to come to us.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And we no longer have
to go and get it now.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:10%
We are now a vibrational match
with everything between now

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:10%
and who we are in our future.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And now we are
collapsing our future

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and bringing it towards us.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, that I've shown you
how your mind can influence

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
your outer environment,
it's my hope

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.270 align:middle line:84%
that you'll use some of this
to begin to collapse space

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and time into a new reality.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we're going to discuss

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
space-time and time-space,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a roadmap in
order to create from the field,

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.530 align:middle line:90%
instead of from matter.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host Dr. Joe
Dispenza, for "Rewired."

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hope to see you in
the next episode, where

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:84%
you go beyond the ordinary
into the extraordinary.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:90%
