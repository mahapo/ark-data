can give someone a sugar pill,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
a saline injection, or
perform some false surgery

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:84%
or treatment, and a certain
percentage of those people will

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
accept, believe, and surrender
to the thought without

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
analyzing it that they're
getting the real substance

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.620 align:middle line:90%
or treatment?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
to produce the exact
pharmacy of chemicals

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
equal to the substance that
they think they're taking.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Is it the inert substance
that's doing the healing,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
or is it the body's
innate capacity to heal?

I'm your host, Dr. Joe Dispenza,
and in the previous episode,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:10%
we went into depth on the
understanding of epigenetics

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.183 align:middle line:10%
and how you have the ability
to change your gene expression.

00:00:57.183 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're
going to discover

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:90%
the power of suggestibility.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
This will help you understand
that your nervous system can be

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.478 align:middle line:90%
the greatest pharmacist of all.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%
What is the placebo?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
The word placebo comes
from the word to please.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:10%
And all throughout antiquity
in ancient folklore,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:10%
there have been numerous
examples for thousands of years

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:10%
where people were reporting
significant changes

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:10%
in their health, whether
they were associating

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:10%
that change with some place,
some symbol, some apparition,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:10%
or some ritual.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But in some way, there was
an instantaneous change

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:90%
in the person's health.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
There was an American
physician during one

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:84%
of the wars who was doing
surgery on wounded soldiers,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor ran
out of morphine.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And he had to come up
with a way to continue

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.610 align:middle line:90%
doing the surgeries.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Instead of using morphine, he
used a simple saline injection.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And when he gave the
soldiers a saline injection,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
he noticed that he was able
to perform those surgeries

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
with very little response
or pain from the subjects

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
that he was doing surgery on.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And this began the
study of placebos.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, in most
scientific studies that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:84%
are being done on
drugs to this day,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
no research experiment
is done without

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:84%
a double blind or triple
blind placebo study.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
every single drug

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
has to be measured
against the placebo,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.900 align:middle line:84%
because in most
scientific studies,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
there are changes
in a person's health

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that range between 10% of
the time to 100% of the time

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:90%
when they're given a placebo.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the subject
doesn't even know

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
if they're getting
the real substance

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:90%
or they're getting the placebo.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
triple blind studies,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
the doctors or the
researchers don't even

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:84%
know who's getting
the placebo and who's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:90%
getting the real substance.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So now most studies
always consider the mind

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to be an important
element in how

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:90%
it affects the person's body.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:90%
So how are placebos effective?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about it.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:84%
You have pain, you
have a symptom.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Someone gives you a pill,
and you swallow that pill,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and within an hour, you start
noticing a change in your pain

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So then the next day,
you have pain again.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:90%
You're given that pill.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:90%
You look at the pill.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.090 align:middle line:90%
You swallow it again.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
You notice that your
pain levels diminish.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
You start noticing a change
in your internal state,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to think
about what causes it,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and you start to associate
the change in your inner state

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:90%
with something outside of you.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Keep doing it again the
next day, doing it again

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
the next day, do it
again the next day,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and then the day
after, give someone

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
a pill that looks just
like that previous pill--

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:90%
but there's no drug in it.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just simple
starch or sugar.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
The person takes the
pill, and by association,

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
by conditioning, they start
to notice the pain going away.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So the first element of
the efficacy of placebos

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:90%
is based on conditioning.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And in this current model
of the way we view health,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
so much of health has to do with
taking something outside of you

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
to change your
state inside of you.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we've
all been conditioned

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:90%
into believing that's the case.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, certain color pills
work better than other pills.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
If you name a drug that sounds
really, really effective

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
or has a name you
can't pronounce,

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.530 align:middle line:84%
it will work better for
people, because they'll

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:90%
give their power to it.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
If you name a drug that
rhymes with what it does,

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
it will work more effectively
because it'll subconsciously

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
begin to cue certain
beliefs and conditions.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
If you charge more
for a drug, it

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
will work better, even if
you're giving the placebo.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And by the same
means, if the doctor

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is enthusiastic about
the placebo or the study,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:90%
it will work even better.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second element that
makes placebos effective

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:90%
is expectation.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So the person gets that pill,
and the doctor tells them,

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:90%
this is a new drug.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:90%
This drug is highly effective.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Think of that pill as a
symbol of possibility.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And when they grab that pill and
they're about ready to take it,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
before they take it, they
begin, in their mind,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to begin to believe
or accept, or begin

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
to think about that that could
possibly change their health.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, they
start getting optimistic.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
They start looking
forward to the change.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.030 align:middle line:84%
They start believing
that there could

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:90%
be a change in their health.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And when they're combining
that clear intention

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.340 align:middle line:84%
with the elevated emotion
of gratitude, or optimism,

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
or excitement, or
inspiration, in a sense,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
they're changing
their state of being.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And so if conditioning,
then, is based on the past,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
expectation is
based on the future.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's so
many great studies

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
on the power of expectation.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the nocebo is when
you're given an inert substance

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to experience
the side effects of that drug,

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
but you're not even
getting the drug.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, for the person
whose glass is half empty

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're given
a placebo, and they

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
begin to experience the side
effects of that placebo,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
thinking they're
getting the drug,

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's producing
those elements where

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
they start feeling bad, wow.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.600 align:middle line:84%
It must mean then they're
expecting some outcome

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
In one study that was done
with patients that were about

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.438 align:middle line:84%
ready to go into
chemotherapy, the doctors

00:06:59.438 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
told them that there
was a high probability

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
they would get nauseous
after they were administered

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.970 align:middle line:90%
the chemotherapy.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And 50% of those patients
got nauseous on the drive

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
over to their first
chemotherapy treatment.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.875 align:middle line:84%
Expectation means you
begin to expect an outcome.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
to expect an outcome,

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.440 align:middle line:84%
your body begins to
physiologically change

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:90%
in anticipation of that effect.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
The third thing that
makes a placebo effective

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
is what we call
assigning meaning

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:90%
based on learning information.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So if the doctor
shows up and says,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.520 align:middle line:84%
this drug is going to enhance
serotonin and the receptor

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
sites in your brain, and
they take out a chart

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and they show you
how serotonin is

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.387 align:middle line:84%
what begins to create
neurotransmission,

00:07:46.387 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course,
when they see the pill,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
they start to assign
meaning behind what it does,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and it increases the efficacy
of how the placebo works.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
three elements that

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
begin to change a
person's state of being.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So then that pill represents
a symbol of hope--

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:90%
a symbol of possibility.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And when a person begins
to associate that pill

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.140 align:middle line:84%
with the thought
of being better,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
they're selecting a new
future subconsciously.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not even aware
that they're doing that.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And if they begin to
combine that clear intention

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.750 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, they're

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:90%
changing their state of being.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they change
their state of being,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
they're changing the way they
think and feel, and in a sense,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
now, they're moving
their biology

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
from the past
present reality into

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:90%
the future present reality.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
In depression
studies where there

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:84%
is a placebo that's being
tested against the drug,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
the research shows that
four out of five people

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.080 align:middle line:84%
respond as well to
the placebo as they

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:90%
do to the drug for depression.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:10%
They've done brain
scans on people

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:10%
before they're given the
placebo or given the drug.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
They meet with the doctors.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.548 align:middle line:90%
They take the pill.

00:09:04.548 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Now the person doesn't
know whether they're

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
getting the real substance or
they're getting the placebo.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And after a period
of time, the person

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
notices that they
start to feel better.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
their brain scans

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.390 align:middle line:84%
after the end of the study,
you see a significant change

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in the way their
brain is functioning.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
That means that they are
making their own pharmacy

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
of anti-depressants
by thought alone.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The important point that
I want you to remember

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
is that every single day
that person took that pill,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
it was a reminder of moving
into a new state of being.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Every day they
took the pill, they

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
remembered what the
pill could do for them.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:90%
They start to get optimistic.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They start to look
forward to the outcome.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
They start to get inspired.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They start to feel grateful,
combining that clear intention

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.890 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated emotion,
changing their state of being,

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and they do that for
eight weeks in the study.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Now the question is, do
you need the sugar pill,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
the saline injection,
or some false surgery

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
to move into a new
state of being?

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you need some
external substance

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
to convince you to move
into a new state of being,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:84%
or can you move into a new state
of being just by thought alone?

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
The answer, of course, is
in the meditative process.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We teach people how to change
their state of being when they

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
get beyond their
analytical mind,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
where they can begin to program
their autonomic nervous system

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:84%
to make their own
pharmacy of chemicals.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:10%
Now take a look.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:10%
This is called the
quantitative EEG, or qEEG.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And what it does is
it measures the amount

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:10%
of energy in your brain at
different brainwave states.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
If you see a lot of
blue in the brain,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that means there's very
little energy in the brain.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.480 align:middle line:84%
When you see a lot
of red in the brain,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that means there's a lot
of energy in the brain.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
If you see green, green usually
represents normal or average.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:84%
If you see shades
of yellow or orange,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:84%
you're moving more
energy towards red.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:10%
If you see a light blue
and a mid-range blue,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.930 align:middle line:10%
you're moving closer to
a low amount of energy.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:10%
And then this area right
here, between 1 and 4 Hertz,

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.500 align:middle line:10%
represents delta.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:10%
This area right here between 4
and 8 Hertz represents theta.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.570 align:middle line:10%
This is alpha here.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:10%
This is low-range beta,
this is mid-range beta,

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:10%
and this is high-range beta.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So we can determine
the amount of energy

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
in the brain in different
brainwave states.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is our
first case history.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the bottom
left-hand side there,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a lot of
blue in the brain.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
In mid-range beta,
that represents

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:84%
a person who has very little
energy in their brain.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:84%
This person had a very
significant amount

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:90%
of depression.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Four days later, we
scan the brain again.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Remember, green is normal.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You see a significant
change in mid-range beta.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:90%
This is high beta up here.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:90%
See all that blue in the brain?

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at three days later.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
You see all that green?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
It represents they changed
their brain by thought alone.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
not just in their mind.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It's in their brain.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Here's a second case study.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Same exact pattern.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:10%
A lot of blue in mid-range beta.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
That represents, again,
another person with depression.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at the
post measurement

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:90%
on the right-hand side.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:90%
You see all that green?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:90%
That represents normal.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is high beta.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Look at all that
blue in the brain.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Person has no energy
in their brain.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Three days later, after
doing meditation twice a day,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:90%
take a look at that change.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
All that green represents they
changed their brain by thought

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
alone--

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
by moving into a
new state of being.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
They didn't need an
external substance to do it.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:90%
They did it by thought alone.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's been
numerous pain studies that

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
also have caught my attention--
dental studies where people

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
were given a placebo
and were told

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that they were given a very
strong narcotic for pain.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And almost 50% of the people
that were given the placebo

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
had absolutely no pain
during the procedure.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they did was
they found a substance that

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:90%
would block morphine receptors.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is when
they injected this substance,

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
all of the person's
pain came back,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
which means, then, that person
was making their own pharmacy

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:84%
of morphine-- their own
pharmacy of anti-pain chemicals

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
by thought alone.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a Parkinson's study
that I found very fascinating.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's disease
is a deficiency

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.367 align:middle line:90%
in dopamine in the brain.

00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And when there's not enough
dopamine in the brain,

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.850 align:middle line:84%
the upper motor neurons
can't communicate well

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and it
causes involuntary tremors

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
or spastic paralysis
in the body.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So in the placebo study,
they told the subjects

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that the placebo was a
very strong drug that

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
would heal Parkinson's
disease and their symptoms.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:84%
When they got the substance
administered to them,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
more than 50% of the people
with the Parkinson's disease--

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:90%
all of their symptoms went away.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And one researcher said,
well, if they no longer

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:44.130 align:middle line:84%
have any tremors, is
it possible, then,

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that their body's making their
own pharmacy of dopamine?

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So now they did
this little study

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
where they injected
a radioactive dye

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
into their bloodstream that
competes for the receptor

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:90%
sites for dopamine.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Now think about receptor
sites in your brain

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:90%
like parking spaces.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So if the person that
was given the placebo

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
was making their own
dopamine, dopamine

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
would get into the
parking spaces first,

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and when they injected
this radioactive dye,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
there would be no parking
spaces for the dye.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So when they imaged
the brain, they

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't see any radioactive
elements in any of the areas

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:90%
where dopamine is absorbed.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't
make their own dopamine

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
when they injected
the radioactive dye,

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
then dopamine would not
be in the parking spaces

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and the radioactive dye would
get into the parking spaces,

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and we would know then
that they were not

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:90%
making their own dopamine.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
What they found was
that these people

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
were making 200 times the amount
of dopamine by thought alone.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
caveat to this story,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:84%
because when those people
returned back into their lives

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and they sat in the same
chair, they played chess

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
with their friends, they
saw the same people,

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
they went to the same places,
they did the same things,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
all of their
conditions returned.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And in other words, when they
returned back to their life,

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:84%
it was their
external environment

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that was controlling the
way they were feeling

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.750 align:middle line:90%
and the way they were thinking.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, they went
back to the old self.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the environment
is that strong

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
that it influences a person's
feelings and thoughts,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
their state of being to
return back to the old self,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
would it be a good
idea every single day

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:84%
to do a meditation to
change your state of being

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than
your environment?

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And if in the
depression studies,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.360 align:middle line:84%
it took eight weeks
for many people

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:84%
to change their state of
being by thought alone that

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
ultimately healed
their depression,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
do you think it would be a good
idea for you, every single day,

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
to change your state of being
for eight weeks before you

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:90%
start seeing changes?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
to understand this,

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:84%
because some people do
it once or do it twice,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and they expect the
change to take place

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:90%
in just one or two attempts.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And why does that not work?

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Because either the
person's getting up

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
after their meditation
feeling the same way

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:90%
they did as they started--

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and if you get up from
your meditation feeling

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the same way, then in a
sense nothing happened

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.020 align:middle line:84%
neurologically, nothing happened
neurochemically, nothing

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
happened hormonally, nothing
happened genetically,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:90%
nothing happened energetically.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.960 align:middle line:90%
You're still the same person.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.140 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is
is that some people

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
move into a new state of being.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
They feel great, and then
they open their eyes,

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and they get back
into their life,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and they return back to
their old self again.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.810 align:middle line:84%
That's like eating a great
breakfast-- organic meal--

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and then spending the rest
of your day eating junk food.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So the importance behind
placebo is that it

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:90%
may take a few attempts.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It may take some time--

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
every single day changing
your state of being

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to be greater than
your environment.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.825 align:middle line:84%
It may take you a little
time to change your biology.

00:18:00.825 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So how can you then move
into a new state of being

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and change your body
by thought alone?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, think about this.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:84%
How is it that the preacher in
the deep south of the United

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
States can move into a
state of religious ecstasy

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and drink strychnine or poison
and have no biological effects?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Or the snake charmer moving
into an altered state of mind,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:84%
gets bit by a poisonous
snake, and never has

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.630 align:middle line:90%
any blood coagulation.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Or the tribes of
the South Pacific

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:84%
move into a state of trance and
walk across a bed of hot coals

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and never burn their feet.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
In each one of these
cases, every individual

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
made a decision with
such firm intention

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that the amplitude
of that energy

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
caused their body to
respond to a new mind--

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that the choice that
they made in that moment

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
changed their biology
in that second.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And in that instant, they
were immune to the conditions

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:90%
in their environment.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense,
then, it was energy

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that began to
affect their biology

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and changed their
state of being.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Now in order for you to
change some health condition

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
or condition in
your life, you're

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
going to have to make a decision
with such firm intention

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:84%
that the energy
from that decision

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
is greater than the hardwired
programs in your brain

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
conditioning in your body,

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and your body literally has
to respond to a new mind--

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:84%
that the choice that
you make in that moment

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
becomes a memory
or an experience

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.220 align:middle line:90%
that you never forget.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger the
emotion that you feel,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
the more you will pay
attention to the decision.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, then, you
are moving your body out

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:90%
of the past into the future.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do most people
make a decision to change?

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:90%
They're sitting on the couch.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They have their
computer over here.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They have their smart
phone over here.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They have the big
screen TV over here.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And they say, let me see.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll change tomorrow.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, the body's
realizing it's not

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:90%
getting any new information.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, it knows
you're not serious.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It knows that you haven't
changed your state of being.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.532 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, nothing's
going to change.

00:20:27.532 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But think about a
time in your life

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
where you painted
yourself into a corner

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and you had no other
choice but to change.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:90%
And you said, this is it.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't care how I feel, body.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what's going on in
my life or what people think,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.050 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't care how long
it's going to take time.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you make
that kind of decision,

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and the hair on the back
of your neck stands up,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that's a new signal that's
making it to the body.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, the
body's literally

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
getting new information
and now the body

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:90%
is responding to a new mind.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of
energetic signal

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that the body gets that
begins to select and instruct

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
new genes.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And remember, genes
make proteins,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and proteins are responsible
for the structure

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:90%
and the function of your body.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And the expression
of proteins, then,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:90%
is the expression of life.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So then in order for you to
literally move your body out

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
of the past into
the present, you're

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
change your energy.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you from
doing this for so many years,

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I now know that nobody changes
until they change their energy.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And when they change their
energy, they change their life.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So then how, then,
do we get thought

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to begin to influence our body?

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Really simple.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
You will only accept,
believe, and surrender

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to the thoughts equal
to your emotional state,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and you will not
accept, believe,

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to any
thoughts that are not

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:90%
equal to your emotional state.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:90%
A person gets a diagnosis.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:90%
The diagnosis is cancer.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The diagnosis is
rheumatoid arthritis.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The diagnosis is
multiple sclerosis.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
The moment that person
gets the diagnosis--

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the moment they get the news
and how the doctor delivers it--

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.420 align:middle line:84%
you can agree with me they have
some type of internal change.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:84%
They are feeling an
emotion like fear.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.220 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling
emotion like pain.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling an
emotion like suffering.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that change
in their internal state.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They remember that moment
the doctor told them.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The brain takes a
snapshot, and that

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:90%
becomes a long-term memory.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:10%
And now, the person
can say all they want--

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to beat
this condition--

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:10%
but if they're still
living by that emotion,

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.970 align:middle line:10%
and they're saying, I'm
getting stronger every day,

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:10%
I'm getting stronger every day,
and the body's feeling fear,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:10%
the body's feeling sadness
or pain, the body's feeling

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:10%
discouraged, that thought will
never make it to the body--

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:10%
never past the brain stem.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And they can say that
affirmation over and over

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So then it makes sense,
then, that if you

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
begin to change your
emotional state,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and instead of
surrendering to fear,

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
start surrendering to
love or gratitude--

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.180 align:middle line:84%
and think about the emotional
signature of gratitude.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Something is happening to you
or you are receiving something.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So this signature, emotionally,
is the perfect state

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:90%
of receiving.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So if a person is feeling fear,
they cannot accept, believe,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to any thought
that's not consistent with

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:90%
the feeling of fear.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.860 align:middle line:90%
It never makes it to their body.

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Change their state
from fear to gratitude

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and have that person
open their heart,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and in spite of the news, begin
to change their internal state.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:84%
If they're in a
state of gratitude

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're in a
state of receiving,

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:84%
they will accept,
believe, and surrender

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to the thoughts equal
to that emotional state,

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and they'll begin to program
the autonomic nervous system

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.640 align:middle line:90%
into a whole new destiny.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Here's an example.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We had a woman come to one of
our follow-ups for the weekend.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And she was scheduled
for surgery.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And she had a car accident.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And she could never get away
from the debilitating pain.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And pain created the emotions of
frustration, of anger, sadness.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Felt really, really limited and
victimized by her condition.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And so she scheduled the
surgery for the Thursday

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:90%
after the event.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this event,
she had to understand

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that she had to trade those
emotions for gratitude.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And by opening her
heart and really

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
feeling gratitude in spite of
her past, in spite of her pain,

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in spite of what would
be potentially happening

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.710 align:middle line:84%
in her future, she literally
got in the present moment

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:90%
and opened her heart.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The moment she started
doing that, she started

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to notice a big
change in the way she

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.640 align:middle line:90%
was processing information.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, she felt
a significant change

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.010 align:middle line:84%
in the heat running
down her spine.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And by the time that
meditation was over,

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
she had absolutely
no pain in her body.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way she
came to that event

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:84%
was she couldn't even
sit up in the chair,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
she was having such
extreme spasms.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But by the time she
changed her emotional state

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and moved into a
new state of being,

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
it was the right
formula that began

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to program her autonomic
nervous system to begin

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:90%
to do the healing for her.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.300 align:middle line:84%
If you ask her who did the
healing, she'll tell you,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.672 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't me that did it.

00:25:50.672 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It was some intelligence
that's greater than me

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:90%
that did the healing for me.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:90%
I just got out of the way.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And she moved from
one state of being

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
into another state of being.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And just like those placebo
studies, all of a sudden,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms began to
change and her body

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
began to respond to a new mind.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Now that I've shown
you the placebo effect

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and how it works, how will
you use this knowledge

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:90%
to change your body?

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that your mind can

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:84%
begin to produce similar
effects in your life

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:90%
as well as your body?

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:84%
In order for us to
answer that question,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.560 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to learn
about how the mind and how

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:90%
matter are intimately related.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we're
going to explore the wacky world

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.840 align:middle line:90%
of quantum physics.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand that
every thought produces

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:84%
a frequency and that
energy begins the condition

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:90%
in objectifed space.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that you can
create the life of your dreams?

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Dr. Joe
Dispenza for Rewired,

the next episode, where

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:84%
we go beyond the ordinary
