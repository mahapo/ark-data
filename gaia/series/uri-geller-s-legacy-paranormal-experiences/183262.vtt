00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
My introduction into
the CIA, or to the CIA,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.130 align:middle line:10%
was an interesting process.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:10%
And I have to go
back in time for you

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:10%
to understand what made the
CIA interested in my powers.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It started with the Mossad.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I started performing
in Israel in 1960--

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.250 align:middle line:90%
end of '68, 1969.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced to
generals who actually

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
came to see my shows and house
parties and private parties

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And everyone was amazed.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was approached
by a general.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me what else
can I do with my mind.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a segment of my life
that I cannot really talk

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that
I worked for Mossad.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
The information I used to bring
back to Israel's secret agency

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
was so precise that they
wanted to know how I do it.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:90%
How does a human mind--

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
how does it create a
possibility, a doorway,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
for me to be able to bring
information that otherwise they

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
couldn't?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
The Mossad decided that they
don't have the ability--

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
the computers, the electrodes,
the scientific departments

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
to study Uri Geller.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
So they pick up the
phone and call up

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the CIA because the CIA and
Mossad were working together

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:90%
for many, many decades.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:90%
And I guess they still do.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So they asked the CIA
whether they would test me?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
CIA jumped on the idea

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because they were very
concerned-- the CIA were

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:84%
concerned that the
Russians were ahead

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:90%
of them in psychical research.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, the CIA already got
information about me.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And they make a deal that the
Mossad lets me go, releases me.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And I leave in 1972, straight
to Palo Alto, California,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to Stanford Research Institute.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's where Hal
Puthoff and Russell Targ

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:10%
and Edgar Mitchell and
all those scientists

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.740 align:middle line:10%
who had very direct
links to the CIA,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:10%
they set up their
experiments with me.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:90%
So that was the beginning.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%

under laboratory controlled

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Actually, one of the scientists,
Russell Targ, was a magician.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:90%
So he knew trickery and so on.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They built a Faraday cage,
or maybe they already

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:90%
had a Faraday cage at Stanford.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in this Faraday
cage, in this shielded room.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And drawings were
done outside the room

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
or in houses of
the experimenters.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was not allowed
to touch them.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had to sit in that
room with a marker and paper

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and duplicate the drawings
that were inside the sealed

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:90%
envelopes.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was 100% correct
almost all the time.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Some drawings were
milimetrically the same size.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I explained it that I was so
precise because I had time.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
On a stage, not under laboratory
controlled conditions,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:90%
in a show, I don't have time.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I can invest two minutes
or 2 and 1/2 minutes

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:90%
into a telepathical routine.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But there, trying
to receive a drawing

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
with extra sensory perception,
I could sit for half an hour.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the most complicated
one was a bunch of grapes.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:90%
They drew it's 24 grapes.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I got 24 grapes.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.190 align:middle line:84%
If you measure the same--
the size of the grape,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:90%
it's the same size.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Really incredible.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Then they have very different
drawings like the devil,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
which, strangely enough,
call it religiouswise,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
mentally, I couldn't
get the devil.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
What I did get are the 10
commandments, Planet Earth,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and a trident that
the devil was holding.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm mystified by that.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
There was another drawing which
wasn't done by human beings.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:84%
A computer, which probably was
in the basement of Stanford

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Research Institute, drew--

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.717 align:middle line:84%
picked out the word out of
a dictionary, I believe.

00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
That's to the best
of my recollection.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And it drew a kite with a tail.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And I got it.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:90%
I got the kite.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:90%
And they were amazed.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, while these
experiments were going on,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I managed to affect
the computers

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:90%
in the basement of Stanford.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
The rumor is that I
erased computer tapes.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the CIA say, what?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
He can erase computer
tapes with his mind?

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I did experiments
with floppy disk,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.428 align:middle line:84%
where I put my hand
over the floppy disks--

00:06:40.428 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because they were
floppy disks then--

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and I would erase
the information.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This was vital for the
CIA because, later on, I

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
did erase computer tapes that
KGB agents were taking out

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:84%
of Mexico City with
secret information.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:10%
But one very
well-recorded instant

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:10%
that happened inside Stanford
Research Institute in Palo

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:10%
Alto, California
where scientists

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:10%
put a weight on an
electronic scale under a bell

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:10%
jar so nobody can say that
I blew on it or I moved it

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:10%
and under charts that
measure movements precisely.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.440 align:middle line:90%
I made that weight lose--

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:90%
that weight lose weight.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:90%
It levitated probably.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's all under
controlled conditions.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And then, this is amazing.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.210 align:middle line:84%
We took a break from
one of the experiments.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was Hal
Puthoff, who was a physicist,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and Russell Targ, who took
me to the canteen of Stanford

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was eating ice cream.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I put a scoop of
ice cream into my mouth.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I feel something
metallic in the ice cream.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So I spit it out onto the table.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Mitchell, the
astronaut, picks it up.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And he says, this looks
very familiar to me.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
It was an arrowhead, a
broken off arrowhead.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
As we walk in the corridor of
Stanford Research Institute,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
we all hear a clang on
the wall-- bap, bap, bap.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
And on the floor
falls the second half

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
of that object that I
found in the ice cream.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.150 align:middle line:90%
And Ed picks it up.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:90%
You know, Ed walked on the Moon.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
He puts it together,
and he says, oh, my god,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
this is my tie pin.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I lost it years ago
on a beach in Florida.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:90%
A genuine dematerialization.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is another double blind
experiment in which a die is

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
placed in a metal box, both box
and die being provided by SRI.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The box is shaken up with
neither the experimenter

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
nor Geller knowing where the
die is or which face is up.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a live
experiment that you see.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.765 align:middle line:84%
Geller guessed that
a four was showing.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.260 align:middle line:84%
You will note that
he was correct,

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and he was quite pleased
to have guessed correctly.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We decided at the outset
to carry out the die and box

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
experiment until we got
to a million to 1 odds,

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
at which time the
experiment was terminated.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:10%
Out of 10 tries in which
he passed twice and guessed

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:10%
eight times, the eight
guesses were correct.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:10%
And that gave us a probability
of about 1 in a million.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:10%
We would point out again,
there were no errors

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:10%
in the times he made a guess.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:10%
>> One scientist they called
Kit Green, who was, I think,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:10%
the head of the scientific
department of the CIA

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:10%
in Langley, Virginia--

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.770 align:middle line:10%
Puthoff told Kit Green that
I can see things from afar.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And Kit Green's reaction
was, no, he can't.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And Hal told him, yes, he can.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And Kit Green says, well,
where is Uri Geller?

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And Hal Puthoff says,
Uri is right here.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, you must understand.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:84%
This is way before Skype and
FaceTime and mobile phones.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:84%
This is all, you know, the
old-fashioned black telephones.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And Kit Green says,
well, OK, Uri--

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I got on the line
with Kit Green.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
By the way, while
all this is going on,

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know
that this is CIA stuff.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I think this is some
colleague, scientific colleague

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:90%
in the Washington area.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:10%
>> And I picked up a book, which
is the same book that I had

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:10%
on my desk at the time
of this phone call many,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:10%
many years ago.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
This book is a collection
of medical illustrations

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had it on my desk
at the headquarters

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
building because I was using
it for part of my work.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And I opened it up to a page,
and I just stared at it.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm seeing
something kind of strange.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
>> And I say, well--

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I starts drawing things,
and I throw them--

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
I crumpled them up,
throw them in dustbin

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
until finally I get a
drawing which looked

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:90%
to me like scrambled eggs.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But very, very strongly, I
had the word "architectural"

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
come into my mind,
"architectural"

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:90%
or "architecture."

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So I write it on my drawing
above these scrambled eggs

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:84%
that I drew, the
word "architecture."

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So I deliver the drawing
out of the Faraday cage or--

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember where I did it.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that I was
on the phone with someone

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
in the Washington
area, with a scientist.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I later got a
copy of that drawing.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.890 align:middle line:10%
And I was astonished to
find what he had drawn.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it does look
like scrambled eggs.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was a section
of the human brain,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:84%
a sagittal section from the
side of the human brain.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
caught my attention

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
was, he had written
across the top of his

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
drawing the word
"architecture," "architecture."

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
I had written in my
handwriting the word

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.390 align:middle line:84%
"architecture," a
viral infection.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
biological warfare

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:84%
effect on the nervous
system of a threat virus.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:10%
And I'd written my
notes, oh, "architecture

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:10%
of a viral infection."

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And I got it.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And that, I believe,
convinced Kit Green,

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:17.030 align:middle line:84%
there's definitely something
here that has to be studied.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot
of money was released

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:84%
to study paranormal
research, psychic research,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and to set up remote
viewing research.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
One experiment-- and I
want to make it very clear

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not going to name
the intelligence service that

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:90%
asked me to do this.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:90%
They took me to a laboratory.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.122 align:middle line:90%
It was white walled.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of this room
stood a living pig, a huge pig.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists, two
of them, looked at me

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and said, OK, we're going
to go out for coffee.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
By the time we come back,
we want the pig dead.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.680 align:middle line:90%
We want you to stop its heart.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I was shattered, shocked.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love animals.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
points of me breaking away

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:90%
from science.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
That was so important for me
to say because I would never--

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I never accepted dark missions.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I never accepted black missions.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you put 2 and
2 together, maybe they

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.940 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to stop the
heart of Andropov,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:90%
who was the head of the KGB.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see if the
human mind could stop a heart?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:90%
And why pick a pig?

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
Because a pig has a very
similar heart to a human being.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Some missions, or most missions
I can't even talk about

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.270 align:middle line:90%
because this wasn't--

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
CIA wasn't the only
secret intelligence.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.255 align:middle line:90%
There was MI5, MI6.

00:15:14.255 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, believe it or
not, they wanted

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.867 align:middle line:84%
to see if my mind can
trigger a nuclear weapon.

00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:10%
So they took me to the Lawrence
Livermore radiation labs,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:10%
where they build atomic bombs.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:10%
I can't even start describing
you what happened in there.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:10%
This falls into
the category of--

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:10%
think about the most
incredible science fiction film

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:10%
that you've ever seen.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.668 align:middle line:84%
That's what's happened in that
secret installation of Lawrence

00:15:53.668 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Livermore radiation labs.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Scientists began to hallucinate.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
They saw birds flying,
people with no arms.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Washington was so concerned.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
CIA were so concerned
about those scientists

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
at the Lawrence
Livermore radiation labs

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:90%
that they flew people out.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
The things that were going
on at the Lawrence Livermore

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:84%
radiation labs when I tried
to trigger a nuclear bomb

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.000 align:middle line:90%
were amazing.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
While my tests were
going on, the word

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
leaked out to the
media in America.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
When I'm saying the
media, there was

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
a tabloid called the "Tatler,"
and which had a headline--

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:90%
"He Bends Metal for Scientists."

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I still have these papers.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
"The National Enquirer,"
"Odds of 1 billion

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to 1, Uri Geller being tested
at Stanford Research Institute."

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:90%
The media was writing about it.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Parallel to that, magicians
who were attacking psychics,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
they said psychics
are charlatans.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:90%
They're frauds.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:90%
They're just magicians.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're hoodwinking
people and so on.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So controversy
began to flourish.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:90%
But for the CIA, it was great.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:90%
It was good.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
Because in my opinion,
parallel to the CIA test,

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:84%
the American department's
psychological warfare offices

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:90%
were involved too.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:90%
So controversy was good.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
From one side, it was debunked
so the Russians were mixed up.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Are they testing magicians?

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Or are they testing real people
with supernatural powers?

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So the CIA took advantage
of the controversy,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of the skeptics trying
to debunk not only me.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:10%
But there were other
psychics involved--

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:10%
Pat Price.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:10%
There was another guy
called Ingo Swann.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So it was very,
very interesting.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But I know that what I've
done for the CIA is real.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Because then they asked
me to do things for them.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So then they sent
me out on missions.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.220 align:middle line:10%
I was in instilled into Mexico.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:10%
I was brought into the
Mexican White House

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.570 align:middle line:10%
to meet the president.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:10%
I had certain tasks that
I cannot talk about.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:84%
I was even asked
to feel psychically

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:84%
whether Lee Harvey Oswald, who
assassinated President Kennedy,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
visited the Russian
embassy in Mexico City.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Because the Russian
embassy, at that time,

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
was the largest espionage
listening center

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:90%
for Latin America, for the KGB.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.640 align:middle line:90%
And I was asked to do--

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I had a handler in Mexico City.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And I did lots of
stuff for the CIA.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it kind of rumbled
on, the controversy.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:90%
My show business was mixed up.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So for me, controversy
was amazing

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:84%
because the skeptics were
making me more famous.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:90%
They were making me more--

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.720 align:middle line:90%
they added mysticism around me.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, Oscar
Wilde, 100 years ago,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.360 align:middle line:84%
said, "there is only
one worse thing in life

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.460 align:middle line:90%
than being talked about.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
being talked about."

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So the skeptics were fueling the
wheel of publicity around me.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was a cover for me
to continue this secret stuff.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Because if the whole world
knew that I'm really real,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't be around today.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be
talking to you now.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's one point.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Then it got into--

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:84%
American officers took
me to the White House.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:10%
They wanted me to
convince President Carter.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:10%
Then Senator Claiborne
Pell got involved,

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.800 align:middle line:10%
who was then the head of the
American Foreign Relations

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:10%
Committee.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:90%
So I've done things for them.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the missions
I was asked to do,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
which came to
light because there

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
was a Pentagon photographer
there who took pictures--

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I was briefed in
London to convince

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.570 align:middle line:84%
the Russians to sign the
nuclear arms reduction treaty.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Max Kampelman flew to
London secretly and met me

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.180 align:middle line:90%
in a secret location.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So he briefed me.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:90%
They flew me to Geneva.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I got very close
to Yuli Vorontsov,

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
the head of the Russian--

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:90%
nuclear negotiator.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And telepathically,
I bombarded him--

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:90%
sign, sign, sign.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And they signed.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I can't
take full credit

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that I did it totally
because it happened,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:90%
totally because of me.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's no doubt
that, telepathically, I

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:90%
was influential.

the capsule of phenomena that
happened in many installations

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that I visited,
including Europe--

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
when I was on TV, the radar
systems were knocked out.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not saying this.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Other people said that
when the raid of Entebbe

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
happened, when we flew in planes
there to take out the hostages,

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:84%
all the radar systems
were knocked out.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The significance of that
is that Israeli planes

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:57.220 align:middle line:84%
could fly into
Entebbe to release

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
the hostages without being
detected on radar systems.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:90%

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:90%
forget the word "psychics."

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:90%
Use the word "intuitives."

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Intuitives are
being employed today

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:84%
by secret services
around the world.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt in my
mind that even today, today,

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and in the future, there will
always be the human factor.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
There will always be those
who can bring in information

and they fly drones, and bombs,
and they spy through joysticks.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.990 align:middle line:90%
And this joystick is the mind.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:84%
They have people who
sit by computers.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And they can tell you
movements of submarines,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Russian submarines, trains
with nuclear weapons on them

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%

the Russians to sign the

It stops me from doing things
that it doesn't want me to do.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:90%
That is my explanation--

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:90%
very, very elementary.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:90%
But it guides me.

And then when
things are no-no, it

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%

with other people.

conclude this segment,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that there is definitely--
this is my opinion,

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and no one will sway way
away from my belief system,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:84%
that there is indeed something
outside me that guides me,

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.180 align:middle line:90%
controls me, but lets me--

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.465 align:middle line:84%
allows me to do things
that I want to do.

00:29:19.465 --> 00:29:20.965 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
the final example.

00:29:20.965 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:90%
I am inside a bottle.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
The bottle is floating
down the stream of a river.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Inside the bottle, I can
do whatever I want to.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:84%
But I cannot stop the
bottle flowing downstream.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:90%
