00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
it scientifically.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Albert Einstein in 1924--

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.890 align:middle line:90%
I've spoken about this--

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
comes up with this amazing
scientific equation,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
E equals MC squared, where
Albert Einstein proves

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:84%
to the world scientifically that
everything is made from energy.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Even this chair is energy.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It's vibrating at
a certain frequency

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:90%
that, to us, feels solid.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But he also proves that
energy cannot be destroyed.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So if Albert Einstein proves
scientifically that energy

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
cannot be destroyed, the
question must be asked, OK,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:90%
we are energy.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.760 align:middle line:90%
So what happens when we die?

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:90%
So you can't kill the energy.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our spirit?

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our soul?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our mind energy?

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And I very simply
believe that when we die,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
our energy, our
spirit, our soul leaves

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
our body, like the
tens of thousands

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of stories you have
from millions of people

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
around the world, that
they left their body.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:90%
They weren't ready to die.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And they came back to the body.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And they went through the tunnel
of light, and with the music.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
about to enter

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that other side,
the realm, heaven,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:90%
paradise, call it whatever.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were drawn
back into their body.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of stories
of spirits communicating

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:84%
with their loved ones,
dogs, cats, animals, humans,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, come on.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a fact that people
accept that ghosts do exist.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So scientifically,
the scientific theory

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:90%
is very simple.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.890 align:middle line:90%
We leave our body.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And we go to a
different dimension.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:90%
I want to call it heaven.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that I will
meet all my family there,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
all my dogs.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm a great dog lover.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:90%
So I had all my life dogs.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And I know we will meet someday.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a huge believer
in life after death.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
My mother died in
Sonning on Thames

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
in our house in this small,
tiny, little English village

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.870 align:middle line:90%
outside London.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And she was buried in
a Christian cemetery.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.775 align:middle line:84%
But because we're Jewish, the
grave has a star of David on.

00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But in order to get the
tombstone I spoke to my rabbi.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And he directed me
to a stone maker,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:90%
somebody who carves tombstones.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to him
over the phone.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Please tell me now
how much it will cost.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:90%
A tombstone for my mother.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, OK,
I'll come and show you

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:90%
a few pieces of marble.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And you choose which
tombstone you would like.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
So he says, I'll come
to you on a Sunday.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, my house has 38 CCTV
cameras running all the time.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I can see them all
around the world.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in the kitchen and I see
his car-- it's a little van--

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
coming up to the big, main
gate of my house on the court.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And he stops by the gate.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And the gate is iron.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:90%
So you can see through it.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And I see that there's a dog
sitting next to the driver,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:90%
next to him.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And I say, aw, I'm
definitely going

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to go with him, because if
he travels with his dog,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:90%
he's a dog lover like me.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But instead of opening
the gate automatically,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:90%
I go out to him foot wise.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And as I approached the car,
I see him and I see the dog.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I open the
side gate, and I go

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:90%
towards the car to pat the dog.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And I look into the cabin.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And the dog is not there.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
He is only there, sitting
by the steering wheel.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So he rolls down the window
and I say, where is your dog?

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I tried to look
back into the van.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Because I was sure the dog.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:90%
And he ashened.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I get goosebumps now.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Because he says to
me, what did you say?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, there was
a dog sitting here.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Uri Geller,
my dog died a year ago.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But I always carried
him on this seat.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
He was traveling
everywhere with me.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I really get chills
now, if you can see.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Come close up on my-- my
hair is standing on end.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:90%
So I was so excited.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I ran back into the house,
and I told my wife, Hanna,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:90%
I just saw a ghost, a dog.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:90%

I am in New York.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I live on 57th Street
and 1st Avenue.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:90%
I had an apartment there.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was the birthday
of a doctor we knew.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to buy him a
binocular in Bloomingdale's.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:90%
I go to Bloomingdale's.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I buy the binocular.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And then before I get
back to 57th Street,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I decide to go up and visit our
very close friend, Maria Janice

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Cooper and Byron Janice.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:90%
And I go up to their apartment.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
We talk a little.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, I'm
going home now.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Binocular in my hand.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Package up.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:90%
And I get to 57th Street.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And I can see from afar,
the canopy of our building.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:84%
In New York you have
canopies protruding out

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.410 align:middle line:90%
of the building for rainy days.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I look at the
canopy, I suddenly

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:84%
feel that my feet are not
touching the pavement anymore.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:90%
There was something missing.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.970 align:middle line:90%
I was like walking in the air.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%
And I looked down.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what
to think because I

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:90%
wasn't on the pavement.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I can remember

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
that I'm being hurled
towards a mesh screen.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I didn't recognize where
I was being thrown into.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But my instinct was
to protect my head.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:10%
And I'm crashing
through a mesh screen.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:10%
You know, those to keep
out flies in summer.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And there's a big round table.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:90%
And I fall on the table.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:90%
There is glass on the table.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.360 align:middle line:90%
So it slips from under my hands.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It breaks.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of noise.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And I crash onto the floor.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking around.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:90%
And I recognize the room.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I am in the porch,
in the summer porch

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Andre Puharich's
house in Ossining, New York,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
36 miles out of New York.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of
stunned from the fall.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:84%
More from the fall than from
the transition from 57th Street

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And I start shouting,
Andre, Andre!

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a few minutes
for Andre to find me.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And he says, what
are you doing here?

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at the screen
that I came in from.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's torn inwards.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.086 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And I say to him, I
just left Maria's.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
He knew Maria, my
friendship with Maria.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:90%
And he picks up the phone.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And he says, Maria, Uri is here.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
hear, but he later

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
told me that there was silence.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And Maria then says to him,
what do you mean Uri is here?

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
He just left our apartment
on 521 Park Avenue.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The way I explain this
phenomenon to myself,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
whether I use the words a
multi-dimensional shift,

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:84%
or a quantum mechanical,
quantum entanglement

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon, a
bizarre dark loophole

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
in our existence that can
shift you, and materialize

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:84%
you, and dematerialize you
from one place to another,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't really know.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:90%
How can I know?

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
But it happened for a reason.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
You see, I am a huge
believer in Carl Jung's word

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that he coined
up, synchronicity.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything that happens in the
universe happens for a reason.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:90%
There's no coincidence.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, there might be.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But the overall bigger
picture in things

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that happen to you in your
life, or to other people that

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:84%
bring you together
are synchronicities.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So you see, Einstein, to me,
and his scientific theories

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and equations, proven
scientific equations,

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
were massively important
to balance my belief

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
system that these things are not
only ether and exist out there,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
but you can derive
them, extract them out

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of his scientific formulas, and
prove to the ordinary person

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that their ideas about
life after death,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, and ghosts
actually really do exist.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Because Einstein backed
it up with hard science.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why Einstein
was so brilliant.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:10%
And, by the way, in my
museum where we are actually

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:10%
sitting now, which will
open a year from now,

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:10%
David Bohm, who was
Albert Einstein's friend,

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:10%
gave me Einstein's pipe.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.042 align:middle line:84%
And I also managed
to get a letter

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that Albert Einstein wrote
David Bohm, telling him not

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:84%
to go to Israel because
Israel wasn't intellectually

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:90%
ready for him.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But David Bohm didn't listen
to Einstein, did come here,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
was a lecture at the
Technion in Haifa,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
fell in love with a
girl, married her,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and went to England.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's where he tested me.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So nothing will dent
my belief in God.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want to bring
the word religion into it.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Because religion, of
course, could be dark.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It could be positive.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.455 align:middle line:90%
It could be light.

00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It could be destruction.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.677 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, today, in some
parts around the world

00:13:54.677 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
people are fighting in
the name of religion.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
People are killing people
in the name of religion.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So for me, overall god,
again, means the creator

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:90%
of everything and anything.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:90%
And God is infinite.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
But I think through
evolution, through our journey

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:84%
through space and time, through
the universe's and cosmoses,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and beyond, we are proceeding
towards the creator.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I will take you
a few steps further.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
What I found intuitively--

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I doused this place here, and
I found an old ancient soap

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
factory, which is right there,
where they manufactured soap

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:90%
from olive oil.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Because hundreds of
years ago Muslims

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
did not buy soap from
Europe, because it

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:90%
was made from pig oil.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
first soap factories made

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:90%
from soap, made from olive oil.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:90%
And I know my dowsing abilities.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel maybe
as a remote viewer

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that the magnetic
pull to the center

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.670 align:middle line:84%
of this point on
this planet could

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
be a craft that is
buried somewhere

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:90%
in the vicinity of Jerusalem.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
I know I sound so
fantastically out there.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But it is a possibility that
a craft landed here eons ago,

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And there is some type of
a powerful cosmic energy

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:57.630 align:middle line:90%
emanating out of this craft.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
This is something I
actually remote viewed.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I cannot tell you for whom.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:10%
What I can say is
that if you read

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:10%
the Bible, the Ark
of the Covenant

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:10%
with the Ten Commandments, it
is said that the Ark itself,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:10%
the wings on the Ark had powers.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:90%
It had energy.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It could emit almost
like a laser beam force.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And it would cut through
stone like the stone

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:90%
was made from butter.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe that I
will find that Ark.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I am hoping that the 10
commandments are in the Ark.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seriously speaking to
archaeologists who actually

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:90%
asked me to look for it.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:10%
If you do read
biblical scriptures,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:10%
those scriptures are
riddled with miracles,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:10%
phenomena that came upon
individuals, whether it

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:10%
was rays of light, or
the sea opening up.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
do believe that we

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
are governed by some
extraterrestrial source,

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials or aliens
visited our planet, that they

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:90%
actually created those miracles.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's really down to what
you interpret it yourself.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:84%
My interpretation would not
agree with someone else.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Or their theories,
I will not agree to.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:90%
But I have my very own theories.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I want to believe that
part of the holy scriptures

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the creator,
with God, with something

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:90%
above us.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.485 align:middle line:84%
And some are connected to
an extraterrestrial source.

00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:84%
What I can share with you
and with all our viewers

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
here are the metallic
voices that a lot of people

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.380 align:middle line:90%
hear worldwide.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:84%
There are also a
lot of people who

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:84%
claim that there is a
certain buzz in their ears.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
about tinnitus now.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about high
frequency ELF waves, Extra Low

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Frequency waves.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a universal humming.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
some kind maybe

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
language that is

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:90%
trying to communicate with us.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But the metallic voices
I heard, the voice

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I heard booming out from the
corner of the room in Israel,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in Tel Aviv, I think in 1971
when the scientists came

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:11.340 align:middle line:84%
to test me, before I went
to the CIA, were real.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%
They were instructions.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out that
some other scientist called

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Jack Sarfatti, who is
from San Francisco,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and he is a physicist--

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
he witnessed and heard the
same type of metallic voice.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of wants to
connect it with what I heard.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But there were very
clear instructions

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:90%
by these metallic voices.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's no doubt in
my mind that right now

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
many of our viewers
will say, wait a minute.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Uri, you are right,
because I heard things.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:90%
It is in reality.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is a huge,
huge question mark.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:90%
What do they want?

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going towards?

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
What's the final
journey of the mind?

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:90%
That is still a big puzzle.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
By the way, throughout
this interview

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:84%
if you could hear pigeons, or
maybe a pigeon would fly in,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you
something that whenever

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
a pigeon flies into
our apartment--

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
we live in a tiny
apartment here--

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I know that that's my mother.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a sign from my mother.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple
of documentaries

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:90%
where they end the documentary.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I went to the place where I
was born, where the first spoon

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.060 align:middle line:90%
bent in my hand.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And as I go out to
the main living room,

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
a pigeon flies into
the living room.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
occurrence that happens

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:90%
since my mother passed away.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure a lot of people
now identify with that.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of spirits
come back as birds.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
And in my case, it's a pigeon.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So I would not be surprised
if around here my mother

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:90%
is somewhere in a pigeon form.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I am a great believer
in reincarnation.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
know my past lives.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
But the day I validated for
myself that reincarnation

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:90%
exists was the following.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I was on a stage in Israel.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:90%
This is going back to 1970.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And I would call people up on
the stage to hypnotise them

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So a Moroccan guy came
up, sat down on the chair,

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and I hypnotized him.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And I regressed him.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:84%
I told him at the
[NON-ENGLISH],, you are five.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:84%
At the [NON-ENGLISH],,
at the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
at the [NON-ENGLISH],, at the
[NON-ENGLISH],, you are four,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
three, two, one.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And now, tell me where you are.

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:90%
This is under one year of age.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Lo and behold, the Moroccan
guy, who is dark and complex,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.900 align:middle line:90%
he starts speaking Polish.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
language he was speaking.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.268 align:middle line:90%
So I turned to the audience.

00:22:45.268 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought is
this [NON-ENGLISH]??

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
What language is he speaking in?

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So a few people who were
from Poland, who knew Polish,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.000 align:middle line:90%
said he's speaking in Polish.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
I was stunned on the stage.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I said to
him, where are you?

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was describing that
he was on a cobbled pathway.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And it sounded like 17th, 16th
century, somewhere in Poland.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, I get goosebumps
because it was real.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So I basically,
through hypnosis,

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:90%
regressed him to his past life.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
When he woke up, he didn't
remember, of course.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But I asked him, did anyone
ever teach you Polish?

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:90%
He says, no.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So, to me, that was a
great and a pure validation

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:90%
of a past life.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:46.730 align:middle line:84%
So my conclusion about that
is that we have a choice.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Our mind can direct
us to one dimension.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter that
it's going on together.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:90%
There is a togetherness.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
These multidimensional
phenomenons

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.900 align:middle line:90%
are happening all the time.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Life is happening all the time.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Energies are buzzing around
like neutrons, like atoms.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:90%
It's happening all the time.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It's buzzing around.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But we have the choice to
travel wherever we want to.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
you can stop time.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Or the question
is, is there time?

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there is no time.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So if there is no time, it
means that everything is

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:90%
happening at the same moment.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But our mind can cling on
to, or patch itself, detach,

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
or attach to a happening
on an atomic level.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:90%
And we can live there.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
We can derive
information from there.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We can send information
to that entity.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I would like to tell you all
about my John Lennon egg story.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
John and I knew each other.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:90%
We met in New York.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:90%
One day John wakes me up.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I lived on 57th
Street and 1st avenue.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:84%
He lived in the Dakota
Building on the other side

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:90%
of Central Park.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Uri,
Uri, I gotta meet you.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Something incredible
happened to me.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:90%
John, look, what's the time?

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So I told him,
let's meet halfway.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So we met in the
lobby of a hotel.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:90%
We went aside.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:90%
We sat behind a curtain.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And he suddenly pulls
out from his pocket this.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll hold it in the
fist of my hand.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And he says, open your hand.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And I open my hand.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And he with his hand drops
this object into my hand.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it, and
I say, what is this?

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I was
lying in my bed,

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly at the foot of my
bed appeared a ball of light.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And it immediately
reminded me the sphere

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:84%
of light I've seen in the
Arabic garden when I was five.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And out of that sphere
of light or ball of light

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
hand came out.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost telepathic
that I stretched my hand.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And this ET hand put
this object into my hand.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want
you to have it.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I keep this with
me all the time.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I get so many emails from
people asking me, Uri,

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
why don't you test it?

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Test this metal alloy.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Have it analyzed.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And I say, no.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to analyze this.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to find
out that it's made in Taiwan.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I want to believe
John Lennon's words.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to believe that story.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.060 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe that story.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
interesting object,

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's much heavier
than what it looks like.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And also around December it
becomes slightly heavier.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it that it's heavier.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But also, around December,
if you kind of shake it,

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:84%
it feels like there
is something inside,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
like something is
rumbling inside.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But then December passes,
and it becomes solid again.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:90%
I tried to remote view this.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:90%
But why should I even?

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's from
an extraterrestrial being.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:90%
John believed in UFOs.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.560 align:middle line:90%
He UFOs.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:90%
He's seen UFOs.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:90%
He was a believer, like me.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.760 align:middle line:84%
When I'm being
asked, Uri Geller,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
what is your mission on this
planet, or in your life?

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I never really delve into that.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't go into that.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I am based
down to Earth.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:32.706 align:middle line:84%
I do strange, weird,
and bizarre things.

00:28:32.706 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I helped governments to
create positive conclusions

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:90%
to the work I've done for them.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I am an entertainer, because,
hey, say whatever you want.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Entertainer doesn't mean
that what I do is not real.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I always give an example
that you walk into a room

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and you see two Picasso
paintings on the wall.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:90%
One is a fake.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.680 align:middle line:90%
And one is real.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:90%
But they look the same.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And why did I bring this up?

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't really care
what people think about me.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, it's good
that I'm controversial.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's good that there is a
certain cut of people that

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:24.430 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in what I do.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But I know inside
my mind my mission.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It's always to do with
something positive,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:90%
with a positive outcome.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:10%
When I met Dr. Andrija
Puharich at the very early '70s

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:10%
I was led to
understand that there

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:10%
was an overall big mission.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.450 align:middle line:90%
That I had to do something.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But once again, in a way,
I ebbed away from it,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.720 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want to
take that responsibility.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I did not then or
today think that I'm

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:90%
the right person for that.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But by ebbing away in that
little journey of moving away

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:84%
from a major source, I
was doing little things

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that brought me back to
that source of energy,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.340 align:middle line:90%
to the bigger mission.

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I was feeding
the urge and the request

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:41.360 align:middle line:84%
of that higher entity
that injected into my mind

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that big mission that
I was asked to do.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:49.740 align:middle line:10%
I will not say what
it was and what it is.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But I know that throughout
the last 50 years

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I have fueled to the
content of that entity,

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to their satisfaction,
what I was

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:84%
asked to do in the
bigger picture,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:90%
and for the bigger picture.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:19.616 align:middle line:90%
