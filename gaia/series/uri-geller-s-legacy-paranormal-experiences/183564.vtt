00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Uri Geller,
and this is my Legacy.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Dowsing is one of
my abilities which

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I've done very successfully
throughout my life.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:10%
It started when I was a kid.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:10%
I could locate objects
my mother lost.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
She would ask me
where did I place

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
my scissors or the needles,
which are very tiny.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And I would just go
around the apartment--

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember, 6, 7-year-old,
I would find things.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I would locate,
later on in life,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
scientifically hidden objects
at Stanford Research Institute.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.065 align:middle line:84%
And I think the probabilities
were in the billions.

00:01:10.065 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm good at dowsing, and I don't
use dowsing rods, copper rods.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I very rarely use twigs.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I just use my hands.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I think that the twigs
and the dowsing rods

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:90%
are really tools for your mind.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:10%
And one of the big
finds that I always

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:10%
talk about was when General
Moshe Dayan asked me,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:10%
here in Israel, to drive
with him in his Jeep

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:10%
and locate ancient
archaeological items that

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:10%
were buried in sand and caves.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And we drove to
Ashkelon to the beach,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and I would just walk with
him with my hands stretched

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
And I would say, here, dig here.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And he would have
a shovel, and he

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%
would dig out whatever I found.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:90%
It's basically honing my mind.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
If I look for oil, then
I focus my mind onto oil.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I visualize oil.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
If I'm looking for an
ancient lamp or a sculpture

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of antiquity,
I just visualize

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
something very ancient.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And my mind allows me to
locate it very precisely.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:10%
I remember the time
when the president

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:10%
of Mexico, Lopez Portillo, asked
me to look for oil for Pemex.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Pemex is the national
oil company of Mexico.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a helicopter
over the Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I had a map on my
knees, and I would--

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
when I felt that I'm
flying over a place,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I would tell the pilot,
hover, come lower,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and then I would put
a big X on the map.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:90%
And they found oil there.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Oil came gushing out over there.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The president was so
impressed that he made me

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:90%
a Mexican citizen.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I actually have a
Mexican passport.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So then I worked for
mining companies.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:84%
I found gold for a
Brazilian mining company,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:84%
for an Australian
mining company.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So the mechanism I use is
I visualize an imaginary TV

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:90%
screen in my mind.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
And all of you can do it.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:84%
You can try-- well, just try
what I'm telling you to do.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:90%
You visualize a TV screen.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The background color
of this TV screen

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:84%
for me I paste a light pastel
green background in the TV.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Into this TV, I have to
bring in the location

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm looking for.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And now we find
dowsing for oil, I

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.120 align:middle line:84%
can see a black line appearing
in my imaginary TV screen

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and stopping in one place and
kind of expanding outwards

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
like a glob of ink that drops
from a pen on a white piece

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:90%
of paper.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Then I look down at the mat
and I let my hand guide me

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to that imaginary screen
that I see in my mind

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:90%
on to the marker I'm holding.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So I pinpoint the
exact location.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:90%
That's how I dowse.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing technique,
and I urge you all

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:90%
to actually try your powers.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Like, look, why don't
you all tomorrow,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
when you're standing in
a line in a supermarket,

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:84%
look at the back
of someone's head?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, before the till
there's a line of people.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Look at someone's head,
the back of their head.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't talk.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't even whisper.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
But telepathically, tell
that person turn around,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:90%
turn around, turn around.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I will say that eight out of
10 people will turn around,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and you will say,
wow, it really works.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
This beam, this energy, this
field of whatever is there.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Or something more beneficial--
you're looking for a car park

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
where you want to park your
car but there's no space,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
but there's a guy sitting
in a car across from you,

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and he's just sitting there.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So you just stare at
their face, at their head,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and you say, get out,
get out, get out.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Eight out of 10 people
will suddenly move away,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and you'll say,
thank you very much,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and you'll park your vehicle.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So there are little tests
that you can do yourselves--

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:90%
ESP, extrasensory perception.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Tell your friends to turn away.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:90%
You draw a drawing.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:90%
It's transmitted to them.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:90%
You think of a number.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
You transmit it.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So this way you enhance
your psychic abilities.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:90%
You train them.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:90%
You exercise them.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like lifting weights.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have
muscles here if you

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
didn't activate your muscles and
train your body or your heart.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
You do aerobics to strengthen
your heart and your lungs.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
You bring up your heart rate.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The same applies to your
mind, to your brain,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to your psychic
powers, to you're

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
dowsing abilities, to the field
of the paranormal in whole.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not just going
to happen to you.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Work on it.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Get working on this.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Believe in yourself.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And then, very soon--

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
it might take you a few
months, might take you a year,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
might take you two years,
but suddenly you'll

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.750 align:middle line:84%
find that you're good
at psychic abilities.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm so used to
doing this because I

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:10%
got to take you back to
the age of six, seven,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:10%
when I went to my local school
here in Tel Aviv, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I showed off with my talents
and my skills and my powers

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to teachers, to my
friends, to pupils.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I bent spoons.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:90%
I read minds.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%
I moved clocks on the walls.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:90%
I fixed broken watches.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I could move compass needles.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing this
as a game, showing off.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.770 align:middle line:90%
I wanted them to be bewildered.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I loved the reaction
from people.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So that was an automatic way
of exercising my abilities.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:84%
I never really
focused on what I was

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:84%
doing, what I was tuned
into, what frequency I was.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:90%
I just went with the flow.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:90%
I just go with the flow.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:90%
My entire career is--

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I have no
managers, I have no agents,

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I have never had PR people.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have image makers.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I just left the universal
energies coming to me

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.550 align:middle line:84%
guide me, tell me what
to do, and I listen.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:90%
I intuitively listen to things.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I absorb the positive
energies of the universe,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
and that built my career
and everything around me,

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:90%
so I just let it happen.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Oil companies and mining
companies came to me.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:90%
They saw my TV shows.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:84%
They saw me locate hidden
objects on TV shows.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So mining company
executives say, wait, hang

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
on, if you can do that,
why don't we use him?

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And the first request
came from no other

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.750 align:middle line:84%
than the chairman of
Rio Tinto Inc., which is

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:90%
a huge British mining company.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:10%
His name was Sir Val Duncan.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:10%
And I remember that he flew me
with Rio Tinto's private jet

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:10%
to Mallorca.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And he would test me.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
He would hide little film
cans, aluminum film cans.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.100 align:middle line:84%
He would pour oil in them
and hide them on the island

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and say, now, Uri, go and find
it, or little nuggets of gold.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And I would go out.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
This was fun for me, and
I would locate it for him.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, OK,
now, let me introduce you

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:90%
to big mining companies.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
This was Sir Val Duncan, the
head of Rio Tinto Inc., which

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:90%
the company still exists.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I did
things for Anglovaal

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa
for Clive Menell.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I did things
in Australia for Zanex.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So then I did things for a big
mining company and a big mogul

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
in Tokyo.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I always delivered the things.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:90%
I delivered the goods.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And you know what,
even if I'm not--

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:10%
even if I don't find
oil, even if I say,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:10%
you know what, I
don't feel it's there,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:10%
I saved the company
millions of dollars

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:10%
because otherwise they would
drill there and find nothing.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
All these things that I've
been telling you today

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:84%
are divided into segments
of the financial side,

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
the entertainment side,
and the ideological side.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Secret stuff-- CIA, Mossad, MI5,
MI6, intelligence services--

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.510 align:middle line:90%
never get paid.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I did it out of adventure,
out of my belief

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:90%
in my own ideological makeup.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Mining, gold, oil--

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I had to become
independently wealthy.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
rely on other people.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to help others.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be charitable.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be in a position
where I could help people--

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:90%
mainly sick children.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Hanna and I, my wife and I,
would fly terminally ill kids

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
to our house to
London to have fun.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to now
boast and show off

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:10%
with my charitable side.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're interested
in my charity stuff,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.300 align:middle line:90%
get on my website.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Go to my charity page, because
money doesn't motivate me.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
It motivated me
in the early '70s.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I was ruthless.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I was on an ego trip.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I was out for fame and fortune.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I wanted everything.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I was even sick.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:10%
I had bulimia because I
was so in a frenzy of fame

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:10%
and fortune.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:90%
But then I got sick.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was John Lennon
that looked at me one day

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and he said to me, Uri,
why aren't you spiritual?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
is spirituality?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him and
I said, I heard the word,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:90%
but what is it?

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And he said, go to
Japan and find out.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I listened to him.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I packed up.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Me, Hanna-- my wife--

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:90%
my mother, my children--

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Daniel, Natalie--
my brother-in-law,

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:90%
we got on a plane.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:90%
We flew to Japan.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:10%
I rented a car and
drove straight to Mt.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Fuji and we disappeared
into a forest.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a forest in a
tiny hut for an entire year.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:90%
That's where I found myself.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
That's where I learned about
spirituality, about positivity.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.640 align:middle line:84%
That's where I learned about
meditation, inspiration,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:90%
motivation, the white light.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment,
money was nothing to me.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a wallet.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't touch money,
nothing like that.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's my story.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.810 align:middle line:84%
You know that in the
past, I used to charge

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:90%
vast amounts of money.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.655 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't get out of the house
for less than a million dollars

00:13:49.655 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to find oil and gold.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said if I find,
if I don't find,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
a million dollars,
that's my fee.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And they paid, of course.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when I found, then
I got a little percentage.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:90%
But that's decades ago.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, it was
over the Amazon jungles,

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:84%
we were in a little
plane, and the pilot

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:90%
didn't find the airport.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And we had to land on the
Trans-Amazonas highway,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:90%
the road there.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself,
come on, Uri.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are
you doing, for what?

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
So to have a more million--

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
less, more, for me it wasn't
important at that stage,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:90%
especially after Japan.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And I quit.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I stopped it.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I was very valuable
for these mining companies

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:84%
because, you see, to find
oil and gold today, you've

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
got to spend tens of millions in
equipment, in airplanes pulling

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:90%
magnetometers, manpower, drills.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about tens
and tens of millions.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I come and I say, look,
I don't need all that.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Here is my hand.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Give me a million dollars,
and I'll find the oil.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
In the dowsing arena, I found
submarines, lost submarines.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to mention
names because some of them

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:90%
had nuclear weapons on.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:90%
I found downed airplanes.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I found, you know, other
top secret objects.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
But I know--

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I know that--

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I know where
the Ark of the Covenant is.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just in a very
sensitive place,

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
not easy to get
permission to excavate.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I know that there is
treasure on Ma Wan Island.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And I know that there are UFOs,
living UFOs, breathing UFOs,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.310 align:middle line:84%
breathing crafts, in certain
points around our planet.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say no more.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that if you go
to the core of our planet,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, the core of
our planet is made out

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:90%
of a rotating crystal.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:90%
What is the core of our planet?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe and I know that
it's a rotating crystal.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's rock
crystal, what type of crystal.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But crystals, you know,
throughout century,

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
it has been said about crystals
of their healing powers.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
have healing powers.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in Mexico,
and I have to show

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
you this because
it's fascinating--

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:84%
first of all, this is
one of my first books,

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show it
to you close up.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:09.229 align:middle line:84%
This is me here and the wife
of the president of Mexico.

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:14.315 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the Mexican
pyramids, Mayan pyramids.

00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a gun
that I got as a gift

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
from the president of
Mexico, Lopez Portillo.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.260 align:middle line:84%
But I also got
another gift from him.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is fantastic
because what it is,

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:90%
it's a crystal skull.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, what he told me--

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and I want to be precise, and
this is why I wrote it down.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.530 align:middle line:84%
This is what Lopez
Portillo told me.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
This crystal skull is called,
in Spanish, [SPANISH],,

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:84%
which I guess is the
skull of destiny.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was found in the
Temple of Inscription.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm not mistaken, in
the Temple of Inscription,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:84%
there was also a
plaque made from stone,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
found of an ancient astronaut,
if you didn't know that.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a person
sitting with a lot

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.920 align:middle line:10%
of mechanical kind
of futuristic tools

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.835 align:middle line:10%
around him, like
he's guiding a UFO.

00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
What else I wrote that
it was found in 18--

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
this was found in 1860 by
a Mexican archaeologist.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's also a rumor
that it has connections

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.385 align:middle line:90%
to Chichen Itza in the Yucatan.

00:18:51.385 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And another person told me
that it was found in 1950,

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
so I don't quite know the story
of this amazing, mystical,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious
rock crystal skull.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But I googled, and I found
out that there are 13 skulls

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:90%
like this on this planet.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is the chief one.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the main one.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
be here in my museum.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And I do feel--

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a rock look.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's face, it rock crystal.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, NASA-- did you know that
NASA uses tiny crystals that

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
are attached to an
aluminum pad to balance

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:90%
the weight of astronauts?

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
quartz watches that keep

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
the most precise
time in the world

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:90%
have a little crystal chip?

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
computers have crystals.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So crystals play a
major part in our lives.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And for the ancient Mayans
and the prehistoric people

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that started mankind to
receive this type of knowledge,

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
it must've come from the stars.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:10%
Look at the elongated
brain of this creature.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine if we today
say that our minds are

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
computers in the universe?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine the
mind of this creature

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that still, I believe, visits
us and travels to planet Earth

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.750 align:middle line:90%
and beyond?

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think we are
being tested by them.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
giving us knowledge.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think
governments want to put

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
their hand on that knowledge.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you've got
the stories of Area 51

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and all of these stories of
pieces of metal from crafts.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
That's this story, and this
is my skull close to my heart.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm so universally my way
of thinking in the pattern

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.235 align:middle line:90%
of my mind that I really--

00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
say, I don't care,

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:84%
but I just want to
go on and continue

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:90%
in different dimensions.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:10%
Legacy-wise, you know, I'm so
well-known around the world

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:10%
for spoon bending that recently
I told my wife that, why

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:10%
don't you create a huge spoon
on my tombstone so when people

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:10%
pass they say, ah,
what's a bent spoon

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:10%
doing on Uri Geller's grave?

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And that will bring a
smile to their faces.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.380 align:middle line:90%
That's my legacy.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:90%
