>> I'm Uri Geller,
and this is my Legacy.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:10%
I would describe
myself, Uri Geller,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:10%
as a person that
actually shocked

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:10%
the world with something
quite trivial and surprising.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.960 align:middle line:84%
You see, I always say
that the secret of success

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:90%
is originality.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with something
original, something

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:90%
that was never seen before.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So I really shocked the
world with that feat.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I look at myself as someone,
maybe a freak of nature,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little advanced,
ahead of my time,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.655 align:middle line:84%
maybe something that
triggered my mind power.

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
My mental abilities began
at a very early age.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:10%
First of all, very
few people know this,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:10%
but when I was about a year
old, my mother put me in a pram

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:10%
under a window.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
At that time in Israel,
it was Palestine,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and the British were the
rulers in Israel, in Palestine.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And a British soldier shot
two bullets into our window

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
from across the
railroad station.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
I remember the glass
shattering, falling slow motion

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:90%
onto my face.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.305 align:middle line:84%
There was a little Teddy
bear that covered my face,

00:02:13.305 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happened to me.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't even scratched.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:90%
So maybe that was a shock.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that was the
actual trigger.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.250 align:middle line:10%
The second experience
that happened to me

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:10%
that definitely falls into
the category of a shock

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:10%
is the following.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm about five years old.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm playing in an Arabic
garden, magical garden.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And I heard kittens cry.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And as a five-year-old,
I'm looking for them.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, out of nowhere, I
see a huge sphere of light.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:90%
It's throbbing.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a living entity,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
but it was just a
sphere, a ball of fire.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I look at this
phenomena, and then I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
can see with my eyes
a beam, almost--

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I describe it today
as a laser beam.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:84%
It hits my forehead,
and it was so tangible--

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:90%
it's so powerful--

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that it pushes me
into the grass.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know how
long I lay in the grass,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
but I ran home to
tell my mother.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
She didn't believe me.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
She thought that I was either
dreaming, fantasizing, lying,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
making it up, but, no,
I wasn't making it up.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It happened.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I adhered to
this story through all my life.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:90%
I didn't ebb away from it.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about it in my books.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I talked about it
on documentaries,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and really, people thought,
come on, this is so far out.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It can't be true.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And recently, an Israeli
Air Force officer

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:90%
validated this entire scene.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
this amazing encounter--

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll call it encounter--

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:90%
on a program on the BBC.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
That documentary
was shown in Israel.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And I get an email from a
man called Jacobi, who says,

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:90%
hey, Uri, I was there.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:90%
I saw that sphere.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I saw you.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I saw a little
boy running home--

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
because the apartment building
was very near the garden.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:90%
It was maybe 50 meters away.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And he actually
validated this story.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.987 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow!

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I grabbed the phone.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:90%
I called him.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I came to Israel.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I filmed him, and
he says that when

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:84%
I ran away from the sphere of
light, the sphere followed me.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I got into our
entrance, into the doorway,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:84%
the sphere exploded on
the facade of our building

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and kind of tarnished
it in a dark residue.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So there I had a
validation that, no,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.330 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't making up a story.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't dreaming it.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
When I am asked today
what I think that was,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I have a few theories.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
most rational one,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:84%
that it was some kind of
a geophysical phenomena.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes the earth
releases different gases and--

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.650 align:middle line:90%
who knows?

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But they form bubbles and so--
maybe that was a very simple--

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
has a simple
scientific explanation.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Next theory, that it could have
been a spiritual encounter,

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
something to do
with religion maybe,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
something to do with my
belief system, something

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that I created with my
mind, but it was tangible.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It was there.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I could touch it.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
The third theory is
the most far-out one--

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that I really had
an alien encounter.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I did not see an alien being.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see the grays
with the big eyes.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:90%
I saw this sphere.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But after I told this
story over and over,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I get thousands of emails
from people telling me,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.000 align:middle line:84%
we had the same
encounter, and we

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
believe it was some kind
of a UFO visitation.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
It was some kind of an
extraterrestrial being trying

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with us.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.230 align:middle line:90%
I am a believer.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing I
do not believe in.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe in infinity, so
everything is possible.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there are UFOs.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there are aliens.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Very soon after this encounter
in this magical Arabic garden,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm eating soup.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm lifting a spoon
up towards my mouth.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.725 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the spoon
bends and breaks.

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm left holding the handle
of the spoon, which maybe I'll

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:90%
demonstrate later.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So my mother looks at me,
and I look at the handle,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
but what does a five and a
half, six-year-old kid know?

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
My mother, again,
wasn't surprised.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And she thought, oh, well, maybe
powers and the paranormal--

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, we didn't know
the word paranormal then.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought
to myself, hang on--

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:90%
spoon-- can I do it again?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And again?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So I tried it in
school, and I tried it,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and I showed it to
my mother's friends.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was shocked,
surprised, amazed, aghast,

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to say, what is this?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:84%
That's when I realized that
I had something-- something

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:90%
different, something unique.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.000 align:middle line:90%
My friends in school--

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
pupils-- they were
good in basketball.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:90%
They were good in soccer.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:90%
They were good in arithmetic.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
I was very average, but
I was good at bending

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:90%
spoons and reading minds.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And the way I discovered
that I could read minds was--

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I was not good in
mathematics, in arithmetic--

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
so I could concentrate on
the back of a pupil's head,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
and I would copy the answer.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
The teacher didn't know
how I got the answer

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
right when the equation
was wrongly written.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Then I could look at the
clock on the wall, will it

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:90%
to move an hour ahead.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So I started discovering
things that I

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:90%
could do at a very early age.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Later on in life, I
had to label myself.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.995 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I had to
always reinvent myself.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.560 align:middle line:90%
And today, I look at it as--

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena, I see it as
the field of the paranormal.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.995 align:middle line:84%
There is a section of it
that is mind over matter

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
or psychokinesis,
telepathy, the ability

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:90%
to do extrasensory perception.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.747 align:middle line:90%
But I was always controversial.

00:09:49.747 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Even in school, even
when I was seven, eight,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:84%
nine-year-old,
children and teachers

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how to gather--
how to digest this thing.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Some thought I was a magician.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Some thought it was just some
kind of a mind over matter

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knew.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And I realized then
that this is what's

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
going to push me out of poverty,
because we were very poor.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:90%
My mother was a seamstress.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.045 align:middle line:90%
My father was a womanizer.

00:10:28.045 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:90%
He was never at home.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember me and my mom
walking to the flea market.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
She would buy old
American parachutes

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
from which she
would sew dresses.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
We would collect
plastic Bakelite spoons

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
after people would
eat their ice creams,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and she would wash
them and resell them.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:90%
We were broke.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:10%
And as I was growing up, I used
my extrasensory perception,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:10%
for instance, to make my
mother win in card games.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:10%
She would take me to
a little card club.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
She would play rummy, and
I would sit next to her.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.420 align:middle line:10%
And I could look at the
cards of the other players,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:10%
which, obviously, you can't see.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:90%
But I always knew--

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I detected who had the
joker, or who had two jokers.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would kick my
mother's leg to tell her

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:90%
which person had the joker.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it was
kind of cheating,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
but I could do that
telepathically.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And my mother would
win quite a lot

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:84%
of money, which would help our
existence because she had to--

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
she was the earner
in the family.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:90%
My father wasn't around.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Then my parents
divorced, and my mother

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
married a Hungarian Jew
who lived in Cyprus.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:90%
I was 11-- didn't know English.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So I left Israel, and
suddenly, a whole new culture

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:84%
opens up-- different
religions, Turks and Greeks.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:84%
The British also occupied
Cyprus at that time.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about 1957.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And my school was called
Terra Santa College.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
It was up on a hill,
and around the school,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:90%
there were hundreds of caves.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And we would go down into
the caves to explore.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, on a few
occasions, we got lost,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and I would use my mental
powers to lead the kids out

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:90%
of the caves.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.108 align:middle line:84%
So I would use these
abilities in different areas.

00:12:35.108 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was dowsing.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was using my
extrasensory perception waves,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:90%
almost like a sonar.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I used to do these
different and unusual things.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And, again, everybody
was just, wow!

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And I already then felt that I
was entertaining also people.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, my stepfather died a year
after my mother married him.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And we lived running this
little hotel which had 14 rooms.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
The Mossad, the
Israeli secret service,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
discovered that
we're from Israel,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and they turn this hotel
into a Mossad safe house.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
Mossad agents, spies.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
They would check in,
and from there, they

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
would go to spy, you
know, in Syria, Egypt.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
One day, I approach
one of these agents.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:90%
I must have been 12.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
His name was Yoav Shacham, and
I told him, Yoav, you're a--

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
or you're a spy, aren't you?

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.956 align:middle line:90%
He was, what?

00:13:53.956 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:90%
How do you know?

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.530 align:middle line:90%
Why you saying these things?

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:84%
To make a long story short,
I became, at 12 years of age,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:90%
a spy for Israel.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:90%
You know what I did?

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I bent a spoon for him, and
I did telepathy with him.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
And he would tell me--

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:90%
he would give me instructions--

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm leaving now
the hotel, but I'm

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:90%
going to send you letters.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Don't open them.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll get on the
bicycle and give them--

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.360 align:middle line:84%
hand them into the hand
of the Israeli consul--

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
in a consulate, which wasn't
far away from our little hotel

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
establishment.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
that he was spying,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:90%
say, in Egypt or in Syria.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:84%
He would send secret
information in letter forms

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:90%
in the envelopes.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I jumped on the bike and drove
them down to the consulate.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I was
acting for the Mossad.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And then Yoav says to me, Uri,
I can't understand your powers,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
but you are helping us.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go back to
Israel when you're 18,

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
join the paratroopers,
go to officer's school,

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and then find me.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And I told him, Yoav, how
am I going to find you?

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find me because
we are going to use you.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:10%
You have amazing very special
abilities that we need.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm asked many times if
I'm unique in my family,

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
possessing these abilities,
these skill, these powers--

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
call it whatever.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm an only child.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, I'm going
to touch on something very

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:90%
sensitive and very emotional.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:84%
You see, my father
didn't want children.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And he forced my mother to
go through eight abortions.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And my mother fought for me,
so maybe there is a connection

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
because I do feel
that, around me, I

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
must have my brothers
and sisters, maybe

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:13.550 align:middle line:84%
an angelic form,
angels, spirits.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm not alone.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
That was a shock to me when
my mother told me that.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:10%
So today, I'm-- no
brothers, no sisters.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.190 align:middle line:84%
In my family, my son
Daniel, when he was young,

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.920 align:middle line:84%
he could maybe do
some telepathy,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.520 align:middle line:90%
but they tried bending spoons.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
My daughter Natalie tried
many times, but no one could.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said before
that the secret of success

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:90%
is originality.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And there's nobody who did
spoon bending before me.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.440 align:middle line:90%
And how did that come about?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting-- I was
on a major television

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:90%
show on the BBC in 1972.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
It was called the
"David Dimbleby Show."

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
how it came about.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting-- around me,
skeptical scientists--

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
and David Dimbleby
hands me a spoon.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And he says, show
us your powers!

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hold a spoon, and
suddenly, I do something

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:90%
that I've never done before.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I look into the camera, like
this, and I hold up this spoon,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and I say, everybody at home!

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Go and get your spoons!

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that I sent 10
million people to the kitchen.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Everybody came back
to the TV screens

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
holding a spoon because
no one could fathom--

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
believe that spoons are going
to bend in their own homes,

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:84%
in the living rooms in
Scotland, in Wales, in England--

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and this
is what happened.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminding you what
happened on that show.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I hold a spoon, and I
stroke it very gently.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I look at it, and I
say bend, melt, bend, melt,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:90%
and look--

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the metal is becoming
almost like plastic--

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Plastic, see no
heat is produced.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I say bend, melt,
bend-- and look,

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.145 align:middle line:84%
and then I went like
that, and the spoon broke.

00:18:42.145 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
[ECHOING] Bend, bend,
melt, melt, bend, bend,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:90%
melt, melt, melt.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
happened the instant

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:90%
the spoon broke on the BBC?

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The BBC's telephone system
blows up, not because of me,

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
not because of my energies,
but because spoons

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.150 align:middle line:90%
were bending in people's homes.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
When the phone calls were
coming in, at that time,

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
the system couldn't take 100,000
calls at the same moment.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And the phenomena was
huge, not only spoons bend,

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
but watches stopped,
watches moved,

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:84%
pictures tilted on the
walls, lights flickered.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
This was a mass phenomenon
all over England.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
The next day, the headlines
screamed, Uri Geller Puts

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:90%
England in a Bend.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
That's when I realized, wow, I
can entertain people and blow

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
their minds at the same
time with something, to me,

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.010 align:middle line:90%
is very trivial.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
When I'm asked, Uri
Geller, are you a magician,

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:90%
or are you real?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And my answer is crystal clear.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:90%
What I do is real.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And when people ask me,
well, how do you do it?

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I can only explain the process
that goes through my mind.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Today, I do it--

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:90%
if I'm in the mood, I do it.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I just touch a spoon.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:90%
I think, bend.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think
bend any more.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I visualize it bent, broken,
whatever-- it happens.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I can talk to
people when I do it.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I would
command the metal to bend.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I would say bend,
bend, melt, melt.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Or when I sprout a red radish
seed, I say sprout, sprout.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So I want to believe
that there is

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
a process of some energy
that leaves my mind.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with my finger.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with distance.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I can do it from afar.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It takes me more time--

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
the thicker the metal,
the more time it takes me.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
These spoons are from
across the coffee shop.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.190 align:middle line:90%
They are thin, so it's easy.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:90%
There is an energy.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And let me take
you back to 1924.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:84%
A very, very clever scientist
comes up with a super-amazing

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:90%
equation--

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
e equals mc square.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you all know
that it was Albert Einstein.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
What did it mean by
e equals mc square?

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.880 align:middle line:84%
In very simple terms,
Albert Einstein

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
proved scientifically that
everything in the universe

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.770 align:middle line:90%
is made from energy.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Your energy-- you, you at home,
you are watching the screen--

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:90%
your body, your energy.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I am energy.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.740 align:middle line:90%
The chair--

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.540 align:middle line:90%
[TAPPING SOUNDS]

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:90%
--you hear it?

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:30.860 align:middle line:90%
It's solid?

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not solid.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:90%
It's energy.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:90%
The spoon is energy.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It's vibrating in
such a frequency

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that, to us, it feels
solid, but it's not.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So when I manipulate a spoon,
when I stroke it gently,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and when I command it to bend,
or break, or melt, or grow,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:84%
or move, I produce
an energy wave.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe it comes
out from my finger.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe it comes
out from my mind,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and it penetrates the molecular
structure of the metal.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.955 align:middle line:84%
I've done secret
stuff, for instance,

00:23:12.955 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
at Lawrence Livermore
Radiation Labs, where

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:90%
they build nuclear weapons.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
I've done secret experiments
at the American Naval Surface

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Weapons, where they
introduced Nitinol--

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Nitinol-- a metal
that has memory.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.970 align:middle line:84%
When you bend it physically,
you immerse it in hot water,

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:84%
boiling water, it'll spring
back to its original shape.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I screwed up the
memory of that metal.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.220 align:middle line:84%
It didn't go back to
its original shape.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So I must be violating some
kind of a law of physics

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
by changing a
molecular structure.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said all this,
maybe I'm totally wrong.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is not it.

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm deriving
or I'm extracting

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:84%
some kind of a power, some
kind of a universal energy

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:90%
from outside me.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it has nothing
to do with my mind.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is some kind of
an intelligence above me,

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.960 align:middle line:84%
a super force, a
thinking entity, that

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:90%
does this thing through me.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:90%
This is so far out.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
This is such a far-out
theory, but it all has to--

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
it all goes back to
the hypnotic sessions

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I had with Dr. Andrija Puharich,
who was a medical doctor.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.410 align:middle line:90%
He was an inventor.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not mistaken, he
invented the oxygen mask

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
to fighter pilots, and
very credible scientist.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:10%
And we went through something
so bizarre, so freaky,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.650 align:middle line:10%
when he came to test
me in Israel that, when

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:10%
he wrote about it, I had to--

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.080 align:middle line:10%
I didn't debunk it
because, hey, it happened

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:10%
in front of my very own eyes.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:90%
He would stick a Sony TC tape--

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:84%
at those times,
there were tapes--

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:90%
into a Sony tape recorder.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I, in front of my
very own eyes, I

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
would see disappear,
dematerialize.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I've seen dematerializations--
I mean, I had--

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I, my body, went through
something so unbelievable

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that maybe Arthur C.
Clarke would believe it,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
or writers of science
fiction movies.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And when I tell these stories,
I diminish my credibility

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
because people today say,
OK, so he can bend a spoon.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:90%
What's a big deal?

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:84%
A spoon-- you can bend
it physically like that,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
or you can bend
it with your mind.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you talk
about dematerializing,

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
things vanishing,
you're taking it way--

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:90%
a step way far out.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:90%
But do you know what?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many millions
of people around the world

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
experience driving a car, and
suddenly, they're miles ahead?

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Time disappears!

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize that almost
70% of all Americans

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.810 align:middle line:84%
believe in something
paranormal--

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in UFOs, in alien beings,
in ESP, in angels?

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the list goes on and on.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Almost 70%, so there must
be some truth to that bigger

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.080 align:middle line:90%
picture out there.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:84%
You see, I'm a huge
believer in Carl Jung's word

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that he coined
up, synchronicity.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything that happens in the
universe happens for a reason.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:90%
There's no coincidence.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, there might be, but
the overall bigger picture

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.343 align:middle line:84%
in things that happen
to you in your life,

00:27:24.343 --> 00:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
or to other people,
that bring you

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:90%
together are synchronicities.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
If I would have to sum up
this whole fantastical trip,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:43.020 align:middle line:84%
a journey of my life, is that,
no doubt, consciousness exists.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Super consciousness exists.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:90%
Mammoth consciousness exists.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And to our viewers right now,
everything is possible in life.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Remember that there is nothing
that you cannot be, do,

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.470 align:middle line:84%
or have because your mind power
can materialize things for you.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Your mind ability, your
super consciousness,

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:90%
can do things for you.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:84%
If you think positive, you're
sending that message out

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:84%
to that universe, and it
brings it back to you.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So in a nutshell, my
advice is think positive,

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:84%
believe in yourself, but
also, wake up in the morning

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and put yourselves in an
attitude of gratitude.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:90%
