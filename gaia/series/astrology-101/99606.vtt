00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.360 align:middle line:10%
RICK LEVINE: The three
astrological water signs are

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.800 align:middle line:10%
Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:10%
Astrologically, the element
of water represents emotion.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's feelings.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Water, like
feelings, has memory.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
memory of water.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Feelings require some
connection to the past.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It's different, though,
for each of the signs,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.360 align:middle line:90%
what we do with those feelings.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:84%
In the Jungian framework, water
also represented feelings.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
The fire, earth, air, water
represented intuitive thinking,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:90%
feeling, and perceiving.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Water has to do
with the emotions

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that we have based upon our
perceptions or our analysis.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
The first of the three
water signs is Cancer.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And Cancer is a cardinal, or
season-starting, water sign.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is the sign of the crab.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is just Latin for crab.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.340 align:middle line:84%
The distinguishing features
of the crab are one,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%
it has a hard outer shell.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:90%
And two, it has large pinchers.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Those large pictures prevent it
from running forward very fast.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who has studied crabs
knows that they can run faster

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
sideways or backwards
than forwards, just

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:84%
like the people that you know
who are Cancer sun signs.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about the pinchers

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
is that when they grab on to
something they do not let go.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that when a
crab reaches into a crevasse

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and it picks up a piece of food,
if the food is so large that it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
then can't pull
its claw back out,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
it'll pull its arm
right out of its body.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Crabs do not let go.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The tenacity of emotion is
what's significant in crabs.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the crab that will
hold on to the past.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Cancers are associated
with home and family.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And home and family are our
associations with our past.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:90%
Our family are our blood ties.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And the homes that
we all live in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:90%
are like our hard outer shell.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we're inside
our home with our family,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
that's when we feel
safe and secure.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The other piece of importance
about the anatomy of the crab

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:90%
is the hard outer shell.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And this has to do with
the fact that Cancers

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:90%
do not have backbones.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounds awful
to us vertebrates,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
but the fact of the matter
is that the exoskeleton

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:90%
is what protects the crab.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is the crab
that will find-- not only

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:84%
has a hard outer shell-- but
will find the hard outer shell

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
of an animal who's not using it
because it's afraid of getting

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:90%
washed away by the tides.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's so afraid, that it'll
then take that larger, harder

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
outer shell, and it'll
drag it into a cave

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
or under a rock, because crabs
live in the most changing,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
dynamic, and nutrient-rich
place on the planet,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:84%
the intertidal zone, where
the waters are always moving.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And the waters of emotion
are always moving.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is why crabs need their
hard outer shell because they

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
can be so sensitive to the
changing emotional tides,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:84%
that they can actually
hide their feelings better

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
than any other
sign in the zodiac.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, except for maybe
Scorpio sometimes.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio is the
fixed water sign.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio does not flow like
the crab's feelings of flows.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio holds on to
feelings and develops

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:90%
then into great intensity.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
Scorpion, it takes

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
all of the energy of its
body and it pushes it

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
further and further
into its tail,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:90%
where it becomes very poisonous.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And that energy is held in
position, ready to strike when

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:90%
the scorpion on is fearful.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Scorpios, perhaps more than
any other sign of the zodiac,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.580 align:middle line:90%
is associated with intensity.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And because it's a water
sign, it's associated

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:90%
with emotional intensity.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio can take a feeling and
hold onto it like no one else.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And not so much holding on to
the past, but holding onto it,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Scorpio loves revenge.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio loves mystery
because it's the feelings

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:90%
that are not shown.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
power of feelings

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes becomes greater when
the feelings aren't expressed.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And Scorpio can
take those feelings

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
and develop power and
intensity from them

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
by pushing them so
far away that they

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:90%
look like they don't exist.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter is,
that Scorpio is the only sign

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
in the zodiac that
actually has three animal

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
totems associated
with it, the scorpion,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:90%
the eagle, and the dove.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And herein lies the
secret important thing

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
about the feelings of the
fixed sign of Scorpio,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and that is when you hold
onto a feeling, it transforms.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And it transforms, first in
the eagle, where the eagle can

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
actually hold onto
its feelings and soar

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:90%
higher than any other creature.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And then as it
learns how to deal

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
with its passions
and its intensity

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and its need for
revenge, the eagle

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
then transforms into the
dove that is 100% peaceful

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and could not kill at all.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And so in Scorpio,
we have this idea

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of the transformation
on emotions

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:90%
from holding them still.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
In the third and final
water sign, Pisces,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
we have the fish that
live in the water.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And the water here
represents not only the seas,

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:90%
bu the seas of consciousness.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:84%
We are each and every one of
us fish with the same eternal

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:90%
waters flowing through us.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
We all have crystallized out of
the great ocean here on earth

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and eventually all
life and all solidness,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
all crystalline structure,
will wash back into earth.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Pisces represents that
spiritual component

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universal
consciousness or the universal

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
sees that we all come
to through birth,

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and at death we
all wash back into.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.751 align:middle line:84%
Pisces people tend to be very
sensitive to other people's

00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:90%
feelings.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a difficulty
in telling well,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is that my feeling
or your feeling,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
because Pisces often has a
difficult time with boundaries.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Pisces are attracted
to anything in life that helps

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
them lose those firm
boundaries, whether they're

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
religious beliefs or
spiritual practices,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
or even illusions or delusions
or fantasies or movies,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
these are all things that
Pisces might be associated.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
In each of the three water
signs, feelings are involved,

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:84%
but they're involved
differently.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
In Cancer, they're
personal feelings

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
based upon insecurity often
and the need to protect them.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
In Scorpio, they're
based upon rigidness,

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
upon fixed feelings, that then
transform into something else.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And in Pisces, they're based
upon the universal feelings

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:90%
that we all share.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:90%
