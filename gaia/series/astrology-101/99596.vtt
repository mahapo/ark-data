00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:10%
The astrological fire signs
are Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.730 align:middle line:10%
In astrology, each
of the elements

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:10%
represents a way of
manifesting, and fire

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:10%
has to do with direct action.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle line:90%
Fire burns.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Fire doesn't think about what
it's going to be doing next.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have any feelings.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
There is no sensation
that fire has.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Fire, once it's started,
just keeps going, burning up

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.140 align:middle line:90%
what it can as it goes along.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact in the Jungian model,
fire is called intuition,

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.340 align:middle line:84%
although we think
of it as action,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:84%
because with intuition
there's no thinking

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:90%
about what it's going to do.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
It just does it, based upon
what it kind of assumes it needs

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:90%
to do in order to stay burning.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Fire is represented in
the zodiac by three signs,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:90%
as each of the elements are.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Aries represents cardinal
fire or starting fire.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:90%
Aries are the fire starters.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Aries is enthusiastic, but it's
not necessarily persistent.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
The Aries basically
gets the fire going.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The Aries person
is the person who's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:84%
the pioneer, who's not afraid
to jump into something new.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Aries is the person who
can go into a situation

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
that he or she has
never been in before

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and just figure it
out along the way,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
like fire figures out
what it's going to burn.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
However, Aries is like a pile
of hay that when it burns,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:90%
it burns hot, and it burns fast.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:90%
And then it's done.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Aries, accordingly, often
has a difficult time

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.420 align:middle line:84%
finishing what it starts because
the enthusiasm is short lived.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:90%
The second fire sign is Leo.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Leo is the fixed fire sign.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Fixed signs hold a position.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Leo is like the
summer sun that blazes

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:90%
every day in the same place.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:90%
Leo is immovable.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:90%
It's fixed.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's determined.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.310 align:middle line:90%
It basically keeps showing up.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Leos are legendary for
their loyalty and love.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Leo, in a way, comes
from the heart,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and it holds that
love no matter what.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like the unconditional love
of the sun that keeps shining

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
happens here on Earth,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and, accordingly,
Leo can sustain

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the fire for long
periods of time

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and theoretically
even indefinitely.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:84%
The third fire sign
is Sagittarius,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and in Sagittarius, we have
what's called the mutable

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:90%
or changeable fire sign.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And Sagittarius isn't interested
in starting the fires,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:10%
like Aries.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:10%
It's not necessarily
about sustaining it.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's about gaining
perspective on the fire.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a
fire from far away,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that's the energy
of Sagittarius.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:90%
Aries is the bonfire.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Leo is the fire of the hearth
that keeps the heat going

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
through the winter,
and Sagittarius

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:90%
is the fire of a distant star.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
the sky at night

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and you see these millions
of points of light,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
they just look like points of
light, yet each one of them

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:90%
is a sun just like our sun.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Accordingly, the
fire of Sagittarius

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
is often cool, cool compared
to the heat of Aries or of Leo,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's cool because
it has distance.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the fire
of romance, as in Leo,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
or the fire of physical
love, as in Aries,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
in Sagittarius it's
the fire of friendship.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.220 align:middle line:84%
It's that inspiration that
fuels us to make relationships

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that are not based
upon physicality,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
but they're based upon ideals.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius has to
do with distance,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and the fire of
Sagittarius is perspective.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that something
exists, warm or hot,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that's far away and
eventually will change--

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:84%
because all mutable signs
change-- into whatever

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.990 align:middle line:90%
the next element is.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
the fire fading out,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
but it's still
within our awareness.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It's still within our
consciousness, and yet

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
all three fire signs
each share the idea

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
of heat from
different perspectives

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
or in different stages
of their development.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:90%
