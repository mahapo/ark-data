00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.310 align:middle line:10%
RICK LEVINE: The
astrological air signs are

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.080 align:middle line:10%
Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:10%
Air signs have to
do with thinking.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Air is the least physical
of the four elements fire,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%
earth, air and water.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Air is up in the air.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:90%
It's someone who's not grounded.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Air signs are intellectual.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Air signs have to do with
the movement of energy, which

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:90%
often occurs as a thought.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So subtle, that it may not have
impact in the three dimensions

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
In the Jungian modality air
had to do with thinking.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
The air sign has to do with how
the mind processes information

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and how we perceive things
and turn them into thoughts.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
The first of the
air signs is Gemini.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I think of Gemini as the
tap dancers of the zodiac,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
because Gemini, it's
always in motion.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:90%
There's an adaptability.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a changeability
to Gemini.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Gemini is the person
that can be absolutely

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
clever and funny one moment and
very serious the next moment.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Gemini is the person
who has words flowing

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
off his or her tongue
faster than they

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:90%
can even think about them.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Geminis are the con
artists of the zodiac.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Geminis can be very clever,
and to use a British saying,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:90%
sometimes too clever by half.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Geminis can be so
clever that they avoid

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:90%
things that are important.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of
Gemini ultimately

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
engaging information

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously, whether it's
this way, that way, up or down.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Gemini is always moving.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
It's restless.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And that the basis
of Geminis, is there

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:84%
adaptability and
their ability to move

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
with the changing events.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:90%
The second air sign is Libra.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And Libra is a cardinal or
season starting air sign.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Libra has to do with air,
with intellect, with thought.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:90%
But Libra is the balance.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And in Libra we're taking our
thoughts and we're weighing,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're judging,
and we're balancing

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:90%
them against other thoughts.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Libra has to do with
the idea of beauty

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:90%
as an intellectual function.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Libra has to do with an
idea of aesthetic values.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Libra is balancing and
weighing and judging,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and as this season starting
sign, or cardinal sign,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Libra will engage other people
to find a balance point.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Libra is the sign
of relationships.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Libra, because it
engages the other,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:84%
always has an inner and
an outer, a me and a you.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
There's always
opposites in Libra.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
always opposites

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:90%
in each of the air signs.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
In Gemini, they're always
communicating with each other.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.270 align:middle line:84%
In Libra, they're
looking to find balance.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Libra as the original
shuttle diplomat, Libra

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:90%
is looking to be the go between.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Libra people often
are great hosts

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
or hostesses because
they want to make

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:90%
things OK for everyone else.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Libra is the sign
that intellectually,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
mentally wants everything
to be perfectly in place.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And as such, it's
often associated

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
with art, because art,
everything has to be in place.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
The interior designer is
using that Libran function

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:84%
of trying to balance the harmony
of the inner and the outer.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is the third
of the air signs,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and it is the fixed air side.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:84%
It is arguably the
weirdest of the air signs.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's arguably the
weirdest of the 12 signs.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius is the water bearer.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And we want to think
of it as a water sign,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:90%
but it's an air sign.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%
You see, air contains moisture.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And Aquarius
represents that idea

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that without moisture in the
air, without water in the air,

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:90%
it can't conduct electricity.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
We've all seen those
amazing lightning storms.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And in a lightning
storm, the electricity

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:90%
sparks because it's held back.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:84%
There needs to be
dryness meeting

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:90%
moisture in a lightning storm.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
What happens with
Aquarius is that the water

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:90%
comes through the air.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the intellect,
but it's the ideas that

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:90%
are carried on the intellect.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is also, arguably,
the most intelligent

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
of not only the three air
signs, but of all the signs,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's great
at taking the ideas

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and expanding them to a fixed--
it's a fixed sign-- to a fixed

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:90%
conclusion, which is universal.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So instead of talking
about love verses

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
hate, for example, in Aquarius
it's the concept of love.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Its universal principles, truth.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the
principal is, Aquarius

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to take it to its
widest conceptual framework

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:84%
where it actually loses touch
with emotions, with humanness.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
It basically goes outward so far
that it just becomes an idea.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius likes to fit in.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same time,
it's totally individualistic

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:90%
and totally separate.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
We think of Aquarius
as the non-conformist

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
because it has an unusual
take on everything,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
but Aquarius is the nervous
system itself, not the messages

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:90%
that are being carried.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is the
distribution of information

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:90%
throughout the entire universe.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have the three
air signs, each having

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
to do with thinking, each
having to do with intellect,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
but in a different
phase of it, where

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
we have each of
them representing

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:90%
a different type of thinking.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius being the
universal concepts.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Libra being making the
balance between two thoughts,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:90%
two ideas, or two people.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And Gemini being the dance
of constant interaction.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.740 align:middle line:90%
