00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.980 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: As we explored
in a previous segment,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
the constellations were
indeed an important part

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.955 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient's culture.

00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But what made them
important to astrology

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle line:84%
are the movements
of the Sun and Moon,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as five little
points of light.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:84%
All of the other
stars in the night sky

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:84%
seem fixed in their
positions night after night.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.030 align:middle line:84%
However, these seven heavenly
bodies wandered back and forth

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.450 align:middle line:90%
through the zodiac.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
This caught the
attention and curiosity

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient astronomers.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:84%
Those moving points of light
were called "wanderers"

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
or we now call
them, the planets.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:84%
As they watched the wanderers,
they noticed that the movements

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:90%
were predictable.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
When one point moved, another
moved a little bit more

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and another moved a little less.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.070 align:middle line:84%
These movements
were so precise you

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
can almost think of
them as years turning

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:90%
in an intricate cosmic clock.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the ancient
astronomers began

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
keeping records of these
movements through the zodiac.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
As they recorded
these movements,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
they noticed correlations
with earthly events

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and the personalities
of people born

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:90%
at certain times of the year.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the movements
of these points of light.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
had divine influence
over the events

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
of the world and the
people who inhabited it.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was believed that
these lights must be the gods

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:90%
or vice regents of the gods.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Thus, they were named
after the supreme deities

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
of their religions and
ascribed with the attributes

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:90%
of those gods.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%
The Sun is the great identifier.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It illuminates the
darkness and shadows,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:90%
making everything known.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
As it is lord of
the sky, so, too,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
does it lord over
wealth, royalty,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.336 align:middle line:84%
and the vital force which brings
forth health and strength.

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:10%
Lighting the night sky but
not dispelling the shadows,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:10%
the Moon highlights emotions,
dreams, and aspirations.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:10%
Like the tides rise and
fall, so, too, do emotions.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.756 align:middle line:84%
In the depths of the mind
with memory and dreams,

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:90%
we find the light of the Moon.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.120 align:middle line:84%
The winged messenger,
Mercury, never

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
strays far from the majesty of
the gods, as seen in the Sun.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:10%
Mercury represents all
things of the conscious mind,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:10%
communication,
awareness, cognition,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:10%
and how we express ourselves.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:10%
Love, passion, and
pleasure are the domains

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:10%
of the great goddess Venus.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Her dominion is found
represented in the movements

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.410 align:middle line:90%
of the planet, Venus.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Bringing her feminine
energy into each

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.860 align:middle line:84%
of the constellations,
she accentuates

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
the finer things in life and
indulgence in the senses.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:10%
The great god of
war, Mars, boldly

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:10%
steps forward to
exemplify action,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:10%
energy, drive, and passion.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:84%
In his pursuits of
victory, we find attributes

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:90%
of ambition and completion.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:10%
Never mistake the aggression
of Mars or the bluntness.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Looming large is the great
god of gods, Jupiter.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Ruling over religion
and philosophy,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:10%
Jupiter's clear-minded
intellect brings

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.005 align:middle line:10%
understanding to spirituality,
politics, ethics, and morality.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:10%
Luck and prosperity are
fortunate companions

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:10%
for this seeker of truth.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:10%


00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:10%
The last of these planets
brings limitations,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:10%
lessons, and discipline.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the old god of
time and father of Jupiter.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
As the authority
and a mentor, Saturn

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.230 align:middle line:84%
governs tradition, perseverance,
the passage of time,

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and the orderliness
of all things.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Instead of praying
to these gods,

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
the ancient astronomers
studied their movements

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
across the heavens and
intensified their studies

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
of the events on Earth
and the personalities

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%
of their great leaders.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.804 align:middle line:10%
Soon, they understood how
the movements of the heavens

00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:53.752 align:middle line:10%
correlated with earthly
dealings and could make

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:10%
predictions of events to come.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:84%
All that happens above
also happens below.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Now that you know of the
constellations and the planets,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to
put it all together

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.405 align:middle line:84%
and try to make sense
of the clockwork cosmos

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
of which each one of us
plays an integral part.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
In part three, we
will explore how

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
the movements of the
heavens are connected

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:90%
with the events on Earth.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:90%
