00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.940 align:middle line:10%
RICK LEVINE: When the ancients
watched the movement of the sun

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:10%
and the moon and the
wanderers or the planet's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:10%
through the nighttime sky,
they were particularly

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
fascinated with the
one particular cycle

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.820 align:middle line:10%
because it was an aberration.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.020 align:middle line:10%
It was it was different
than all the other cycles.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:10%
And the cycle that
we're referring to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.540 align:middle line:10%
is the cycle of eclipses.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And eclipses are
an amazing event.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Even in these modern times
when we know what they are,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
seeing a total solar
eclipse is something

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
that one would remember
for the rest of one's life.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
The mechanics behind eclipses
have to do with a point

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:84%
that astrologers map into
a horoscope or chart.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And this point, or
these two points,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
are called the
Nodes of the Moon.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The Nodes of the Moon,
or the Moon's Nodes--

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes referred to as the
North Node and the South Node,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:84%
where the North Node and
South Node of the moon.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
These points are not planets.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
They are not physical.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet they are of
extraordinary importance,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
not only in the cycle of
eclipses, but in the way

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:90%
we live our individual lives.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
The moon goes around the Earth
in its orbit once a month.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:84%
The Earth, meanwhile, is going
around the Sun in its orbit.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
These two orbits are
not on the same plane.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
The orbits are tilted
to one another,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and so the Moon's
orbit around the Earth

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
intersects the plane of the
Earth's orbit around the sun.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Think of it almost as two
Frisbees that are together.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
That are cut in a spot and
pushed into each other.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
And there's a basic
law, an axiom,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
of geometry that says when
two planes intersect, they

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.390 align:middle line:90%
intersect in a straight line.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
The plane, the changing
plane of the Moon's orbit

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth and
the plane of the orbit

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Earth around the Sun intersect
to create a straight line.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And that straight
line is notated

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
by what we call the North Node,
or Ascending Node of the Moon,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and the South or Descending
Node of the Moon.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
The Nodes of the
Moon are the places

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
where the Moon's orbit
intersects the Earth's

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%
orbit around the Sun.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It's such a significant
point that in Hindu

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
or Vedic eastern astrology
they don't create,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
they don't give the
Nodes a lesser position

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
like we do here in the West.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra sometimes refers
to the suffering in the West

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
based upon the superstition
of materialism.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
In Vedic astrology, they simply
refer to the Moon's Nodes

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:90%
as shadow planets.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not less than just
because we cannot perceive

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:90%
them with our five senses.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So what do the Nodes of
the Moon represent and how

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
do we apply them in our lives?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Moon's Nodes,
because they're not physical,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
do not have physical
manifestation

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
like planets and signs do
in our lives and our bodies.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.140 align:middle line:84%
The Nodes of the
Moon are associated

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
with the path of the soul.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You try to put your
finger on them,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing there.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that Nodes
can be considered

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to be related to
past lives, if that's

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:90%
something that you believe in.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
If not, you can relate
to your genetic coding.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:84%
You can relate it even
to your earlier lives

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:90%
in this particular body.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that the Nodes refer
to the trajectory of the soul

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
through this incarnation
in three dimensions.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
The Eastern astrological
tradition looks at the Nodes

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:90%
as negative.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:90%
They're not good.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting because
in the Eastern tradition,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
the three dimensional world is
considered to be an allusion.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And so anything that attaches
us to three dimensions, anything

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that attaches us
to the physicality

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.930 align:middle line:90%
would be viewed as a trap.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
However, we Westerners place
value judgments on the North

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Node versus the South Node.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, the
North Node is simply

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
the point on the
intersection of the Moon's

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.170 align:middle line:84%
orbit around the Earth and the
Earth's orbit around the Sun.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the point where
the Moon is in its orbit

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
coming up above the horizon.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And the South Node is where
it's dipping back down

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:90%
beneath through the horizon.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So we Westerners give the
North Node a value judgment--

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'm overstating
this-- of good,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and the South Node as a
value judgment of bad.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite that simple,
but there's a directionality

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:90%
to this journey of the soul.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The South Node is
where we come from.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
The North Node is
where we're heading to.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
The South Node may be considered
our past lives and the North

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Node considered, perhaps,
this life or even

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
our future incarnations.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The South Node is considered
to be what we've done.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the things in our life that
we're so good at-- whether it

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
be in this lifetime or in
others-- we're so good at it

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that when things get tough
here and now, we snap back

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:90%
and we do that.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
The South Node, in Western
astrology is the trap.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
The North Node is
the aspiration.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:90%
It's the work.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's the Dharma that we need to
do to get to where we're going.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
To the North Node has the
direction of the future.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The South Node has the
direction of the past.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So by knowing one's Nodes
one can get a sense--

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and this is separate
from the life

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.920 align:middle line:84%
that we live, the who we are,
the Sun, the how we feel.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The Moon, the how we
think, the Mercury.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
The what we like, the Venus.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
The how we appear,
the rising side.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
The Moon's Nodes
are beyond all this.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They are about our journey on
this planet, in this lifetime.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It's clues to what
we hope to accomplish

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and how we hope to make our
soul a better soul by the time

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:90%
we get to leave.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:90%
