00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.820 align:middle line:10%
It appears that the moon,
unlike all the other planets,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:10%
looks very different at
different times of the year.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.740 align:middle line:10%
The thing is that the
moon is about a 29

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:10%
day cycle around the Earth.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:10%
And what that means is that over
that period of approximately

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
four weeks, the
moon's light changes

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:10%
because when the moon is on
the same side of the Earth

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:10%
as the sun we don't see it.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It's vanished.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
It's disappeared into the
brilliance of the sun.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But when the moon is on the far
side of the Earth from the sun

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.790 align:middle line:84%
then it's reflecting
all of the sun's light,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's when we
see a full moon.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The full moon is the moon
on one side of the Earth,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and the new moon is
when the moon comes

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:90%
between the Earth and the sun.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to study
a lot of astrology

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
to observe the behavior
of your friends

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
and-- just people driving
at the time of a new moon

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:90%
versus a full moon.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
The moon reflects
the light of the sun.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Astrologically, the
sun is consciousness.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:90%
It's our awareness.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the fuel that fires
the center of our being.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
The moon is our emotions
or our feelings,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's how we respond
to the light of the sun.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, looking at
an astrology chart one

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
looks at the moon
to see how we embody

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
or respond to the sun sign
which is the "who we are."

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
The moon is "how we feel."

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So at the full moon we tend to
feel more of the sun's energy

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And people born at a full moon
tend to live life at full tilt.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:90%
They feel things more fully.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And at a full moon, it's
absolutely documented

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
that emergency rooms
swell with reports

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
of-- or with cases of
things that happened--

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:90%
whether they're accidents.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Policemen that I
know don't like it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
when a full moon falls on
a Friday or Saturday night

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and especially if that full
moon falls on a holiday weekend

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
because the full moon
does make us crazy.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the origin of
the old myth of werewolves.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We do not grow hair
and howl at the moon

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
although I'm sure that
many of you either have

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
or know someone who's gone out
in howling at the full moon.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that we
feel things more fully.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And here's one other
interesting observation--

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and that is there's a thing in
science called surface tension.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
If you take a needle--a
pin-- you can float

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:90%
it on the surface of water.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And what prevents that
heavier than water

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
needle from sinking to the
bottom is the water beads up.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:90%
It's called surface tension.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Surface tension changes from
the new moon to the full moon.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Doctors know that at a
full moon, we bleed easier.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
We bleed more than
at a new moon--

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that the surface tension
is greater at a new moon

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.890 align:middle line:90%
than at a full moon.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:90%
The energy seems to flow more.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So without even
being an astrologer,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
just paying
attention to the days

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
before the full
moon-- watching it,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
realizing that your dreams
are going to be richer.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up in the
morning, your dreams

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
won't necessarily
end and that perhaps

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:90%
you tend to be more emotional.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
You tend, perhaps, to feel
premenstrual whether you're

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
a man or a woman
because the word menses

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
really means "of the moon."

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
However, at the new moon-- this
is the time to plant seeds.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
The new moon is when our minds
are more clear-- their clearer.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Our dreams are not as colorful.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Our emotions are not as full.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that the cycle
of the moon around the Earth

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
is different than the cycle of
the Earth around the sun which

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
means that in one calendar year,
there is a new moon in each

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:90%
of the 12 signs.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, once
a "moonth," the moon

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
comes between the
Earth and the sun,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and it does it in each of
the 12 signs in the zodiac.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if it's
the Aries time of year

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's a new moon,
it's a new moon in Aries.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:84%
However, if it's a full moon
in the spring in Aries time

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
then the moon is going to be in
the opposite sign, Libra, which

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
means that there are
12 signs of the zodiac,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and the moon is new and full
in each of those 12 signs.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
By knowing your own sign,
and paying attention

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
to when the new moon
occurs in your sign,

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:84%
or six months later around
the time of your half birthday

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:84%
when the full moon occurs in
your sign-- these are marks.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
These are points.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They're points on
your yearly calendar

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with when is
the best time for you to start

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
new ventures and
when is the best time

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to bring those
ventures into fruition.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.834 align:middle line:90%
