00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.950 align:middle line:10%
The astrological
Earth signs are

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.219 align:middle line:10%
Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.000 align:middle line:10%
The element of Earth is,
as one might suspect,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:10%
being down to earth.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Earth signs tend to have
their feet on the ground.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Earth signs are practical.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:84%
In the [INAUDIBLE]
modality of thinking,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Earth signs are
associated with sensation.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a direct of the senses
that happen with Earth signs,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
because sensing things directly
is what makes them real,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and Earth is real.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about the three
dimensional world we live in.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
action, which is fire.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the feelings
that we have, which is water,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's not about the
intellect, which is air.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Earth is that which we
can see or we can feel

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or we can think about or we
can actually engage directly.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:90%
The first Earth sign is Taurus.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Taurus is a fixed Earth sign.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with
holding one's position.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:10%
The outstanding
quality about Taurus

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:10%
is that when it's holding
a position, it's immovable.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I always think of Taurus
as Newton's third law--

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
an object at rest tends to stay
at rest and an object in motion

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:90%
tends to stay in motion.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Think of the bull
that is charging.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy to stop it.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But think of the bull
that isn't going anywhere.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Trying to get it to move
is really difficult.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And while we're on the
image of the bovines,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
think of the cows coming back
to the barn in the evening

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:90%
to be milked.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the second quality
of the fixed energy of Taurus

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is their unstoppable
determination.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
That cow is going to
get back to the barn.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is going
to get in its way.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is going to stop it.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Taurus as a fixed
Earth sign is known

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
to be stubborn, is known to
be able to hold the position

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:90%
and be really reliable.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the Earth
sign or the Taurus people

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that you know, you
might consider them

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
amongst the most dependable
people in the zodiac.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:90%
The second Earth sign is Virgo.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Virgo is the mutable or
changeable Earn sign.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And as such, it's really the
lightest of the Earth signs.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the least earthy
of the Earth signs.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And although it does have to
do with the process of thinking

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, it's not
just about thinking

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
philosophical thoughts
and ideas that

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
have no practical
use, because all

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:90%
the Earth signs are practical.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Virgo has to do with
ideas or thoughts

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.560 align:middle line:90%
or facts that can be applied.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:90%
Virgo is about usefulness.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
The idea of Virgo is how do
I make use of what I have.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even in
the body, the colon,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
which is the part that's
associated with Virgo,

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
its singular function
is to separate

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:84%
that which can be used by the
body from that which can't.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So Virgo as a mutable Earth
sign is practical enough,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's an Earth sign,
to use the facts that it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
has, but it also is
constantly analyzing the facts

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about how to use
them and what it needs to know

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and what it needs to do in
order to get to the place

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:84%
that it's going based
upon what is true.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The image of Virgo holding
the Virgin or the maiden

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
holding the wheat and
separating the wheat

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
from the stalks or
the chaff-- this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:90%
is really what Virgo is about.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
As an Earth sign, it's
about the binary function.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
This is OK.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
That's not OK.
That's OK.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:90%
That's not OK.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the sorting function
to determine what is useful.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:84%
The third Earth sign is
the sign of Capricorn.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And Capricorn is the
cardinal Earth sign.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn basically
has movement.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
Earth, it has movement.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
The cardinal signs are
the season starting signs.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They're the signs
that initiate energy.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
As the mountain goat has
movement to climb the mountain,

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
every Capricorn is wired for
ambition to get to the top

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:90%
of their local mountain.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn aspires towards
vertical ascendancy.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And as such, Capricorns
are ambitious.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's the practicality
that comes to the forefront,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
because a Capricorn, a mountain
goat, will never miss step.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The mountain goats that
live on the edge of cliffs

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and scamper up the
side of a mountain,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
they are exhibiting
the Earth quality

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of having their feet
firmly on the ground

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
even though it looks like
they are in movement.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Each of the three Earth
signs shares that idea

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
of practicality, but they
each do it in a different way

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
depending upon whether it's
initiating energy-- energy

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
like the Capricorn scampering
up the side of a cliff,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Virgo, the
mutable, changeable thinking

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
about how it's going
to apply the energy,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
or the Taurus, that's
absolutely firmly holding

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:90%
the position no matter what.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:43.367 align:middle line:90%
