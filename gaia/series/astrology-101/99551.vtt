[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.560 align:middle line:10%
The primary tool of the
astrologer is the horoscope.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.600 align:middle line:10%
Now when I use the
word horoscope,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm not referring to the daily
horoscope columns of which

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.980 align:middle line:10%
I've been writing one
every day for the past 13

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:10%
years of my life.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to the tool
that astrologers use sometimes

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:90%
referred to as the chart.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:84%
We talk about our
charts and the chart

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:84%
is a map, an accurate and
graphical representation

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
of where the sun, moon, Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Uranus, Neptune, Pluto,
where all these planets are

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and other points all
mapped against the horizon

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
from the day, and time, and
place that we were born.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
The word horoscope is actually
of the same derivation

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
as the word telescope
or microscope.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
"Scope" comes from a Greek
word, skopos, to view

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:90%
or to have a perspective of.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It's to see.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:90%
The word "horo" means hour.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
The word horoscope is
the view of an hour.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like a telescope
is the view of something

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:84%
far away, tele-far, or
micros, tiny-- a microscope

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:84%
is the view of something
tiny-- a horoscope

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.310 align:middle line:84%
is a piece of technology that
allows us to see the hour.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It's an hour marker.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough, in
ancient Greek astrology

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
your horoscope was considered
to be the last visible planet

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.180 align:middle line:84%
or sign on the eastern horizon
at the time that you were born.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they didn't
have the sophisticated computer

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
technology and rendering
technologies that we have,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
so to them the horoscope
was the hour marker.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
It was your rising
sign or the sign that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:90%
was on the eastern horizon.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, we astrologers
take a mixture of each

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
of the planets with
respect to the horizon

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and we put this all together
to get a sense of how

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
the whole picture hums and
it's the individual hum that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:90%
makes us individual.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Even though there are only
12 signs in the Zodiac,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
there are as many
individual horoscopes

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:84%
as there are individual
people on the planet.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.734 align:middle line:90%
