00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.740 align:middle line:10%
As an astrologer, I've
learned that I can instill fear

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:10%
into most people by simply
using the magic of two words--

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.680 align:middle line:10%
Mercury retrograde.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
It's not that bad.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:10%
We have a huge misunderstanding
about what mercury

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:10%
retrograde is and how it works.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The mechanics, first
of all, are simple.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And we all should know
it because there's

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.200 align:middle line:84%
nothing mysterious about
Mercury going retrograde.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what happens is
that Mercury is a planet

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:90%
that's going around the sun.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're on earth,
further away from the sun,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
so we're watching Mercury
go around the sun.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And as mercury goes around
the sun three times a year,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
it catches up to Earth on
its journey around the sun.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And as it catches up to
Earth, it becomes closer.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:90%
It gets closer to Earth.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And as it does, we
lose perspective.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that most of us
have had the experience

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.300 align:middle line:84%
of being in a train and seeing a
train on the tracks next to us.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And the train is so close
that we lose perspective.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And although we're going faster
than the train next to us,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
it actually appears, as we
look through the windows,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that the train, or subway
car, or the car next to us,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:84%
it appears like it's
going backwards.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually
going backwards.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's just going
forward less fast.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So with Mercury
retrograde, we're

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:84%
not really talking about the
planets moving backwards.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
We know that-- that they
don't move backwards.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But if we map them
against the night sky,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and as the ancients did, we
see that they appear to move

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:90%
backwards against the zodiac.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
The truth of the
matter is that when

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
a planet is closer to
Earth in its normal cycle,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:90%
its signal gets stronger.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you were talking
to someone nearby versus yelling

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
at someone who is far
away, versus yelling

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
at someone who is so far
away they couldn't hear you,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:90%
distance matters.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
When Mercury gets close to
Earth, three times a year,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
for about three weeks at a
time, it turns retrograde.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens is that the
archetypal energy of Mercury

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
is amped up.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So what's the archetype
of energy of Mercury?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Mercury is the messenger planet.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the winged messenger
that delivers information.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the planet
of thinking, of thought.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Mercury is the planet of facts.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the planet of
sending and receiving data.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're just
doing it through static

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's noise, or whether
we're doing it through language,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Mercury always has to
do with information

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:90%
being sent and received.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word
"merchandise" or "mercantile"

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
comes from Mercury because
even though there's

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
physical substance,
there's still something.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
There's information
being exchanged.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
Mercury gets closer to Earth

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
is that the traffic of
exchange becomes noisier.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Think of each individual
person as their own being

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
with communication wires, and
lines, and bridges, and roads,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
and freeways that
connect each of us

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:90%
to everyone else in our world.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, usually, those
roads have traffic

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:90%
that we're familiar with.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But three times a year,
we enter a traffic jam.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And that traffic jam can
make that traffic so intense

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
that roads basically
build up traffic

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and the cars can't move, that
bridges become so weighted

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
under the traffic
that they can actually

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:90%
fall apart under the pressure.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Wires can fray because
the noise is so great.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is true.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
When Mercury is retrograde,
computers often go awry.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:84%
It is true that we can
misunderstand someone.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
We can get directions and
make a left-hand turn instead

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of a right-hand turn,
and find ourselves

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:90%
30 miles out of the way.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
We can even enter something
incorrectly on a GPS,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
think we're going
to the right place,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and end up at the wrong place.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is that
Mercury retrograde is not bad.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
What's bad is when we act
without thinking, when

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the information
becomes so intense

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and everything
becomes so speeded up,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
we jump to conclusions,
we say things wrong.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.473 align:middle line:84%
The practice for retrograde
Mercury is to put the R-E

00:04:44.473 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:84%
letters, the "re-"
word, in front

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:90%
of anything that you're doing.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Rethink, reconsider,
reevaluate, re-listen,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
listen again-- do whatever it
is again so that you don't jump

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to the erroneous
conclusion, so that you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:90%
don't make the wrong turn.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It has been said, and I've heard
this even from astrologers,

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
don't ever sign a contract
when Mercury is retrograde.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't go on trips.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Look, Mercury is retrograde for
a total of nine weeks a year,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and life doesn't stop during
those periods of time.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The key to succeeding to
surviving Mercury retrograde

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is to pay attention to the
details, and to take the time

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:90%
and read the fine print.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who is
out looking for a car who

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
decided, on a
Mercury retrograde,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.664 align:middle line:90%
that he was going to buy a car.

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going
to go out looking.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And the first afternoon
he went out looking,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
he came across a purple
little sports car,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
fell in love with
it, and bought it.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And it took him
about a week or so

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
to realize it was a
pretty stupid thing

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:90%
to do because he had dogs.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:90%
And it was like an impulse.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And you see, the thing is
that if you go out and buy

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
a computer, or buy a
car, or sign a contract

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and don't take the time to
go over all the fine print--

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
you see, because when
Mercury is retrograde,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
it's covering territory in the
sky where it's already been.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we feel a
great sense of urgency

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that if I don't buy that car
today, I'll miss the chance.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
That car won't be
there tomorrow.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So again, the practice
with Mercury retrograde

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:90%
is slow down.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Remember you have more
time than you think,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that Mercury retrogrades,
and turns direct, and turns

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:90%
retrograde, and turns direct.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you
follow the flow

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and tie up those loose
ends the best you can,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
you won't fall into the
abyss of the problem

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:90%
of Mercury retrograde.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.710 align:middle line:90%
