00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.480 align:middle line:84%
KAEDRICH OLSEN: AS you look
upon the night sky spread out

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
across the vast
curtain of night,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.140 align:middle line:84%
you will find a myriad
points of light,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:84%
each of them with a sun in their
own right, and many of them

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
with planets orbiting
them, just like our own.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
There are so many of these
points of light and even more

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:84%
undiscovered worlds, it is
easy to get lost in it all,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:84%
leaving you to
contemplate your place

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:90%
in the vast scheme of things.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It is easy to feel small
and insignificant amidst

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
the infinite expanse of
the universe stretched out

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
before you, but it is
important that know

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that you are an intricate
part of the workings

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:90%
of this great cosmos.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years ago, the
night sky appeared almost

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:90%
exactly as it does today.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And just like you, when
the ancient astronomers

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.973 align:middle line:84%
peered upon the infinite
vastness of night,

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
they too contemplated
the meaning

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of it all and their place in
the vast scheme of things.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:84%
As they watched the night sky,
their imaginations ran wild,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and images formed
in their minds.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Connecting the dots between
the myriad points of light,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.690 align:middle line:84%
they discovered their
heroes and legends

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.610 align:middle line:90%
stretched out before them.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
The night sky became
an eternal theater,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.717 align:middle line:84%
where great heroes and
mythical beasts played out

00:01:20.717 --> 00:01:23.212 align:middle line:90%
the greatest epics of all time.

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:26.890 align:middle line:84%
These great images became
known as constellations.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:84%
12 of these constellations
became the best known

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and the most significant
to astrology.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:10%
These are called the zodiac.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The first is Aries, the ram
bolting into the night sky.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Just like the ram, Aries
represents aggressive will,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
assertiveness, leadership, and
the drive to compete and win,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.225 align:middle line:84%
strong personality,
and a healthy ego.

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Next, Taurus the bull
represents love of reward,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
spoils from victory, physical
pleasures, and material goods.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:10%
Excess is adored
and the good in life

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:10%
is primary focus-- independence
and perseverance with an eye

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:10%
focused on the goal.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Third, we find the
twins, Castor and Pollux.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Gemini tries to find the two
sides for every situation.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
With this comes a sense of the
practical and the intellectual.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
With that, we find
curiosity and communication,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
clear mindedness and sharing.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Next, Cancer is
the great crab that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:84%
crawls across the night sky,
carrying its home on its back.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the love
of home and family,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
a sense of nurturing others
and upholding traditions.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.714 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, it has a tenacity
to protect home and family,

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
like the hardened shell.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.322 align:middle line:84%
The light of the
sun figuratively

00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
shines through the lion, as
Leo lights up the night sky.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Ambition, strength,
and creativity all

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
lead to the personal
magnetism that Leo represents.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.919 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the lion is emblazoned
with warmth and enthusiastic

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:90%
idealism.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Following in the
footsteps of Leo's pride

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:90%
is the exacting nature of Virgo.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
It represents the
punctual and the precise.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Attention to detail is
an exacting standard

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:90%
to be maintained.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.939 align:middle line:84%
Sensibility and practicality
are projected by the ever

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:90%
watching eyes of Virgo.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Bringing forth
balance to the zodiac

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.886 align:middle line:90%
are the great scales of Libra.

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
This balance is found
in equal partnerships,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:90%
harmony, and justice.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Charm and intellect
are the tools

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
of the cunning Libra,
who seeks equilibrium,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.856 align:middle line:90%
between conflicting forces.

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:45.435 align:middle line:84%
The intensity builds as a
great scorpion in the sky

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:90%
lashes its tail.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.005 align:middle line:84%
Scorpio is a master
of its own destiny

00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
when determination,
passion, and curiosity

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:90%
are its greatest motivators.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
To that end, Scorpio
will never quit

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:90%
or back down in any endeavor.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Sagittarius is the great
centaur archer of the sky.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Centaurs were once considered
to be great intellectuals.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:10%
And this pursuit
of understanding

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:10%
is represented by Sagittarius.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
The archer forever aims
for greater knowledge

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
and understanding,
often taking the pursuit

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:90%
to exaggerated means.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.436 align:middle line:84%
Climbing to the heights of
the mountain and in life,

00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
the great goat of
Capricorn seeks

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
the pinnacle while maintaining
a strong sense of pragmatism.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
With industriousness,
efficiency, and organization,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the Capricorn works
hard towards its goals,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.089 align:middle line:90%
and usually succeeds.

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The waters run forth from
the water bearer, Aquarius.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
The world becomes a better
place as the progressive visions

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and humanitarian
efforts flow to all.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
The intellect and
vision of Aquarius

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
become the determination for
a better place for everyone.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Swimming through
the Aquarian waters,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:90%
we find the fish of Pisces.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Charitable and compassionate,
the imagination of Pisces

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:84%
helps to gently guide others
through the rough waters

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it is through
introspection that the fishes

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:84%
find the intuition which
guides their pursuits.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:84%
The great cosmic theater
is only the beginning

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the connection
between cosmic cycles

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:90%
and the events on Earth.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Deeper insight came
as the ancients

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
learned to track movements
of tiny points wandering back

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and forth across the night sky
and discovered their influences

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:90%
upon the world.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We will explore what
these ancient astronomers

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
knew about these wanderers
in our next segment.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.967 align:middle line:90%
