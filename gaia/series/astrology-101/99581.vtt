KAEDRICH OLSEN: As the ancient
astronomers track the movements

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.510 align:middle line:10%
of the great cosmic years
in our clockwork universe,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.724 align:middle line:10%
they learn how they could
determine the movements

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:17.920 align:middle line:10%
of the smaller gears on earth.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Everything above and
below move together

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:90%
with intricate precision.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Every individual part is
vitally important to the whole.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.080 align:middle line:90%
This is where you come in.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.340 align:middle line:84%
You are here under
the stars wondering

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:84%
what your purpose is simply
because you have a purpose.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You are an important
part of all that

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
is, all that was, an
all that ever will be

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.966 align:middle line:90%
even if you do not yet see it.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was 10,000
years ago in distant lands

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
or right here and now,
each and every one of us

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is an important part of
the intricate machinery

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmos.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
To understand the cosmic
influences on our lives

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and how we influence
the cosmos, we

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
can look to the
movements of the heavens

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to help us determine
the course of life.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:84%
One such way is
to take a snapshot

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:84%
of the locations of the planets
at the moment you were born.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
This is called the natal
chart and it can give you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
great insight into
your purpose and place

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:90%
in the vast scheme of it all.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.260 align:middle line:84%
To begin, look at where your
sun was when you are born.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the identifier
of your personality

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and helps to guide
the influences

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:90%
from the other planets.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:84%
If your sun is in
Aries, you will

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
have a tendency to be bold
and forthcoming in your life.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:10%
If your sun is in Taurus,
you will look for the gains

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
from the competition and
put them to practical use.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Next, look at the sign
that was on the horizon

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:90%
when you were born.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:84%
This is called the rising
sign and it is how you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:90%
present yourself to the world.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
For some, this is
in stark contrast

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:90%
to their solar personality.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Others find it
completely complementary.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Even though your
sun may be in Aries,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:84%
you may have a
rising sign in Libra

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
that will influence
you to balance

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
your ambitions with the
needs of those in your life.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Your sun may be in Taurus and if
your rising sign is in Scorpio,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:84%
then you will pursue your goals
with passion and tenacity.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:84%
As you look to the other planets
to determine what sign they are

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
in, weigh them with what
you know of your sun

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:90%
and your rising sign.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
No planet works independent
from the others.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.625 align:middle line:84%
You are complete
in and of yourself

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and the heavens are
just as complete.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Thus, a Mercury in
Aquarius will strengthen

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts and
communication with dealings

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.810 align:middle line:90%
of a better world.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Your sun and rising sign will
indicate how those thoughts

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:90%
will aid in your ambitions.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.215 align:middle line:84%
A Jupiter in Capricorn
will influence

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
you to rise to the pinnacle
of your chosen profession.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Preferably, you will find a
professional that works well

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:90%
with your sun and rising sign.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
We have only just begun to
scratch the surface of what

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
astrology has to teach us.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
For the thousands of years
that astrology has been around,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
countless astronomers
have recorded

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.634 align:middle line:84%
their heavenly observations
and earthly correlations.

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:84%
They have also found
really different ways

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of examining the
placement of the planets

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:90%
at the time of your birth.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So as you gaze
upon the night sky,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
wondering what your purpose
is and what it all means,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.935 align:middle line:84%
it is good to know that you
are just as important as each

00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:20.030 align:middle line:84%
of the wanderers trekking
through the constellations

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%
night after night.
