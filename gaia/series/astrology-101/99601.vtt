00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:10%
The system of astrology divides
an entire cycle, a whole cycle,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.090 align:middle line:10%
into various parts.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:10%
With the zodiac, we divide
the circle into 12 parts.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:84%
There are 12 signs
to the zodiac.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.300 align:middle line:84%
However, we can
divide the zodiac up

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
into four different segments,
which are called the elements--

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:90%
fire, earth, air, and water.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Each sign is a member of
one of these four elements.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, these elements--
fire, earth, air, and water--

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:10%
date back to the
Greek period, where

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:10%
this was used to understand
the nature of each individual.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was based upon a concept
of different bodies, body

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And "humors" was the
word that the Greeks used

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
to define these four types.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung, the famous
20th century astrologer,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
developed an astrology that
we call Jungian astrology

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
but he called
analytical psychology,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%
the psychology of four types.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
He based his psychology on the
Greek understanding of the four

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
elements-- fire,
earth, air, and water--

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.870 align:middle line:84%
where in the Jungian concept,
fire was direct action, doing.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Earth was practical, was
down-to-earth sensing.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Air was thinking,
up in the intellect.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And water was
emoting or feeling.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It is these four elements that
we astrologers use when talking

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:90%
about each of the 12 signs.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.667 align:middle line:90%
