00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.060 align:middle line:10%
Anyone who hangs out
in an astrological crowd

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:10%
knows something about the
infamous Saturn return.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:10%
Saturn returns in the
sky to where it was

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
about every 29 and 1/2 years.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Earth goes
around the sun once every year,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Saturn goes around the sun,
and therefore goes around

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
the zodiac, once every
29 and 1/2 years.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We can round it off to 30
years, but it's actually

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:90%
about 29 and 1/2 years.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
What that means is
that Saturn moves

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
through each and every sign of
the zodiac in 29 and 1/2 years.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like we celebrate our
birthday when the sun returns

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to where it was when we were
born-- meaning that the Earth

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:84%
actually has made one complete
journey around the sun--

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
just as we celebrate
our annual solar return,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
astrologers make
note of the Saturn

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:84%
return, which is
like our birthday

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:90%
if we were living on Saturn.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It happens to everyone
around age 29 and 1/2.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And by calculating an exact
horoscope chart or natal

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
or birth chart, one can
determine the exact day or week

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that Saturn returned
or returns to where

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:90%
it was when you were born.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Now because the Earth
is moving around

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:84%
inside the orbit of Saturn
moving way out here,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
what happens is that outer
planets, just like Mercury,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:90%
look like they go retrograde.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And as such, a Saturn return
can happen in one day,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:84%
or Saturn can retrograde
back over that same point,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and someone's Saturn
return can be stretched

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:84%
out for weeks or months or
even up to about eight or nine

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
months.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Here's the deal.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one-day event, ever.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
As we approach our Saturn return
in our 28th and 29th year,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
we begin feeling the
pressure of Saturn.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the
planet of authority.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the
planet of maturity.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is Father Time.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is the planet of old age.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
In Greek, Saturn was
Chronos, the keeper of time.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is the grim reaper.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It's you get what you deserve.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But you don't always
deserve what's bad.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But Saturn gets a bad rap
because so much-- so many of us

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
don't do the hard work
that we need to do

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:90%
to stay on Saturn's good side.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So for the year or so coming
into the Saturn return,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:84%
around 28 and into
our 29th year,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
we spend more and more time
feeling Saturn's pressure

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.615 align:middle line:90%
to do what we should do.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course we don't
know what we should do,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:84%
but we feel the
pressure to do it.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
So we spend more
time in our days

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and in our nights
looking back and saying,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
where have I been, what have I
done, over my first 28 years?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:90%
What's worked in life?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:90%
What hasn't worked?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Where do I want to go?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:90%
What do I want to do?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
What do I want to
be when I grow up?

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Because Saturn is
all about growing up.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And the gate of the Saturn
return is the gate of maturity.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the gate of growing up.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Most astrologers
know that age 21

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
is not the time of
becoming an adult.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, it is for legal reasons.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that
astrologically, at 28, 29, 30,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
once you go through your Saturn
return, then you're a grown up.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, we have
a phrase that we say.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
That we say never trust anyone
over 30 when you're young.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you're over
30, doesn't matter

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
how cool or wonderful
or mature someone

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
is in their teens or 20s,
they're not yet grown up.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
That is the gate of
the Saturn return.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that there is
no other time in our lives,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
outside of the Saturn
return, when free will is

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:90%
operating so strongly.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Now we may not know
this at the time,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but if you're in your 30s
or 40s or 50s or more,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
look back to that period of life
when you were 28, 29, and 30,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and make a list of the things
that you did or didn't do.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Make a list of the
changes that occurred.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And usually they include getting
married, getting divorced,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:84%
buying a home, selling a
home, changing jobs, changing

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:90%
careers, going back to school.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:90%
These big lifetime change moves.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Because in the years coming
up to the Saturn return,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
it's like you're
climbing a mountain.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And as mountain climbers
know, sometimes it's

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:84%
the last mile, the last half
mile, the last 20 feet, that

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.550 align:middle line:84%
are the most
difficult. And often,

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
going into our Saturn
returns, we feel the weight

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:90%
of the world on our shoulders.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at that time of
the actual Saturn return

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and the days and weeks after, we
feel exhilarated, because we're

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:90%
now going down the mountain.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that the
direction we choose

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
at the time of being on
the top of the mountain

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.760 align:middle line:84%
will impact us
for years to come.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, often
people in their mid-30s

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:84%
who are bent out
of shape, shall we

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
say, that are having a difficult
time, that are depressed,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
that are in marriages
where they're not happy

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:84%
or in jobs that
they're not happy,

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
often these are people who
stepped down off their Saturn

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
return in a direction
that now they're

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of the woods
and they're going over rivers

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and they've lost the
perspective that we have

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the mountain.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going into
your Saturn return,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
take this time in your
life to think about where

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
you want to be in 30
years, even though we

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:90%
don't normally do that.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And begin to put in
motion the changes

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that will bring about
the you that you

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:90%
want to be in your future.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Now the fact is that Saturn
returns every 30 years to where

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:90%
it was when you were born.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, at about age
57, 58, in that range, Saturn

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:90%
returns for a second time.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And again, we look
back in our lives

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and we think about
what we've done.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
We've lived the bulk
of our life now.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
We've lived our adult years.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to ground it?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to make changes
so that we can live out what

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
may be the third
third of our life,

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
until the third
Saturn return, which

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
occurs roughly around the
age of 85, 86, 87, 88.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And it interestingly corresponds
with the Uranus return.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Uranus is the weird,
eccentric planet that

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:90%
takes 84 years to go around.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And so as we're going into
our third Saturn return,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.570 align:middle line:84%
we're also dealing with the
eccentricities of old age.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But again, the key is, whether
it's your first, second,

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
or third Saturn
return, these are

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
times when, if we pay
attention to where we've been,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
where we are, and
where we are going,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
we can make decisions
that will have

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
greater impact than at
other times in our lives.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:90%
