00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.150 align:middle line:10%
In astrology, we
focus on the movement

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:10%
of the sun and the moon and
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.370 align:middle line:10%
Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune, and Pluto,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:10%
all from Earth's point of view.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:10%
And we map these points
against the horizon of Earth.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:10%
However, if only the
universe was as simple

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:10%
as a mapping a handful
of points on a chart,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:10%
this would be a much
different world than it is.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the
matter is the universe

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
is filled with mystery.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And we even have that
symbol, that metaphor,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:84%
represented
astrologically by the fact

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that once one delves
into astrology

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and begins to learn the
meanings of the various planets

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in the various signs, one
is confronted with the fact

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that there are other
objects up there.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
These other objects
also go around the sun,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.630 align:middle line:90%
just like the planets.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when the
first of these objects

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
was discovered in the
19th century, Ceres,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:84%
it was assumed to be a new
planet that was discovered.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And this was big
news in the day,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:90%
the discovery of a new planet.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But then another new
planet was discovered

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
and then another new
planet was discovered.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we had several
of these planets

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that couldn't really be
planets because there

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:90%
were too many of them.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
given a new name

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:90%
and they were called asteroids.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And the asteroid belt
exists in an orbit

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
around the sun between
the orbit of Mars

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:90%
and the orbit of Jupiter.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge,
vast reach of space.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Mars takes less
than a couple of years

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to go around the sun
and Jupiter takes

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:90%
12 years to go around the sun.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And in between Mars and Jupiter
are thousands and thousands

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
objects, some of them

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
large enough to trick us into
thinking that they are planets

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and others small
enough to just be

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
little rocks, little pebbles,
pieces of space gravel.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The weird thing is that these
asteroids, when analyzed

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
by their names and their
orbits and their positions,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:84%
carry just as much
weight as the planets.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the mysterious things

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
about astrology and about the
universe in which we live.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I guess that if one believes
that as above, so below,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
one can't make arbitrary
distinctions between how far

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.030 align:middle line:84%
above and how far
below or how big

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
something needs to be
to have impact on us.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
when we map these points,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
we can develop new nuances
to people's personalities

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and the rhythms of our lives.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, in 1977, Chiron
was discovered.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it was
thought to be a new planet

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and then thought, nope,
maybe it's an asteroid.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And then it was
realized that it was

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.990 align:middle line:84%
not within the asteroid belt.
It couldn't be an asteroid.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was then
discovered that there

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
were many other planetoids,
not asteroids, not comets.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's create a new class of
objects going around the sun,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:90%
said NASA.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are
called the centaurs,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and Chiron is simply the
largest of the centaurs.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, by looking at the
imagery and the mythology

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
of Chiron, we get to
understand better the nature

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.910 align:middle line:90%
of our own individual lives.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
However, we don't
even have to stop

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with these objects going around
the sun at this proximity.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
There are objects being
discovered now that are

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:90%
out past the orbit of Pluto.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as we go further
and further out into space,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
we find that there are places
in the universe out there

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that are black holes and radio
sources and x-ray sources.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And there are clusters of
galaxies and there are galaxies

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and there are all--
phasers and pulsars.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds
of things out there.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's an entire
branch of astrology

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
that only could come into
being in the latter part

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.570 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century called
deep space astrology.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're looking at the
planets that the ancients could

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
see, and that would be
Mercury, Venus, Mars,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter and Saturn, or the
modern planets that include

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Uranus, Neptune, and
Pluto or the asteroids,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
whether they're the four largest
ones or 10,000 more named ones,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:84%
or the centaurs or all these
other things out there,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see that even
with the use of astrology,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
that life cannot be
reduced to just a simple

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:90%
map where we know everything.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:90%
