00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.560 align:middle line:10%
The singularly most
readily observed

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.890 align:middle line:10%
astrological phenomenon
is that of day and night.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:10%
The rotation of the
Earth creates a period

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:10%
of approximately 12 hours
of day and 12 hours of night

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:10%
if you're on the equator.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the closer
you get to the north

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
or south poles, the more this
horizon of light and darkness

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
becomes bent out of shape
by the tilt of the earth

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:90%
based upon the time of the year.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
This daily cycle of light and
dark, which is a diurnal cycle,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
there's two parts
of it each day,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is a basic tenet of astrological
analysis and understanding.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is so important that the
rising sign, which we talked

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
about in an earlier
session, is actually

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the marker of the horizon that
separates light from dark.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The sign that's rising
and the particular point

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.680 align:middle line:84%
on that rising
sign, the ascendant,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:90%
is one point on one side.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the sun rising
at the moment of sunrise,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:90%
the sun is on the ascendant.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Then depending upon
what time of year

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
it is, whether it's 12 hours
later or just a few hours later

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
if you're in the Arctic in
winter or many hours later

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
if it's mid summer, when the
sun is on the Western horizon,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
that marks the descendant.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
The line connecting the
ascendant and descendant

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
create the horizon.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Astrologically, when we look
at a birth chart or horoscope,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
judgments that we make

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is how many planets
are above the horizon,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and how many planets
are below the horizon?

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Because above the horizon,
we have visibility,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, the point that's
highest above the horizon

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:90%
is the midheaven.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:84%
The midheaven is the point
that the sun would be at noon

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:90%
if the sun was really there.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:90%
There is always a midheaven.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Then again, if we're
far north in the winter,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the midheaven can be pretty
close to the horizon.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the midheaven isn't
always directly up above.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that when
planets are above the horizon,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:90%
they are observable.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.920 align:middle line:90%
They are seen.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
They have to do with what
other people can see about us.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
If someone is born
with all their planets

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
above the horizon,
it's like they

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:90%
live their life in a fishbowl.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Everyone sees who they are.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
If someone's born with many
planets or several planets

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
below the horizon,
they've got secrets

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
There's parts of their life
that are more complicated

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and that are more hidden.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
The midheaven in particular,
like the rising sign

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
or the ascendant,
holds particular weight

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
in the interpretation
of someone's chart

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
or in the understanding
of any given

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:90%
moment throughout the day.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
The midheaven, it's almost
like the rising sign

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
is how we appear to
others and it's personal.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The midheaven, the
point up above,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like it's the career point.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It's if you took
everything out of someone's

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
life that was personal and
said, now describe them.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
You would have to say, oh,
that's the person who's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:90%
on the Board of Education.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's the guy that got
committed for such and such

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:90%
so many years ago.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's that
Nobel Prize winner.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's that woman who
is awesome because she

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:90%
climbed this mountain.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.810 align:middle line:84%
You see, but it's not
about anything personal.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The midheaven is how we
stand up in the outer world.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The midheaven, it's
the social point--

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean
social like party--

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
it's like the social reality.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And as such, that someone who is
born with many planets that are

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
close to the midheaven,
those planets

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
determine or at
least influence how

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:90%
that person's career unfolds.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, knowing what
sign you have on the midheaven

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
helps you understand
how you might best

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
utilize your own
energies in your career.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, if someone had a
fire sign on their midheaven,

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
this might be someone
who had to be active

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
in their line of work, whereas
someone who had a water

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
sign on their midheaven might be
more indicative of someone who

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
was more contemplative
or emotional,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
let's say in counseling or
in something of that sort.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Whereas someone who had an
air sign on their midheaven

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
might be someone who had to
make more use of their intellect

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:90%
at work.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And someone who had an earth
sign on their midheaven

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:84%
might be someone even in
construction, for example,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:84%
but someone who had more
sense of a grounded approach.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Now our midheavens are
tempered not only by the sign

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
but what planets may be near
to that sign or in that sign.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we can get an
understanding of the nature

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
of not who we are
individually but

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:90%
our place in the outer world.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.534 align:middle line:90%
