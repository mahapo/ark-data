00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.150 align:middle line:10%
One of the basic
axioms of astrology

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.630 align:middle line:10%
comes from the "Emerald
Tablets" and we know it

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:10%
as "as above, so below."

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:10%
The primary influence
of this "as above,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
so below" can be seen in
the movement and the cycles

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:10%
of the various planets.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Astrology is a study
of correspondences.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And corresponding the movement
and cycles and interactions

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of the various planets
with life here on Earth,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
we begin to understand the
nature of how we are connected

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to a greater fabric of
being, that our lives are

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:90%
not as separate as they seem.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And whether we're talking
about the phases of the Moon

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
or eclipses or Mercury
retrogrades or Saturn returns,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the fact is that it's more
complicated than it seems.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
The movement of planets
represents a map,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
just like you would
take a road map or a GPS

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
if you were going to be
going somewhere in space.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The movement of planets
represents a temporal map.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a map in time.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And by understanding the
nature of the archetypes

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:84%
of the various planets,
we begin to understand

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
our other journey,
not through space

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
but our individual
journey through time.
