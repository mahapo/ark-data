00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.740 align:middle line:10%
Usually, once someone
says, so what's your sign,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:10%
the next question is, do
you know your rising sign?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:10%
We astrologers map the
planets against the horizon

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
at the time of someone's birth.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign
very simply stated

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is the zodiac sign
that is appearing

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
on the eastern horizon
at any given moment.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the Earth spins around,
rotates, once every 24 hours,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
it appears that
each and every one

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
of the 12 signs of the
zodiac rise every single day.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Because of the tilt of the
earth and other weird planetary

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:84%
dynamics, different
signs can rise

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:84%
for different amounts
of time, meaning

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:90%
they arise faster or slower.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the rising sign
becomes an important part

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
of your personality
makeup, of your horoscope

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:90%
or your birth or natal chart.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So the rising sign is the
sign on the eastern horizon,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called your
ascendant or ascending sign.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The technical term ascendant
really is the exact point

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.340 align:middle line:84%
within the sign that's
rising, but these two terms

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
are often used interchangeably.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, the sun, and
the moon, and the rising sign

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes called
the big three.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if someone has
their son, moon, and rising

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
sign all in the same
sign, they would

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
often say, I'm a triple
Gemini, or of a triple Virgo,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that the sun,
the moon, and the rising sign

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
all move independently
at different rates.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
The sun goes through the zodiac
from earth's point of view

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:90%
once every year.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The moon goes through the zodiac
from earth's point of view

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:90%
once a moon-th.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And the rising signs will
go through the zodiac

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:90%
once every day.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:90%
The sun is who we are.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.430 align:middle line:10%
That's why sun sign
astrology works.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:10%
I am a Taurus.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I am bull or I am
Gemini, or you are.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
These are when we say, I
am, we say, I am, the sun

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:90%
is the center of who we are.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the fuel in the
center of our furnace.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.006 align:middle line:84%
It's the way the light is
originating within our being.

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The moon is how that light is
reflected on first glimpse.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:90%
The moon is how we feel.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's how we respond.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign
is not who we are.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
We can be any one of the
12 signs of the zodiac.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not how we feel.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
We can feel like any one of
the 12 signs of the zodiac.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign is how
the light rises off

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:90%
of us and into the environment.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're talking about
the sun rising every day.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're bored at
sunrise, your rising sign

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:90%
is the same as your sun sign.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think
of the rising sign

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
as how we dawn on other people.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the dance we dance
when we meet someone new.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:90%
We may be a certain way.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:90%
We may feel a certain way.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But every time we get
introduced to another person,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
we go into this, Hi,
my name is Joe Blow.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
My name is-- and
we do this dance

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that becomes familiar
to us as we grow older,

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.415 align:middle line:84%
because it's different
than who we are

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's different
than how we feel.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the dance we dance
when we meet someone new.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And by the second, or third, or
fourth dance with that person,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
they're beginning to say,
ahh, so you really this way.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:90%
You appeared that way to me.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign
is how we appear.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
It's how we seem
at first glance.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's often are physical
characteristics.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung called the rising sign
our persona or mask, meaning

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:90%
that it's our personality.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not who we are.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It's our personality.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the mask that
we hide behind.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:90%
But make no mistake about it.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.144 align:middle line:90%
It's not false.

00:04:20.144 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The mask is not something
separate from us.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:90%
The mask is part of us.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's like our veneer.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It's this surface that
we have that doesn't

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:90%
make it any less important.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
some ways it makes

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
it more important because the
only way the light of our sun

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
gets out and the only way
our feelings are expressed

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
are ultimately through
our rising sign.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that in Vedic or
in eastern astrology that they

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
consider the rising sign,
not just how we appear,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
it's not just how the
personality gets out,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's also they
consider it a doorway.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It's how the outside gets in.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The rising sign is like
the doorway to our soul.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think of it
as it's the way each

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and every one of us are nailed
to the three dimensional world.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We each have our
own cross to bear.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And the rising sign in
some ways represents

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:90%
that interface that we have.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:84%
We all each and
every one of us have

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
an interface with the
three dimensional world.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And our rising sign and in
particular our ascendant

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
is the point at which
we are interfaced,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
or connected, or nailed to
the three dimensional world.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:90%
