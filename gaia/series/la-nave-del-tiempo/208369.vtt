>> How did life on Earth begin?

What role in this was played
by alleged civilizations

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:90%
of other worlds?

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Were human beings created
by extraterrestrials?

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Do we live in a
parallel dimension?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Contact experiences contain
something that transcends

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:90%
the phenomenon-- information.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And it has been this
information that

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
has most intrigued witnesses
as well as investigators.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
knowledge communicated

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
by alleged extraterrestrial
intelligences, their history,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
their connection with humanity,
and the agenda that they

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:90%
intend to follow.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I warn you.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
What you are about to hear
may seem like a story out

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
of science fiction, or perhaps,
if we look at it differently,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
we might just face lost
memories of our cosmic history.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
According to information that
these beings have provided,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
both through direct
physical contact

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as in telepathic
transmissions that

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:84%
were confirmed through
scheduled sightings

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
like we discussed in
the previous episode,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.220 align:middle line:84%
the Earth, our planet,
is a world school and one

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
of many in the universe.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
World schools are true
laboratories of experimentation

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:90%
for life and evolution.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
These worlds are
protected by very advanced

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial civilizations,
which should not intervene

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:90%
directly in the process.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
According to contact reports,
the extraterrestrials

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:84%
that operate in
these missions are

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:90%
organized in four basic blocks.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The mentors within an
extraterrestrial hierarchy

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
are part of what they
call superior councils.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
These councils may carry out
a wide range of activities

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:90%
in different worlds.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.385 align:middle line:84%
Let me point out something
regarding these mentors.

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Within the
extraterrestrial councils,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
there are highly
evolved entities

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
that are chosen in
each cosmic quadrant.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
According to this
information, in our galaxy,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
there are 24 quadrants, like a
cake cut into 24 pieces, where

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the most evolved entity of
each of these 24 quadrants

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
is part of a mentor council,
the council of 24 mentors,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
which suspiciously reminds
me of the vision of John,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
the beloved disciple of
Jesus on the island of Patmos

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
as he faced the council
of the 24 elders.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Are we perhaps talking
about the same thing?

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
These 24 elders also
respond to a higher council,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:84%
which in this case, has
nothing to do with our galaxy

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
but with what is
called the local group.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
For extraterrestrials,
the local group

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:84%
is made up of a major galaxy
and other satellite galaxies.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.930 align:middle line:84%
In our case, they
sectioned off the galaxy

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
of Andromeda and eight
satellite galaxies,

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
among which, obviously,
our galaxy is located.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So that superior council of
what are called the 24 elders

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
would be the council
of nine from Andromeda,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
containing a representative
of each of the eight satellite

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
galaxies and a representative
of the Andromeda galaxy.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this information
is unverifiable.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It is based on extraterrestrial
contact messages,

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
but it is evidence, at least
according to these experiences,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that there is perhaps a superior
extraterrestrial organization.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And here on Earth, the only
thing that we are familiar with

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:84%
is the last link, the one that
carries out the aid missions.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we are talking about
friendly contact missions.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I am referring to the
anthropological contact

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
experiences that we affirm
to have experienced.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like watching a
bridge being built.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
We have only met the
workers and bricklayers,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
but there are architects
who are behind the project.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
extraterrestrial mentor

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
councils.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
The space gardeners, a
kind of scientific arm

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of these councils
who have the ability

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to sow life in suitable
worlds, modify planets, modify

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
their creatures, and
all this following

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
a purpose for evolution,
the guardians and watchman

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:84%
groups for observation
and protection

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of worlds with military
response capacity,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:90%
to put it in human terms.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
instructors who are sent.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We could describe them
as extraterrestrial

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.450 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists, guides, or
advisors who can make contact

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:90%
with members of a civilization.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Ivica, Antarel, or
extraterrestrial entities

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
whom we affirm to have met,
they belong to this group--

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
counselors, instructors,
anthropologists

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
who are in communication
with the witnesses on Earth.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:10%
According to this
controversial information,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:10%
it would have been the
so-called space gardeners

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:10%
who sowed life on our planet as
part of a long-term evolution

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:10%
plan.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.910 align:middle line:84%
The starting point was
planting a seed in our oceans.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:84%
When on Earth, these
would no longer be acidic,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:84%
at the perfect time, they left a
seed that came from the cosmos.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And the objective was
to promote the emergence

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of different forms of life
in a world like ours that,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
according to them,
brings together very

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:90%
special characteristics.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
had chosen the Earth

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because it is a blue aura
planet in a single-star system,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
a world that, in addition,
no longer had a future.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:90%
I will explain.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Strictly according to these
messages, extraterrestrials

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:84%
could not intervene in the
timeline of a world that

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:90%
was running its natural course.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.650 align:middle line:84%
They could only intervene in a
planet that had already died.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
According to contact
messages, our planet Earth

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
had faced meteor showers
in a very distant past

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%
some 1.2 billion years ago.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I reiterate, this is
according to these messages

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
That is to say that the
Earth lay devastated and was

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
unable to support any type of
civilization in the future.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.470 align:middle line:84%
However, potentially
the Earth was a world

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:84%
with special characteristics,
what extraterrestrials

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:90%
call a blue aura world.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the
blue aura of the Earth

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
as a characteristic that
the extraterrestrials have

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.830 align:middle line:84%
evaluated to see if it could
be a school world or laboratory

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:84%
world, I'm not necessarily
referring to those photographs

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
from space where due to
the atmospheric composition

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and other physical
phenomena, the Earth

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
looks blue in color, but
due to a characteristic

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
of subtle radiation which
our current science has not

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:84%
been able to understand
or properly detect.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial technology
has been able to,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and it makes up part of the
Earth's electromagnetic field,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
which, as we all
know, is formed inside

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
in the nucleus of our world
and is emitted from the poles

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:84%
and generates that protective
web around the Earth.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
What is called
the magnetosphere.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not that the
magnetosphere is blue,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:10%
but there is a phenomenon
behind that process of creation

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:10%
of the magnetosphere which
emits a blue vibrational field

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:10%
conducive to life, which is
a very important radiation

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:10%
for the extraterrestrials
and that is heated,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:10%
forged within the Earth itself.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:10%
They say that it has to
do with the existence

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:10%
of huge, immense
crystals that are found

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:10%
in the depths of the Earth,
and those big crystals

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:10%
are responsible for the entire
energy structure of our world.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:84%
These gigantic crystals, which
exist in the underground world

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
very close to the
nucleus of the Earth,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
according to these
extraterrestrial messages

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.250 align:middle line:84%
are channeling forces that even
come from outside the Earth,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
catalyze the energies

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the planet.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And this emits or generates some
type of frequency or vibration

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that generates this great
blue field of our world.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
They are ideal world so
that different forms of life

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:90%
may develop there.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Usually, these planets
are found in solar systems

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:90%
with one single star.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:84%
As we know, solar systems are
usually binary or trinary.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:90%
They have two or three stars.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But ours has only one
sun, only one star,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
a yellow dwarf that maintains
the solar system in balance.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, an advanced
extraterrestrial civilization

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
would have reached
our planet, and it

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
would have generated a
spacetime paradox, if you will,

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
a story that seems taken
from a science fiction tale.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
They would have traveled
before the meteor shower

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
incident on Earth to
generate an alternate time

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
different from the course
of destruction that

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
had followed our world.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, if the
incident of meteor showers

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
were not to have
occurred, the Earth

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
would have continued
on an alternate course

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
until, at some future time,
it would have rejoined

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the universe
after having operated

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:90%
in that parallel universe.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials
called this phenomenon

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
the separation of alternate
time from the real-time

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not that a real-time
of the universe exists.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a symbolic
concept provided

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
by these alleged
extraterrestrial

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
communications, which describe
the multidimensionality where

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:90%
creatures in a multiverse live.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials--

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'll try to explain
it in very human terms

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
because it is very
difficult to understand-- we

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
as a planet and a
species have been

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:90%
following a type of timeline.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:10%
But even before the very
appearance of our species,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:10%
the Earth's timeline was
cut due to the impact

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.770 align:middle line:10%
from that meteor shower.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:90%
It is very simple to understand.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
If we look today with the
telescope, neighboring planets,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and even our
satellite, we can see

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
that they've been terribly
impacted by bodies, objects,

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
asteroids, and the
craters are there.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
However, we observe our planet,
and it doesn't have that many.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
They say that we
jumped the timeline

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
with extraordinary
technological assistance

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and interdimensional
technology unimaginable

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to us, which was applied
before the Earth was

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:90%
impacted by this meteor shower.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And an alternate
timeline was created

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a snake
which at some point

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
will have to bite
its tail, and we

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
will return to a timeline of
real-time in the universe.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Some think that
this shift already

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
happened in the year
2012, coinciding

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
with the end of the Mayan
calendar, the Long Count,

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
something that we will discuss
in an upcoming episode.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it
hasn't happened yet.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
It is a gradual
process that is going

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
multiple realities,

00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%
and not with just one.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Different timelines,
those of these beings

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and the different
timelines of human history,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:84%
will converge at one
point and the result

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
will be a type of
transformation.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the gradual
process of living it.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:84%
This alternate timeline
in which we are living,

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a
huge hologram, has

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.620 align:middle line:84%
caused these beings who visit
us and observe us to establish

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
very strict rules, rules
such as no human being

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
may physically go
beyond the moon's orbit.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Our satellite's orbit
marks the physical limit

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
for the exit of this
alternate reality.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Those cases of extraterrestrial
contacts where witnesses

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:84%
say that they have traveled
beyond the solar system

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.370 align:middle line:84%
would not have been physical
material experiences

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
but, in fact, inter-dimensional
holographic projections

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
according to these
extraterrestrial messages.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
For this reason, living a kind
of alternate reality, they,

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.720 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial members of
the alliance that I mentioned,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
established a kind of
planetary quarantine

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
that will exist until
human beings discover

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
a new subatomic technology
that they call minius,

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
that will change the
rules of the game.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It will completely change
all of the protocols

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.340 align:middle line:84%
because if humanity were to
find the Holy Grail of physics,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the Big Hadron
Colliders, obviously,

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
they would no longer
need to take care of us

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and would no longer
prevent us from traveling

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:90%
beyond the solar system.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And that means not
just abandoning

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
this physical reality
called Earth, but,

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
in fact, according
to these beings,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:59.700 align:middle line:84%
leaving this spacetime
bubble where we are now.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, I
think we are going

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:09.990 align:middle line:84%
through very complex trials
as a species on the planet.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But despite this
difficulty that we

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
are facing as a learning
experience, which

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
has been cyclical
throughout civilizations,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced
that, at some time,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
as humans, we will
cast aside the past,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and as my dear friend
Edgar Mitchell,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.940 align:middle line:84%
the Apollo 14
astronaut would say,

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
we will transform ourselves into
an interplanetary community,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and we will become
a cosmic humanity.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to achieve it.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have
to face and resolve

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:90%
these big learning experiences.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
If this story is real,
very advanced civilizations

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
with technology and knowledge
far beyond our imagination

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
would have created a parallel
reality so that later on life

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
may be sown in our world.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
our planet will

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
have to get back on the
path of our timeline,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and we may face danger like
asteroid impact or meteor

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:84%
showers, or other
circumstances of cosmic origin

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that will put our
humanity to the test.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Unless the developing
humanity here on Earth

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.510 align:middle line:84%
can reach a sufficient
level of consciousness,

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
a sufficient level
of inner contact

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to generate a
great transformation that

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:90%
modifies that other timeline.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It's what extraterrestrials
call the great operation

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.260 align:middle line:84%
of the worlds schools,
worlds that, as I said,

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:90%
did not have a future.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.570 align:middle line:84%
They were dead worlds where an
alternate dimensional state was

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
created for them, where a
new civilization may arise,

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and these already developed
creatures or civilizations,

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
as in the case of
the human species,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
may move beyond their own
past, overcome their trials,

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
and arise as a civilization
of consciousness that

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
can change not only their
future but rather affect

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
the future of the monitors
of this cosmic project.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.660 align:middle line:90%
But what is time?

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
How does all this
fit into the history

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:90%
of the so-called cosmic plan?

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
time is a measurement
for human beings.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:90%
It does not exist as such.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.080 align:middle line:84%
It is simply a perception
according to our location.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We usually build a structure
to observe the universe

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
based on a line that we call
past, present, and future.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But according to these
beings, time is an illusion,

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and it could be
happening simultaneously

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:90%
in different realities.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:84%
We also find this problem
in the dimensions.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.460 align:middle line:84%
As we know in physics,
the three dimensions

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
in which human
beings operate are

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
equivalent to the measurement
of length, width, and depth.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Time could be the
fourth dimension.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But could there be
other layers of reality,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:84%
such as those defined by
scientists like Dr. Michio

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Kaku, one of the fathers
of the string field theory,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
which says that, at a
minimum, in this model,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:90%
11 dimensions should exist?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it probable that these beings
come from superior dimensions

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand as
if we were going back to this

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
story of plane land, where
a triangle and a square

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.260 align:middle line:84%
in a plane cannot include the
manifestation of the three

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
dimensions of a pyramid and
a cube because they do not

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
contain the capacity
for a third dimension?

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all these scientific
riddles, as well as

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, are the
key to understanding

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that we live in an alternate
time and a dimension

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that covers
the entire planet generated

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.040 align:middle line:84%
artificially like a matrix,
like a hologram that is

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:90%
part of a learning experience.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.370 align:middle line:84%
If this is so, everything
that we perceive,

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that there is
a reality that we cannot reach,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
be it physical,
interdimensional,

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
or without time, it all goes
through our mental perception.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
This is why these beings say
that whoever has your mind

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:90%
has your time.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And if your mind is
your own, your time is--

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is worth
repeating-- timeless.

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And you are a free creature
with capacity to learn.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
This is what is encompassed in
the mystery of school worlds

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:90%
like the Earth.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And how long, since
we're talking about time,

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
from our human perspective,
could this transformation,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:90%
this plan take?

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
When will humanity finally reach
that level of consciousness

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
followed and monitored by
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
that even, as I said,
had sown life on Earth

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:90%
as part of the experiment?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:84%
They say that this journey
towards an upper sphere

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness is gradual.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It can't be all at once.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a
step-by-step introduction

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
multiple realities.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And before all this
occurs, without a doubt,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:84%
we will have to face
a series of tests

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of learning for
human beings to be

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
able to arise as
conscious beings.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.700 align:middle line:84%
After establishing this
alternate time on Earth

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and creating these
interdimensional conditions

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.240 align:middle line:84%
so that future
humanities may arise,

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial missions
will become fully involved

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.320 align:middle line:84%
in the evolution
of human beings.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
According to our
information, the process

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:90%
was developed in Africa.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
There, ancient
proto-hominids were modified.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Ancestors of our human
ancestors in lands

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:18.330 align:middle line:84%
now forgotten, which many
esoteric writers call Lemuria.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:84%
In order to talk about Lemuria,
you must immerse yourself

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:90%
in a sea of information.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
There are texts by
important geologists

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.760 align:middle line:84%
where we will also
find information

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:84%
that has been received in
the world of channeling

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:84%
some very controversial
and others

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:90%
very deep and interesting.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:10%
Also, esoteric
texts, such as those

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:10%
published back in the
day, the Theosophy,

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:10%
with Madame Blavatsky
as the leader.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We all may remember
The Secret Doctrine

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:90%
that she published in 1888.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But let's try to organize this
information, which is also

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:90%
cited by the extraterrestrials.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.130 align:middle line:84%
For starters, Lemuria
was a land bridge

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
linking the southeastern area
of Africa with Madagascar.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Some writers have
confused it with Mu,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:90%
which is something else.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:90%
These lands are now submerged.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But in the Pacific
Ocean, they have

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.240 align:middle line:84%
more of a connection to the
legends of the Hopi natives,

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.860 align:middle line:90%
as we will see later.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Some important geologists
like Philip Slater

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
or the German Haeckel had talked
about those submerged lands

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
between Africa and
Madagascar to explain

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that lemurs, very cute primates
with a prominent snout,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
a long tail, and soft fur,
lived both in Madagascar

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and Africa separated by the
waters of the Indian Ocean.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It was they who
suggested, therefore,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
that in very ancient times,
there was a land bridge that

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:90%
connected the two.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And this land bridge, in
honor of these primates,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
was called Lemuria.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And in some area of
those lost lands,

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials,
according to these messages,

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
intervened in a group
of proto-hominids

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
so that they could transform
into the Homo sapiens sapiens

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that we know today.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And Lemuria would
have been just one

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:84%
of many forgotten
prehistoric civilizations,

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
such as Atlantis, that the
Egyptian priests revealed

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:90%
to the Greek sages.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Cultures prior to
the Great Flood

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
after the appearance of
humans, the extraterrestrials

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
were dedicated to educate
the first communities.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It was the beginning of
what we call civilization.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
It is not difficult to imagine
that for our distant ancestors,

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
those beings who
arrived from heaven

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
were like gods, entities
who led numerous processes

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.870 align:middle line:84%
of intervention in our
history, many of them

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.320 align:middle line:84%
have been forgotten in the
fog of times long past,

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:84%
which today we consider
fantastic myths or legends.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It is the stage of humanity
that dates back even prior

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to the emergence of great
cultures like Sumer or Egypt,

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
a lost era when those,
quote, "gods" lived on Earth.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
If beings from other worlds
have been responsible

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:84%
for the advent of
life on Earth, what

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
about the human concept
of a creator God,

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:90%
which I am often asked?

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that the participation
of extraterrestrial entities

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:36.930 align:middle line:84%
in missions to sow life on
Earth and their possible role

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
in genetic projects that
helped in the evolution of man,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:84%
as we just discussed as
in the case of Lemuria,

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
does not call into
question the existence

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
of an intelligent cosmic
order, not at all.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, humans are already
making significant advances

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.010 align:middle line:84%
in genetics, and we have plans
for very serious projects

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
to terraform planets like Mars.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Does that negate the
existence of God,

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
or does it make us look like
gods compared to creatures

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
with lesser knowledge?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:10%
We should not forget the work
of recognized British molecular

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:10%
biologist Francis Crick, winner,
along with Watson and Wilkins,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:10%
of the Nobel Prize in medicine.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:31.560 align:middle line:84%
In 1962 for their
DNA research, who,

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
together with his fellow
countrymen, Chemist Leslie

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Orgel, proposed
that life on Earth

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
may have been
intentionally disseminated.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:84%
I repeat-- intentionally
disseminated

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
by an advanced
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about Nobel
Prize winning scientists.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It is shocking then to admit
that an unknown portion

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of our history may have been
affected by beings originating

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
from other stars, beings
who not only sowed life

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
but who have followed the
progress of the human species

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to the point of having helped
us create civilization.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.990 align:middle line:84%
But I should clarify
that with this, I'm

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.900 align:middle line:84%
not saying that the
pyramids of Egypt

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.230 align:middle line:84%
or the Nazca Lines in
my country in Peru,

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as any other world
archeological centers, all

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:84%
have been built directly
by extraterrestrials.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I do not adhere to
those theories that

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
maintain that human
beings did not

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:90%
build the wonders of antiquity.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I simply rely on the
information provided

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.110 align:middle line:84%
by these beings who
affirmed that, in the past,

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
they were observing our
process and influencing it

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:90%
as initiators of knowledge.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
They gave us some of
the secrets of heaven

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and secrets of the Earth so that
we could begin to move forward.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, if all of this really
happened like this, old legends

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and stories about the
gods we can find anywhere

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, they will
take on another meaning--

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
tales of supernatural
beings in which they

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.530 align:middle line:84%
affirm to have come
from the stars, entities

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:84%
from the sky who
unite with human women

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and produce giant sons, like
the events on Mount Hermon

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:84%
or heavenly personages
who engage in epic

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
disputes among themselves
over human destinies.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Elusive creatures who
provide knowledge, rules,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and laws for the
coexistence of the tribes,

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
or what about the
famous angels who

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:84%
fly in chariots of fire and
guide groups of people, gods

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:51.430 align:middle line:84%
who hide inside mountains or in
uncharted oceans, who stepped

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:55.750 align:middle line:84%
forward as mentors and after
a long time of assistance

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to their human disciples,
they decide to leave

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.910 align:middle line:90%
but promising to come back.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.520 align:middle line:84%
An authentic encyclopedia
of information

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:84%
alludes to those heavenly
beings and their actions

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in the early stages
of our history.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Are these sheer coincidences
from the human imagination

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world?

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.810 align:middle line:84%
There are hundreds of
cases, if not thousands,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:26.650 align:middle line:84%
too many to just relegate
to mere beliefs, myths,

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and religion just for
the sake of experimenting

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.220 align:middle line:84%
while the universe's
is dynamic evolution

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is occurring where the
only constant is change.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
our universe has
three great planes--

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:84%
a material plane, a mental
plane, and a spiritual plane.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Each of them is contained
within the other.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.650 align:middle line:84%
This is just an explanation
so that we can understand it.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Humans and even human
extraterrestrials who visit us

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
live on a physical plane
that has multiple dimensions.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:84%
According to these
messages, there

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:90%
are seven main dimensions.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
In these dimensions,
we are creatures

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.910 align:middle line:84%
flowing in this
material universe

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.070 align:middle line:90%
in this plane of matter.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Humans, according to them,
are moving from a third

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to a fourth dimension
of consciousness.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about dimensions
from a concept of physics.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Some messages and
other channeling

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
affirm that we can even make a
leap to even higher dimensions.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even to a fifth
dimension of consciousness,

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:84%
but our work consists
in transcending

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to the next dimension of
consciousness, the mystery

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.960 align:middle line:90%
of the fourth dimension.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
They say that creatures
who preceded us,

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
advanced cosmic
civilizations, were advancing

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.480 align:middle line:84%
to a fourth dimension
of consciousness

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to a fifth dimension
of consciousness

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.190 align:middle line:84%
to a sixth dimension
of consciousness,

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.380 align:middle line:84%
but suddenly they
became stagnant.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:84%
According to the story
of the extraterrestrials,

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:13.850 align:middle line:84%
their technological
and mental development

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that had been a great
spark in advancing

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.830 align:middle line:84%
in the evolution of
the universe had also

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.580 align:middle line:84%
caused a disconnection
with their emotions

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
with the connection
with their own essence,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:84%
almost transformed themselves
in a way into living

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:84%
robots like androids
who only followed

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:84%
the laws of the universe - very
conscious, very intellectual,

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:90%
very technological.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And they could not
advance towards what

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
they call the dimension
boundary, the seventh level

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, that jumps
to that eternal mental plane

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:84%
where time, as we perceive
it, no longer exists.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.510 align:middle line:84%
A fascinating story, a
large-scale evolutionary

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:90%
stagnation to cold.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And the only way of resolving
it was for new creatures

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:90%
to emerge.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.320 align:middle line:84%
New worlds like
Earth, school planets,

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:84%
where these new creatures having
their genetics, the heritage

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that preceded them could
through these tests

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
be on the path
towards transformation

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:84%
into a new higher
civilization that

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.080 align:middle line:84%
may arise in the
middle of conflict

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and in the midst of learning
so worlds like Earth

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:90%
began to acquire meaning.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:10%
So that despite our
genetic inheritance

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:10%
of technologically
advanced civilizations

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:10%
which, at some
point, some of them

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:50.810 align:middle line:10%
became very technological
and even hostile.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.390 align:middle line:10%
Although, this sounds like a
contradiction in the universe

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:10%
that higher civilization
may develop in a way

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.630 align:middle line:10%
that transforms them
into colonizing races,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:10%
but according to the
extraterrestrials

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:10%
this did happen.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And this brought
consequences that

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:84%
are unimaginable for us to
comprehend because they were

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.330 align:middle line:84%
disconnecting
themselves, as I said,

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:84%
from the essence
that had linked them

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.510 align:middle line:84%
at some point with the
purity of the universe.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Not everything is science.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Not everything is technology.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Not everything is knowledge.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.200 align:middle line:84%
If you depart from
your real self,

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:84%
you can transform into
something very different.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what level
of evolution you are on

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is what
would have happened.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the Earth
and similar school worlds,

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:48.080 align:middle line:84%
had to develop a
different context

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.360 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be something
different from what

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:84%
their older siblings
from the stars had been.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Something we will discuss
in greater depth when

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
we go into the
extraterrestrial wars--

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Egypt and the
intricacies of Orion.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, although, it
seems incredible

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and today, I still find
it difficult to accept.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But according to the story
of the extraterrestrials,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:90%
there were wars.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The so-called wars
of Orion, which

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
we have reported for decades
in our contact experiences.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
After these
extraterrestrial wars--

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
as if it were an episode of
George Lucas's "Star Wars"

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
just in cosmic
reality, an alliance

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.230 align:middle line:84%
had to be created, an alliance
of the civilizations that

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
supported peace and for
sowing a new civilization

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:84%
in different quadrants
of the universe.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And that alliance is what
is behind current close

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.830 align:middle line:84%
encounters, at least, the
friendly close encounters

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.080 align:middle line:84%
led by the guides,
the extraterrestrial

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists
that I mentioned.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, not
all civilizations

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
found in the cosmos are
a part of this alliance.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the positions
on this huge cosmic chessboard

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
that humans call
The War of the Gods

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
and the human species
right in the middle

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:90%
of this cosmic drama.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:10%
The disturbing thing is that
the extraterrestrial story

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:10%
maintains that not
all civilizations

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.880 align:middle line:10%
of our Galactic environment
were part of this alliance.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.540 align:middle line:84%
I reiterate, other
civilizations existed

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and exist who have different
perspectives on the new school

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.530 align:middle line:90%
worlds and their creatures.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Creatures that can be dangerous
from their perspective, that

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:45.489 align:middle line:84%
could threaten an
old cosmic order.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But for the alliance, creatures
that could change everything.

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:84%
We will look into this
in upcoming episodes.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.139 align:middle line:84%
According to these beings,
part of modern contact

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:84%
would be to the extraterrestrial
missions of the alliance

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:00.820 align:middle line:90%
that I spoke of.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Their mission, evaluate
and on occasion,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
assist, within its
demanding protocol

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:90%
of no direct participation.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:84%
The final stage of
this human process

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that will lead sooner or later
to a journey to the stars--

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.380 align:middle line:84%
a space odyssey where
humans being descendants

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials,
plain and simple,

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.800 align:middle line:84%
could also transform into
the extraterrestrials

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.580 align:middle line:90%
of the future.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Those who have
followed my work you

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:84%
know what I mean in the secret
space program, the mystery

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.340 align:middle line:84%
of Alpha Centauri
that we have already

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:90%
discussed in other programs.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So they, whoever they are
haven't left since way

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:84%
back then from those old
visits to our planet.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.380 align:middle line:84%
They have merely
distanced themselves

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.130 align:middle line:84%
to observe us so that humans
could stand on our own two

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:90%
feet.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:84%
However, under
limited circumstances,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:84%
they could appear like they
did in the wave of contacts

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.940 align:middle line:90%
of the 1940s.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Why did they come back in
the modern era of UFOs?

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a mystery that we will
reveal on the next voyage

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:90%
of "The Arc of Time."

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez Corpancho.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.110 align:middle line:84%
You are aboard
"The Arc of Time."

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.460 align:middle line:90%

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.000 align:middle line:90%
