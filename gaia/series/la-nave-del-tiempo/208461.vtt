>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> As we discussed in
the previous episode,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
beings from other worlds obeying
a master plan of cosmic scope

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
would have fostered
life on our planet.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Over time, they were
monitoring our evolution.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And on occasion,
they mixed with us.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
However, later they opted
for a long period of silence.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It was the decade of the
1940s in the 20th century when

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:90%
they came back.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:90%
Because something happened.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, human
experiments to split

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the atom and the exploration
of other dimensions

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:84%
activated what I call
the return of the cause.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We take ourselves
back to July 16, 1945.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
At that time in Alamogordo,
New Mexico here in the United

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
States, they had
successfully developed

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
the Trinity Experiment, part
of the top secret Manhattan

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Project, as we will recall,
led by the nuclear physicist

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Robert Oppenheimer, one of the
fathers of the atomic bomb.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:10%
The detonation of Trinity,
a 20-kiloton plutonium bomb,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:10%
was the last straw for
the extraterrestrials,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:10%
who were monitoring
our learning process.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt,
this was a bad sign.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's not forget that a little
while after this detonation

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:84%
at Alamogordo, August 6 of that
same year, 1945, the United

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
States would drop an atomic
bomb on the Japanese city

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
of Hiroshima and,
three days later,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.702 align:middle line:90%
another bomb on Nagasaki.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
The attack became one of
the most despicable episodes

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
of World War II
and perhaps, I dare

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
say, of the history of humanity,
a sorrowful, worrying image

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
of human beings and
their use of technology.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Oppenheimer himself, after
the tests for the Manhattan

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Project, had already warned
us using a sentence borrowed

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
from the "Bhagavad Gita,"
an account of ancient India

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
which narrates the
battles of the gods

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:84%
with the use of what appear
to be bombs and flying ships.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.302 align:middle line:10%
He says, "Now I am become
death, the destroyer of worlds."

00:02:56.302 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the scientist said,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
quoting chapter 11, verse
32 of that sacred text.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
did humans know

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.810 align:middle line:90%
the terror of nuclear weapons?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
enigmatic Brahmastra

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
that mentions other
ancient texts of India,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
was it one of the supernatural
weapons of the gods?

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
This new human weapon based on
an uncontrolled nuclear fission

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:90%
chain reaction--

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the type
of bombs dropped on Japan--

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:90%
alerted the extraterrestrials.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
They considered that
with these experiments,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
we were not only affecting
our reality but also that

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of other creatures
in the multiverse.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And apparently,
this nuclear testing

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the only thing that moved
the complex web of spacetime.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
In 1943, two years before the
bombs fell on Japanese ground,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
the US Navy carried out the
controversial Philadelphia

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Experiment, a
secret invisibility

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
project in Philadelphia's Navy
shipyards, a well-known case.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Different sources maintain that
the controversial experiment

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
was based on the
discoveries of scientists

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
like Nikola Tesla, the renowned
Croatian inventor and genius

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:84%
in the field of electromagnetism
who had discovered the way

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate powerful sources
of unconventional energy

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
to open portals
between dimensions.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
The few witnesses
say in those years

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
that the US Eldridge
DE-173, after disappearing,

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
was seen for several minutes
in Norfolk, Virginia.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That is 373 miles away from
the experiment, to be precise.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Then the battleship
reappeared in Philadelphia.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
This alleged case
of teleportation,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
besides causing horrible
side effects on its crew,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
opened a gap in
the spacetime that

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:90%
worried the extraterrestrials.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
With the subsequent
development and detonation

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear bombs, it is
clear that the scenario

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:90%
became complicated.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
And so they decided to act.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It was the prelude to
the modern UFO era.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Scholars of the UFO
phenomenon know well

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
what happened in 1947, two years
after the end of World War II.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.190 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about the
increase in sightings

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:10%
of unidentified flying
objects and, in fact,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.260 align:middle line:10%
the report of strange devices
that had crashed on Earth.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We are talking
about famous cases

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
such as the sighting by Kenneth
Arnold, who has been discussed

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
many times on Gaia, or that of
the alleged extraterrestrial

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:84%
ship that crashed in
Roswell, New Mexico.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Reams have been written
about these files as well

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:90%
as numerous documentaries.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
disturbing questions

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:84%
is, why did a ship supposedly
from another world crash

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, specifically
in Roswell?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
You will recall that in
the previous episode,

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I made a reference
to what is known

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:90%
as the planetary quarantine.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, this quarantine
was established

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
by advanced extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:84%
in order to protect human
beings from any interference

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and silently observe
everything that

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:84%
happened in our
planetary environs

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:90%
over thousands of years.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
This quarantine was
more tightly enforced.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And their rules became
stricter as a result

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
of our nuclear experiments.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:84%
As a result, too, of the
strange Philadelphia project,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
everything we generated
with those technological and

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.680 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional
experiments would

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
have made the
cosmos see humanity

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:90%
as not being very prudent.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
We were playing with fire.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And this exposed us.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Visits from civilizations
with similar mindsets,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
as birds of a feather
flock together,

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
civilizations with
technological,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.330 align:middle line:84%
warlike, and
colonizing tendencies

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
might be attracted
to come to our world

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.530 align:middle line:84%
and observe what
human beings were

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
doing with this blue planet.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was for that
reason, like I said,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that our planet began to
live through a new stage

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.730 align:middle line:84%
of this planetary quarantine,
but with greater rigor,

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:90%
with greater intensity.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
These beings who heard the
signal of the atom bomb,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
the signal of the
Philadelphia Experiment,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
came to our world to
explore technologically

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:90%
what we were doing.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, they didn't
come with positive intentions

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
in the context of what is
known as the cosmic plan

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and the context of learning
and the future of humanity.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
When these ships arrived on
Earth in the 1940s especially,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
it was not the first
time they did so.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But back then, they
returned in force,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
bringing a group of small
beings with a prominent head,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:84%
with markedly oblique eyes,
practically black membranes

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
for eyes, what many ufology
scholars today call the Grays.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.200 align:middle line:84%
They have no conscience
of their own.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:84%
They're like biological robots
controlled by the civilization

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:90%
that sent them to our planet.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
When all this started
to occur, the alliance

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:84%
that I referred to
previously decided

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
to block them in the context
of the planetary quarantine.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:10%
Yes, what I'm saying,
although it sounds farfetched,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:10%
is that extraterrestrials'
ships like those that crashed

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:10%
in Roswell were shot down--

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.023 align:middle line:10%
and not by us, but
by those beings who

00:08:51.023 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:10%
are part of the
alliance and were trying

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:10%
to prevent the involvement
and the actions

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:10%
of these biological robots
that came to study us.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this
protective perimeter

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:90%
was not 100% effective.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:90%
There were some breaches.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And also, although
this sounds incredible,

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
some of these biological robots
were already literally buried

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
on our planet from old
extraterrestrial visits

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:84%
in the early times of
Sumer, for example.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And they were reactivated.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:84%
They were awakened to do
a whole series of studies

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
on the human species
from biological, genetic,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and technological standpoints.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And obviously,
since we're talking

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
about biological
robots, they do not

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.385 align:middle line:84%
have the consciousness of
behavior that we would expect.

00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the most
complicated contract cases

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:90%
and more difficult to address.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to
abduction events.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I should mention that some
investigators like my dear

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.530 align:middle line:84%
friends Paola Harris and French
scientist and ufologist Jacques

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Vallee have been
investigating these cases

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
of atomic explosions and their
relationship to UFO sightings

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and also with objects
that have crashed.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:84%
One of these events is
Trinity itself since shortly

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
after the explosion
in New Mexico,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
an incident occurred in which
an object crashed in the area.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
extensively investigated

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.360 align:middle line:90%
by Harris and Jacques Vallee.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
1945, precisely two

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
years before Roswell.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Parallel to all this,
cases of contact witnesses

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:90%
began to be reported often.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about, besides
sightings and reports

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
of alleged ships
crashing to the ground,

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
different people came
forward in the United States

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and also in other
parts of the world who

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
affirmed who have met beings
with human features who

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
brought a message of
consciousness and peace

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I could mention, for
example, Daniel Walter Fry,

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
George Adamski, or, even
in Italy, Eugenio Siragusa.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But mentioned before, the
case of the so-called Grays

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:84%
is very particular
since their appearance

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
has spread in
extraterrestrial pop culture.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Just walk down the street.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And ask any child, draw
me an extraterrestrial.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And they will automatically
draw that type of entity with

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
a large head like an upside-down
pear and those immense,

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:84%
dark eyes that look somewhat
like some cave paintings--

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
some petroglyphs as well in
different parts of the world.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Wandjinas in
Australia come to mind now.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Are they beings who were
here among us long ago?

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Or are we confusing
ancient shamanic beliefs

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
with alleged
extraterrestrial visits?

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if they
really were creatures

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that ancient humans painted
just as they saw them,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
we would have to ask
ourselves, why were they

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:90%
here since those remote times?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
If they are biological
robots, a kind of clones,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
as stated by the
extraterrestrials

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in their messages,
who created them?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Who controls them?

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And why were they sent to Earth?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, this
type of creature

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.890 align:middle line:84%
was created as a type
of technological worker

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
by different advanced
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:84%
especially, according
to our information,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.405 align:middle line:84%
by those cultures that developed
in the Orion star sector.

00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:10%
The civilizations of
Orion-- and remember

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:10%
that when I speak of Orion, it
is an arbitrary group of stars

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.310 align:middle line:10%
that forms what we call a
constellation, stars that

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:10%
are separated by
hundreds of light years

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:10%
with multiple planetary
systems, according to what

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:10%
the extraterrestrials say.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.080 align:middle line:10%
But particularly,
the civilizations

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:10%
linked to the
great star of Rigel

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:10%
would have been
involved in the creation

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:10%
of this type of entity, but
also other civilizations that

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:10%
are unknown to us.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Not everything is
concentrated in that sector

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that we call Orion, the
constellation of Sahu,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the great hunter,
like it was called

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient Egyptians.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
At that time, these
beings came to Earth

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to carry out
scientific research,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:90%
especially at the mineral level.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
They were confined to
the hollows of the earth

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
to do mining work, according
to this information I reiterate

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrials.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But after fulfilling these
functions, they were turned off

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and reactivated to do
other research, mostly

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
of a genetic, biological
nature in human beings

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
since those who were
being sent to the earth

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.060 align:middle line:84%
were being blocked by
planetary quarantine controlled

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:90%
by the alliance I mentioned.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this all sounds
crazy and farfetched.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But if these messages sent
by beings from other worlds

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
are real, what kind of
cosmic scenario are we in?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the Roswell
case and others

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
that preceded it such
as incidents associated

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
with the explosion of Trinity
have not been the only ones.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
There have been reports in
numerous parts of the world,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
even in South America, cases
that have always described

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.410 align:middle line:84%
the same characteristics
of small bodies

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
under four feet in
height, approximately,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
with a very large head similar
in appearance to the Greys

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:90%
we discussed.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:84%
We do not know of any
specific documented

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
cases of beings with human
features who have crashed

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and whose bodies
have been found.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
There are some rumors,
some information.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
But none of them
have been able to be

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
verified like in the other
cases that we have mentioned.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:10%
Colonel Philip Corso, author
of a very famous book,

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:10%
"The Day After Roswell,"
called these kinds

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:10%
of beings extraterrestrial
biological entities, or EBEs.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And according to him, thanks
to human technological research

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
of these incidents of
ships that have crashed,

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
even of biological
bodies of these Greys,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
we've developed a series of
things like fiber optics,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
network integrated circuits, or
even night vision technology,

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
which arose from a study of
the eyes of these small beings

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of these biological
androids that

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
had a kind of black membrane
covering their eye sockets.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have many mysteries to be
discovered about these cases.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's just a segment of
what is happening in contact.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing is that
there are human-looking beings.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
ask ourselves why.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Do we look like them?

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:90%
Or do they look like us?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
If we begin to piece
together different stories

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
through timelines,
they are here among us

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to share a message
of transformation, of change

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.015 align:middle line:84%
without intervening
directly in our matters.

00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I will say
that when we speak

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
entities who were confined

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
at some time in our history
in an underground world,

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.970 align:middle line:84%
it could be confused with
other information that

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:84%
speaks of beings who are also
from the intraterrestrial

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:90%
But this is very broad.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
In the intraterrestrial
world, these beings

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
called Greys could
exist, as I said,

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%
having fulfilled some scientific
functions in the past.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And as if they were machines,
they were turned off

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and then reactivated
for other functions

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.740 align:middle line:90%
also of a scientific nature.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There are also colonies
of extraterrestrial beings

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
with human features like the
case that we mentioned before,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
beings like Ivika or Antarel,
this group from Alpha Centauri

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.100 align:middle line:84%
who have used the depths
of mountains like Huascaran

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.590 align:middle line:84%
in the Peruvian Andes
as their bases--

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.460 align:middle line:84%
or even, although this sounds
a little stranger and esoteric

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and we will talk about it
later in another episode--

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of the
survivors of lost cultures.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
Vanished civilizations
and their descendants

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
would have found refuge
in the underground world

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to later rise up as the new
spiritual heroes or founders

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.099 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The fact that all this mystery
relates to the underworld

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that
it's the same thing.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Just like when we
talk about the stars,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
there may be multiple
civilizations

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:90%
that come from the cosmos.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But not necessarily all of
them have the same lineage

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:90%
or the same history.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens
in the underground world.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Regarding Dr. Vallee and
Paola Harris's investigations,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity
to be in the same place

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to visit this entire
area near Socorro,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:84%
New Mexico to speak
to Mr. Padilla,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the original witness
in the case of the ship

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.315 align:middle line:84%
that had crashed in 1945,
when he was a small child.

00:17:55.315 --> 00:17:58.155 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.155 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I have held in my
hands the piece

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that they recovered from the
object that crashed there.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I've talked with Dr.
Vallee and Paola Harris

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.540 align:middle line:90%
about this incident.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusions
were that the incident

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
occurred, that something
crashed there in New Mexico.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:84%
They have no explanation,
not only for the object,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but also for the creatures
that Padilla saw.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:84%
When I asked Dr.
Vallee, who has usually

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:84%
been seen by ufology as a
skeptic, if he believes Padilla

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and that he saw those beings,
Dr. Vallee clearly told me yes.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
He does not doubt the testimony
of the contact witnesses,

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
only that he has an
alternative theory

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to explain them,
that maybe the phenomenon isn't

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
always extraterrestrial,
that it could come

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%
from an unknown intelligence.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is how our
psyche processes all that.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:90%
But that's another matter.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.380 align:middle line:84%
The specific case
of George Adamski

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:90%
warrants wide reflection.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It is useful for us to
understand the modus operandi

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:84%
of the alleged extraterrestrial
envoys in this atomic context.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Adamski was an American
citizen of Polish origin.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
He was a soldier in the 13th
cavalry regiment fighting

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
on the Mexican border
against the raids

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.120 align:middle line:90%
by the infamous Pancho Villa--

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:90%
incredible.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
But his spiritual and
esoteric concerns,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:84%
a detail to keep in mind,
took him down another path.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And so he founded, in the
1930s, a fact that few cite,

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:90%
the Royal Order of Tibet.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
That mystical, esoteric
stage, not widely publicized

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.100 align:middle line:84%
in Adamski's life,
could be considered

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.390 align:middle line:84%
a type of preparation for the
contacts he would later face,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
as Marla did in
her day in Mexico

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.100 align:middle line:84%
before having her
extraterrestrial contact

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Returning to Adamski, in
1940, he moved with his wife

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to a ranch in Monte
Palomar, California,

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:84%
a property which they
would call Palomar Gardens.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:84%
There, perhaps inspired by
the proximity of the Palomar

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Observatory, he
deepened his passion

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:84%
for the cosmos and stargazing
through his six-inch telescope.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
From there, on October 9, 1946,
the first sighting occurred.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
While Adamski and
a group of friends

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.930 align:middle line:84%
scrutinized a meteor
shower, they caught on film

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
a tubular-shaped UFO, a
cigar-looking, elongated

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:84%
object, which later
became popular in ufology

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:84%
as the typical mothership
or carrier ship.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Over time, Adamski's
new observations

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.410 align:middle line:84%
would include extraordinary
photographic proof,

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:84%
which opened up the debate
between the believers

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in his experience and
the critics, the latter

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.090 align:middle line:84%
being the ones who said that the
amateur astronomer photographed

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
vacuum cleaner lids and oil
lamps to make his followers

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:90%
believe in extraterrestrials.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
In addition, his
detractors also alleged

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that the contact
witness's writings

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:07.630 align:middle line:84%
had suspicious coincidences with
science fiction, which is true.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:10%
You just have to look through
the fantastic publications

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:10%
on this subject from the '30s
to realize that people already

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.575 align:middle line:10%
believed in flying saucers.

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Were alleged contact
witnesses inspired by those

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle line:84%
publications to make up alleged
extraterrestrial experiences?

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe these beings
could have used

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:84%
elements of popular culture
to introduce themselves

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
to witnesses using those
same shapes or appearances.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:10%
I wonder, is it possible
that science fiction

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:10%
could be a memory of the
future and not imagination?

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Or do extraterrestrials
read our science fiction?

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Or is our science fiction
based on extraterrestrials?

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:10%
I must say that for
important scientists who

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:10%
delved into the study
of the UFO phenomenon

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:10%
like the renowned astrophysicist
who I already mentioned,

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:10%
Josef Allen Hynek, who was also
a military advisor to the US

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle line:10%
Air Force, and his friend,
scientist and French ufologist

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:10%
Jacques Vallee, Adamski,
for them, was a fraud.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Little credence was given
to Adamski's descriptions

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
based on his alleged
extraterrestrial experiences

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Van Allen
radiation belt before it

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:84%
was made known publicly in 1958,
nor that Kodak had certified

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
some of his UFO footage as
authentic such as the Silver

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Springs case of 1965
in order to spin

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:90%
the opinion of his detractors.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it would
be a long list--

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
many ups and downs in this case.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
On the Adamski case,
I had the opportunity

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to track his first data, still
unpublished information--

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and this thanks to the
kindness of Glenn Steckling

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Adamski
Foundation, whom I

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:84%
interviewed in the
city of San Diego

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States in California.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:10%
And he told me something
very interesting,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:10%
that Adamski's purpose was
to share a message that

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:10%
would affect the consciousness
of people, something

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:10%
very similar to what has
happened to other contact

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:10%
witnesses in Latin America,
that his intention was not

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:10%
exactly to convince the military
that he had experiences--

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:10%
even though he provided
them with videos,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:10%
photographs of the contacts he
had recorded with his camera--

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:10%
despite the opinion
of his detractors.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:84%
What Adamski intended was a
change of the consciousness

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Because it was what
Orthon tried to tell him

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
in that close encounter
at Desert Center,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
that we were transmitting a very
dark, very dangerous frequency

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:90%
due to our behavior.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Later, Adamski understood.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But above all, due to
the experiments being

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
done at that time with nuclear
weapons, that same message--

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and I want to
specifically emphasize

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
this-- was received by Eugenio
Siragusa and other contact

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:90%
witnesses in the world.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, World War II had concluded.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:84%
A very dark period had
begun called the Cold War.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And many messages, many
experiences at that time

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
seemed to concentrate
on the danger

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
of World War III, if it could
happen, and atomic weapons.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't just weapons.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:90%
It was base human behavior.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.160 align:middle line:90%
And to this day--

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
we are filming this
program in 2022--

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.320 align:middle line:84%
we have not changed a lot
compared to the Cold War.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We have other types of weapons,
other kinds of problems.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrials
are still on alert

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:90%
due to human behavior.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.660 align:middle line:84%
However, just as
in Adamski's day,

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.840 align:middle line:84%
they continue to trust that
human beings in the end

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
will be able to overcome
all these difficult stages

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.440 align:middle line:90%
of learning.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Many people tell me,
well, but those close

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
encounters after World War
II at the end of the 1940s,

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.240 align:middle line:90%
it's been so long.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's been so difficult.
Why don't these beings

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:90%
openly show themselves?

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
For us, decades have passed--
more than half a century.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
For them, it was just
five minutes ago.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
things with that perspective.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, it's not
that they can't intervene.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:90%
They can.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:90%
But they shouldn't.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:84%
If not, they would
be interfering

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.810 align:middle line:84%
with human free will, a will
which, despite everything, I

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:90%
still believe in.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
However, while all
these controversies

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
accused and
condemned Adamski, he

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
was still generating
interest and started

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to receive confidential
visits from US military staff.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.190 align:middle line:84%
In addition, he was interviewed
by influential people

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
of his time like Queen
Juliana of Holland

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and, supposedly, by Pope John
XXIII himself in the Vatican.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Why did he fascinate
these individuals?

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Adamski passed at the
age of 74 of a heart attack

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:90%
on April 25, 1965.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, and
not a minor detail,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.190 align:middle line:84%
he was buried in the cemetery
of national heroes in Arlington,

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Virginia--

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
a distinction for his
brief time as a soldier

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:90%
or for another unknown reason?

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I have no hesitation
in pointing out

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that one of the most debatable
episodes in the Adamski case

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.520 align:middle line:84%
were his physical
face-to-face encounters

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials with
human features like those

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:90%
who we have also met.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
wanted to get to.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
That first contact,
that of Adamski,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.430 align:middle line:84%
occurred in Desert Center
in the state of California.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.220 align:middle line:84%
It was November 20,
1952 when George Adamski

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:56.730 align:middle line:84%
saw there a being with Nordic
features whom he called Orthon.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
entity's real name.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:90%
Adamski called him that.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And this close encounter before
six witnesses, among them

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.460 align:middle line:84%
was US explorer and
anthropologist George Hunt

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Williamson.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:10%
Adamski, in his book,
"The Flying Saucers Have

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:10%
Landed," published
in 1953, which

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:10%
he wrote with eccentric
Anglo-Irish investigator

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:10%
Desmond Leslie,
describes that Orthon

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.190 align:middle line:10%
made him understand that
his arrival was friendly

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:middle line:10%
and that the extraterrestrials
were concerned

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.840 align:middle line:10%
with the radiation
coming from Earth

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:10%
due to the huge radioactive
clouds resulting

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.613 align:middle line:10%
from atomic bombs.

00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It should be said that
this close encounter is

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
similar to a scene from the film
"The Day the Earth Stood Still"

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
from 1951, where a human
extraterrestrial, Klaatu,

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.180 align:middle line:84%
descends from a ship accompanied
by his 10-foot-tall robot named

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Gort.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Their mission was to deliver
an ultimatum to humanity

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.600 align:middle line:84%
for it to cease to
use nuclear weapons.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics think this is
a suspicious coincidence

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
of Adamski's supposed
meeting with Orthon, very

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.790 align:middle line:84%
similar things reflecting
upon my own contact

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:84%
experiences, what I have
been able to discuss

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:19.350 align:middle line:84%
with other witnesses across the
world who I've met personally

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:84%
in so many countries
and connecting

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
all of this with what Adamski
experienced at that time

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.570 align:middle line:84%
with Orthon and other entities,
I find a common thread--

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:84%
first, that these beings
did not act freely.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.300 align:middle line:84%
That is, Orthon was
part, as well as

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
other entities that
we have met, of

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial organization
that had methodically

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:49.220 align:middle line:84%
planned these close encounters
with several witnesses who,

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.245 align:middle line:84%
on one hand, are
highly credible but who

00:28:52.245 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
have had their
misgivings about sharing

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:84%
their experiences
with the public

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and with everyday witnesses,
as was the case with George

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Adamski or even
ours, the same modus

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
operandi so that, as I
have always mentioned,

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.460 align:middle line:84%
through a critical
mass of ordinary people

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.770 align:middle line:84%
who have had these
same experiences,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:84%
social pressure
can be generated so

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.170 align:middle line:84%
that highly credible
witnesses may finally speak.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And we are seeing that today at
this time in the 21st century,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
when those who most
denied the subject--

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:84%
fighter pilots, the
military, and scientists--

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:84%
are talking about encounters
with these beings.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about UFO sightings.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
pilots' experiences

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of
human intelligence

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
who have interacted with
them during UFO sightings.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And now that's happening.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.810 align:middle line:84%
That is, everything
that beings like Orthon

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:51.610 align:middle line:84%
planted in witnesses
such as Adamski today

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:84%
has yielded its fruits and let
the chips fall where they may,

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:90%
no matter the consequences.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that Adamski
was not the only one contacted

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
by these beings with
human features who

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.640 align:middle line:84%
came with the same message
of alarm, a message

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.790 align:middle line:84%
that these beings have
unsuccessfully delivered,

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%
especially to
military high command.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It was then that these
envoys of those other worlds

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:24.310 align:middle line:84%
began to intensify their
approach of common witnesses.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.980 align:middle line:84%
This gives rise to what
I call the classical age

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
contact witnesses.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.010 align:middle line:84%
In this modern
era, of course, we

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
are talking about a period
covering from 1945 to 1975.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:84%
We have already mentioned
some of the names.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
Siragusa in Europe,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.110 align:middle line:84%
George Van Tassel,
Daniel Walter Fry,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Howard Menger, Enrique
Castillo Rincon,

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Maria Del Socorro Perez--

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
or Marla-- brothers Carlos
and Sixto Paz Wells,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.750 align:middle line:84%
among others, from all these
experiences, messages of alert

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.630 align:middle line:84%
were issued, different
messages of possibilities

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
for a future that could
take a different shape

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.220 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the increasing
consciousness of human beings.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:10%
But I must also say that
some UFO cults have also

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:10%
emerged from all this.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Because since this has already
happened in the distant past,

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.210 align:middle line:84%
contact witnesses and
people who get caught up

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:84%
in these experiences
begin to see these beings

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.990 align:middle line:84%
as cosmic benefactors
of humanity.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And they go a bit
out of control.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:84%
The perception of common
sense can become a little lost

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.350 align:middle line:84%
after these
experiences, which are

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:90%
very difficult to assimilate.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, some
of these experiences

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:84%
have been stretched
to be applied

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to other beliefs and
religious spheres.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And that made some of the
more orthodox investigators

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:84%
like those we mentioned,
Jacques Vallee or Dr. Hynek,

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:84%
take a critical
stance on what was

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:90%
happening in contact groups.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
However, if we analyze one
thing at a time, at the root,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
we find real
contact experiences,

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
an authentic phenomenon
that can only

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
be understood through the
testimony of contact witnesses.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.010 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Hynek said, we
do not investigate UFOs.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We investigate the
testimonies of people

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:90%
who affirm to have seen them.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:84%
We investigate the
human experience,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
a phenomenon that we
still cannot comprehend.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt that the
messages and information

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of these beings also go
through the filter of contact

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:90%
witnesses.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And from there arise
the distortions.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, contact
with these beings

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.120 align:middle line:84%
has followed a
very long timeline

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.260 align:middle line:84%
from very ancient times where we
could even have construed them

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.280 align:middle line:84%
as angels, gods, fairies,
any supernatural activity

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.930 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't understand.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:56.770 align:middle line:84%
This led some scholars to assume
that in reality, we didn't even

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.290 align:middle line:84%
have contact with
extraterrestrials

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and that our psyche
was attempting

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to place a label on it as if
an unknown type of intelligence

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:84%
interacted with us,
and over time, it

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:90%
was labeled by our culture--

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the genie and the lamp,
any apparition of Mary,

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.250 align:middle line:90%
or modern extraterrestrials.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:10%
Even within contact cases, there
is a very important discussion

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:10%
about the different
Grey-looking beings,

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.580 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps they may not all
be biological beings or robots,

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.430 align:middle line:10%
as I have already
mentioned, but that they

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.520 align:middle line:10%
could be another type of
creature of similar appearance.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:10%
And it is a very complex
issue to address for which

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.340 align:middle line:10%
we do not have total certainty.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is that the
contacts that we affirm to have

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:90%
had--

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and I think that this is also
the case of George Adamski--

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:84%
were contacts with
actual entities

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.610 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:84%
We cannot lump together all
the cases of close encounters

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.040 align:middle line:84%
in the same theory of the
psyche, or hallucinations,

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.580 align:middle line:84%
or folklore, or an unknown
element that is mutating

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to us.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:84%
There were contacts with
extraterrestrial beings

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that formed part of an
advanced civilization who

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
have tried to convey a
message and information.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, with time,
they have been adapting.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
Before, when we didn't
have this technology

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:84%
to capture images
of their objects,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:84%
when we didn't have so
many satellites in space,

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.480 align:middle line:90%
they made more contact.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And now that we have developed
technology to the degree

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
that anyone has a good camera
to record on their cell

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:84%
phone, their mobile
phone, it seems

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
like they are being more
careful in the way that they

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:90%
are approaching us.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
They exhibit that
elusive behavior.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said,
they're waiting for humans

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to advance without any
type of direct intervention

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:90%
that may hinder their learning.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.370 align:middle line:90%
They keep adapting.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.010 align:middle line:90%
But they are still among us.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Now I wonder, could some of
the most famous prophecies

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of the religious world
have arisen from contact

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials?

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that these
beings manifested themselves

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
once again in what is called
the modern age of UFOs

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.920 align:middle line:84%
to warn us that we are playing
with fire with a technology

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that could be self-destructive
for the human species

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and which has already
been tried in the past?

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Did they live with us
thousands of years ago?

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Adamski, Siragusa,
or Daniel Walter Fry

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.000 align:middle line:84%
were not the first
contact witnesses.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon has been
happening for a very long time,

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.560 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And we will go into greater
detail in the next chapter.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez Corpancho.

See you again soon on the
journey of "The Arc of Time."
