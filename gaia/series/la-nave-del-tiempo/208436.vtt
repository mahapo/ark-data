00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this program,
we've analyzed the contact

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
experiences with
non-human intelligences.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Cases such as
Parravicini in Argentina

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:84%
or George Adamski
in the United States

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:90%
are still open files in ufology.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible to enter into
communication with these beings

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:90%
through your own initiative?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Are there preparation
protocols preparing

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:90%
for an encounter with them?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk first about
the classic typology

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:90%
of close encounters.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Many will remember the famous
film, "Close Encounters

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Third Kind."

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
A 20-year-old
Steven Spielberg was

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:84%
making known the
contact experiences

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:84%
that he had investigated--
perhaps the US Air

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Force and other scholars--
through a science fiction film.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.420 align:middle line:10%
However, he was advised by
many of these researchers,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:10%
among them one who
we already mentioned,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:10%
Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an
American astrophysicist who

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:10%
was an advisor to the
United States Air Force

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:10%
to investigate sightings of
unidentified flying objects.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It was precisely Hynek who
created the famous typology

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
of close encounters in three
categories that describe

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:90%
the event and the witness.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
In the first place, we'll
talk about the sighting--

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the close encounter
of typology one,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
when an unidentified
object appears and is

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
observed by one
or more witnesses.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it can
be photographed.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it can be filmed.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And it would be a first
approach-- the UFO sighting.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But then there is
a closer approach.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
That is within typology
two of the close encounters

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
from Dr. Hynek.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
In this case, some
scholars consider

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that this is the landing,
the marks, footprints

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
in the field associated
with the UFO sighting

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:90%
when it lands or takes off.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.010 align:middle line:84%
These important signs
are left in the place

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:90%
where it has manifest itself.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Other scholars, in
fact, also associate

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
paranormal or strange
phenomena that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:84%
could be related to the
approach of the object.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
For example, if a
person is at home

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
and has that irrepressible
feeling to go to the park

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
outside of the
house and suddenly

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
observes the object and animals.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:10%
Pets start barking, leaves
fall off the trees--

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:10%
that type of phenomena is so
typical in close encounters.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
This would also include
category two from Dr. Hynek.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But category three, the
one that lends its name

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to Steven Spielberg's film,
is a lot more disturbing

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
because we are no longer just
in the proximity of an object,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220 align:middle line:84%
but also crew, occupants,
beings, entities

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:90%
associated with the sighting.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
The close encounter
of the third kind--

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
contact with these
beings, whoever they are.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, all this has
led to a great discussion

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
in ufology--

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
if these beings correspond
to extraterrestrial entities,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
operating vehicles
with technology

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
that escapes our
imagination that

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:90%
evasively appear in our skies.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And on very rare occasions,
they have landed,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and they have been observed
by multiple witnesses.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Like the case of the
famous policeman,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Lonnie Zamora in Socorro,
which was the case that

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
convinced Dr. Hynek that
something very extraordinary

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we are
facing another type

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
of beings that are
not necessarily

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial entities.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is another hypothesis
for close encounters--

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that they possibly
could be creatures

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that come from the
underground world,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%
from intraterrestrial bases.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Entities that have
developed in silence,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:84%
while humans on the surface
weren't aware of them.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Others talk about
interdimensional creatures

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:84%
that could be crossing
over from other dimensions,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
from other realities, and
manifesting themselves

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:90%
in our time.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And more than a few
consider, as Dr. Hynek also

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:84%
contemplated in his day, as
well as Dr. Jacques Vallée,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
that they were only
holograms-- that there

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:90%
was nothing physical.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:84%
That an unknown
intelligent phenomenon

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
managed to slip into the psyche
of those contact witnesses,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
making them believe that
they were seeing vehicles

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and that they were seeing
occupants of the alleged UFOs.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But here I wonder,
how can we interpret

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
cases of these objects that
have been photographed, filmed?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
That have left
marks on the ground

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
with very high
temperatures, where

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
samples have been
studied and certified

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
by leading laboratories?

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Fighter pilots, combat-trained
pilots from the United States

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and other nations
of the Earth, who

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.920 align:middle line:84%
have seen these objects
recorded on radar

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:90%
moving at supersonic speeds?

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that, by chance, a hologram?

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Does this fit the
hallucination theory?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that in the case
of close encounters,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a little
bit of everything.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
multi-source hypothesis.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1977, Uruguayan ufologist
who resided in Argentina,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Fabio Zerpa, one of the
pioneers of UFO research

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America
since the 1960s,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:84%
had participated in a
conference in that year, 1977,

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:90%
in Acapulco, Mexico.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.440 align:middle line:84%
He was accompanied by
other great scholars,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
among whom I could mention
Antonio Rivera, Dr.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Hynek himself, and
Jacques Vallée,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and some contact witnesses such
as Enrique Castillo Rincón.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
It was then that Fabio
Zerpa suggested to Dr. Hynek

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that this typology of close
encounters should be expanded,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
not stuck to the
classic three moments--

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
sighting, landing, and
the face to face meeting

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
with the alleged crew
members of the UFO.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
They should add a typology
for close encounters

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that allow the witness
to be taken away

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
inside the
extraterrestrial ship--

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
famous cases such
as, for example,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the controversial
Betty and Barney Hill.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The Hills in 1961 were carried
by some strange creatures

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
inside a UFO, and they
lost their memories

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of that experience until
they could recover them

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:84%
through hypnosis, thanks
to Dr. Benjamin Simon.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Or the case of Travis
Walton in the Arizona forest

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
in the 1970s.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.330 align:middle line:84%
They are close encounters of the
fourth type because the witness

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%
was inside the ship.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was Fabio Zerpa who said
at that congress in Acapulco

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in 1977 in Mexico to Dr.
Hynek that there should also

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:90%
be a typology number five.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Close encounters
of the fifth kind

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
telepathy-- communication

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
through consciousness--
since Zerpa had investigated

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
several cases such as the one
cited, Castillo Rincón, where

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
there was a telepathic protocol
of witness preparation,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.480 align:middle line:84%
a protocol of intent,
frequency, and vibration.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Although this sounds
very mystical,

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
it allowed for the creation
of the best communication

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:84%
conditions and contact
with the extraterrestrials.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we're
talking about communication

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials for
purposes of friendly approach,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
as has been in our
case and the others

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
that we have been discussing
throughout this program.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a little of
everything in the universe

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and there are
multiple cases that

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
have occurred on our
planet, the typology

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth kind
proposed by Zerpa

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is comprised of
psychic preparation,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
telepathic and
extrasensory communication,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
to get closer to the
extraterrestrials.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
I emphasize and reiterate,
he proposed this in 1977

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
at the Acapulco
conference in Mexico.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
That typology of the
fourth and fifth kind

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
is known as the Zerpa
classification--

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
something that is not well
known in North American ufology,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
but which now is
being spoken of,

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:84%
maybe due to empirical evidence
through field experimentation,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
which correspond to
close encounters.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.890 align:middle line:84%
As you may recall in
previous episodes,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:84%
we have referred to the case
of Maria del Socorro Perez,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Marla, who has had
extraordinary experiences

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
since the late 1960s.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But her case began to
become known in 1972.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Her group also followed
a telepathic preparation

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
based on training of the
mind through concentration

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
techniques, meditation,
all types of exercises

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
to promote the development
of the consciousness

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to enter into
communication with entities

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
I will admit that
when investigating

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
these issues of consciousness,
telepathy, meditation, even

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
mantra techniques or
vocalization of power words--

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
sound techniques
to harmonize groups

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
of people who intended on
initiating communication

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials--

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I recognized that it
made me a little wary.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this was
taking the investigation

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of UFO phenomenon and the
extraterrestrial hypothesis

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
too far toward a mystic
experience, which could give

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:90%
rise to all types of confusion.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
What does telepathy,
spirituality,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
this type of practice have to do
with contact with civilizations

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:90%
from other worlds?

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I experienced this
firsthand when in Peru, I

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:84%
investigated different
close encounters

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
in the desert of Chilca, a very
special place of contact that

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
became well known in 1974
thanks to Spanish journalist JJ

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Benítez, who had
participated in a scheduled

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
sighting with the Rahma
group that I mentioned,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and is perhaps the most
important contact movement

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.480 align:middle line:90%
in the history of Latin America.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
They, as well as Marla
and Castillo Rincón,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:84%
participated in some
protocol of close encounters

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.790 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth kind--

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the telepathy, meditation,
raising the frequency,

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
attempting to make contact
with beings from other worlds.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It was then in the
field and practice

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that I was
prejudiced, that I was wrong,

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and I actively participated
in these kinds of experiences.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that when the
group on the field trips

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:84%
was more united, more sensitive,
calmer, in perfect balance,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:84%
all this was achieved through
coexistence, through meditation

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
practice, with the positive
intention of attempting

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.930 align:middle line:90%
communication with the universe.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:84%
This is when the
experiences flowed better.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is
not an "abracadabra."

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not something magical
that any person who

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
practices these techniques will
be guaranteed a close encounter

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:90%
with these beings.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they, too,
have their agendas.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
They also have their purposes.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And they know that their
contact with ordinary witnesses

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:90%
like us is very complex.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It is very difficult, and they
try not to intervene directly

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:84%
in our personal
matters so as to not

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.210 align:middle line:84%
cause any problems, personal
or social, with human beings.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.480 align:middle line:84%
They are looking for
people with resilience,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
able to adapt and not stick
to just the phenomenon

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
or experiences, but who dare
to share their testimony,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:90%
as we are doing right now.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Not to convince you that
these contacts and close

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
encounters are real, but
to invite other people who

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:84%
felt alone or ridiculed
for having faced

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:84%
these contacts to feel
supported and generate,

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
as I've already said, a critical
mass of consciousness, which

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
prepares the best
contact conditions.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:84%
My tribute goes out to my
dear friend Fabio Zerpa, who

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
has already passed,
because he was

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
the one who invented the
term "close encounters

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth kind."

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
are many protocols

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
for contact,
different techniques

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and different systems
of understanding

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:90%
how these experiences occur.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I have widely addressed
it in my books.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But in this episode,
I will speak

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:90%
of four important pillars.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
important protocol.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
resonance protocol.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It is based, according
to the messages

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrials
themselves,

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:47.140 align:middle line:84%
on the equation light,
form, and sound.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
This equation allows
the contact witness

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to generate a field
of ideal coherence

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
to face these experiences
and close encounters.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
In the first
instance, it could be

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
limited to mental experiences,
holographic experiences, which

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:84%
we will talk about
in a few moments.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And in other episodes,
much more intense

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
face to face contacts,
which could even

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
imply the physical
approach of these beings.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
This equation of
light, form, and sound

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
is not much different
from old Eastern teachings

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that describe light as thought,
the light of the mind--

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
shinta, deep thought, some
Eastern scholars would say.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The form could be
related to the structure,

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:84%
to visualization practices
with geometry exercises,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:84%
or even though this sounds
strange or very different,

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.130 align:middle line:84%
practices involving certain
positions of the human body,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
or some gestures known
in the East as mudras--

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
gestures of power to
somehow fuse or manipulate

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
forms of energy
and consciousness.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And finally, sound,
which can be achieved

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
with mantras or other
techniques which

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I have seen in the field--

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
people harmonizing experiences
in the field with sound

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
bowls or even with some
native instruments,

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:84%
as if it were a
shamanic ceremony.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:84%
In that vein, on my
expeditions around the world,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
when I have lived with different
Native groups or shamans,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:84%
they confessed to me to
have observed bright objects

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that approached
them, interacted with them,

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that gave off large beams
of light like flashes

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:84%
when they were
singing, when they

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
were reciting their
mantras, or even when

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
they were dancing and playing
some kind of instrument.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of the film that
I mentioned, "Close Encounters

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Third Kind."

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Surely you will not
have forgotten the scene

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:90%
in Dharamshala in India.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of the
film, a lot of people

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
were chanting a
mantra, and they had

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
learned the sound,
the frequency,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.373 align:middle line:84%
the vibration emitted by
the ship they had observed.

00:16:09.373 --> 00:16:11.998 align:middle line:84%
That sound, the famous [HUMMING
THEME FROM "CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF

00:16:11.998 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
THE THIRD KIND"] dun,
dun, dun, dun, dun,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
which was transformed
into a mantra,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
ended up being the anthem of
that famous film by Steven

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Spielberg.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Then the extraterrestrials
and their communications

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
suggested that in order to
reach extraordinary states

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness as a
means of communication

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
with them and
other realities, we

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.670 align:middle line:84%
had to work on this frequency
of light, form, and sound.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was done through
meditation, concentration,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
visualization techniques
of geometric shapes

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that were suggested, in
fact, by these beings.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Such as, for example, the
hypercube or the tesseract,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
which in his day, English
mathematician Charles Howard

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Hinton called a contact route
with the fourth dimension.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
In a book he published at
the end of the 19th century,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:84%
he even asked his
students to try

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to visualize the
tesseract in movement

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:84%
as a method of mental
training to promote

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:90%
the awakening of the mind.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:90%
So all these techniques--

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:90%
light, form, and sound--

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
have been applied by contact
groups for many decades.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that in
the United States,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
you are trying to study all
this and apply it in the field.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But in Latin America,
these experiences

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.305 align:middle line:84%
have been happening for
almost half a century.

00:17:32.305 --> 00:17:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:84%
As a footnote on the
mystery of the hypercube,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
as we have spoken
on occasion, we

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
live in a universe
of three dimensions.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Humans are in a universe in our
perception of three dimensions,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:90%
which are not the only ones.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:90%
There are higher dimensions.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Physics understands
these dimensions

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
as measurements--
length, width, and depth.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
would be time.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, objects that move
in a fourth or fifth dimension

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
are difficult to process, if
not impossible, in more sensible

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
terms by the human
mind, which is

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
confined to the aforementioned
third dimension.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when the figure of
the hypercube or tesseract

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:84%
emerged, which is a
three-dimensional cube

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:84%
projected in the
fourth dimension.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The tesseract, however,
is the reflection,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the shadow of what a
hypercube would probably

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:90%
be like in a fourth dimension.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
A hypercube in the
fourth dimension

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is impossible to
recreate in our brain,

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
but we can see its reflection,
its likeness, like its shadow

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:90%
in our reality.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And that would be the hypercube.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
As suggested by
Charles Howard Hinton,

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:84%
with the visualization
of the hypercube,

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Ivica and Antarelle,
extraterrestrial beings

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:84%
who have entered
into communication

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:84%
with different contact
groups, suggested

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:84%
working with the
hypercube figure

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
through a
visualization exercise.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
visualization of the hypercube
in a movement technique

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:84%
is how this figure evolves
into a dynamic in your mind,

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to activate secret
circuits in your consciousness

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
to get closer to an
extraordinary state

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this hypercube
visualization technique

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:84%
in mental meditation
exercises is

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
what has trained at certain
times contact groups

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to attempt
telepathic communication

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.060 align:middle line:84%
or even making their
own trip through time.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
To all this, when we speak
of extraordinary states

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
some achieve it

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:84%
through meditation,
concentration,

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
spiritual discipline,
visualization

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of geometric figures.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
We just mentioned the
case of the hypercube.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Also, through some very
intense experiences

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
that can generate those
extraordinary states

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness--

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
nature, water, the sun's
rays, contemplation,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:90%
including a terminal illness--

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
there are different stimuli that
can precipitate these states.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But contact experiences
and their protocols

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:84%
suggest the techniques
of meditation

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
and inner discipline.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to attempt
contact with the universe

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:84%
if you don't at least attempt
to be in contact with yourself,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
since the most important
close encounter affirmed

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
by these beings is not with
the stars, but with ourselves?

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.770 align:middle line:84%
In my coexistence with
different indigenous

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:84%
groups, shamans,
healers with whom

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I have been able to talk
about extraterrestrial contact

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and their experiences,
they, too,

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:84%
have achieved an extraordinary
state of consciousness

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
after, for example,
consuming sacred plants.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:84%
A very famous case in Peru
is the intake of ayahuasca,

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:90%
the vine of the dead.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And through that
sacred ancestral drink,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
for these jungle
groups particularly,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
they can enter into
extraordinary states

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and connect
with other realities, which

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
has led to a great discussion
among specialists--

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
psychologists, psychiatrists,
neuroscientists--

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
if those extraordinary
states of consciousness

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
penetrate into other unknown
dimensions or other archetypes

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that dwell in the subconscious
of each individual.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:10%
A fascinating case is that of
Peruvian Pablo Amaringo Shuña,

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:10%
who through ayahuasca observed
these other realities, and in

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:10%
them, according to his
testimony, which he depicted

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:10%
on hundreds of canvases--

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:10%
beautiful paintings.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.170 align:middle line:10%
Flying objects even appear
there similar to UFOs,

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:10%
flying saucers, entities
with human features

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:10%
who, according to him, were
ancestors of the universe

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.920 align:middle line:10%
or guardians of nature.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The question that
we ask ourselves

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
when contemplating these
images is, did Amaringo Shuña

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:84%
have some contact with
extraterrestrial beings,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
with beings of nature, with
interdimensional entities,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.360 align:middle line:90%
through ayahuasca?

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
However, I must add that the
consumption of sacred plants

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:84%
requires great responsibility
and should not generate

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.260 align:middle line:90%
dependence on sacred plants.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.200 align:middle line:84%
At least, that's what I
learned from the great masters

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Andes and of
the jungles in Peru.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They can show you the way,
they can work like an oracle,

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but if you become
dependent on the plant

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and you constantly have
to consume it in order

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:84%
to see your shadows
and follow your path,

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
there is something that
you haven't learned.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.370 align:middle line:84%
The great masters say that
any external experience,

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:84%
be it through sacred
plants or even contact

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
with life forms
that are not human,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.380 align:middle line:84%
like the experiences with
extraterrestrial contact,

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
they must not
generate dependencies.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:10.020 align:middle line:84%
They are just temporary
external stimuli in order

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:90%
for you to find your own way.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And how did the natives
know about these plants?

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:90%
There are many traditions.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Some of them say
that their ancestors

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:84%
had contact with these gods
and that's how they learned.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And others say that
they learned it

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:84%
by connecting with Mother
Earth, with Pachamama.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.240 align:middle line:84%
In any event, it is something
to be taken very seriously,

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of respect and
with a lot of preparation.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I will say that
extraterrestrials

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
in their communications
within the contact protocols

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
suggest techniques that are
based on individual development

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:84%
without depending on
anything external.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, proper
breathing, concentration,

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and meditation with
purpose and frequency

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to get closer to
these other realities

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:84%
is the backbone
of contact groups

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
who worked with close
encounters of the fifth kind

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in Latin America, as I said,
for almost half a century.

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.860 align:middle line:84%
The second protocol
is telepathy.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, communication
with these beings

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
goes through mental
pathways, but it's not

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:84%
that the contact witness
is a born telepath,

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:84%
like apparently Benjamín
Solari Parravicini was,

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
but these beings
make the greatest

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.060 align:middle line:84%
effort because
they have developed

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:90%
their psychic faculties.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And with an antenna or channel
that has been prepared,

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that has in some
way opened your mind

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
to receive it, they contact
you and transmit a frequency

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:51.510 align:middle line:84%
That frequency information
or energy contains images,

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:84%
contains data that the
brain of the contact witness

00:24:55.470 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
will decode in their own
language or in words.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Within the contact
techniques that

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:84%
are well known in Latin
America that were used back

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
in his day, Enrique Castillo
Rincón, who I mentioned,

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:84%
the Rahma groups in
Peru, or in fact,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.690 align:middle line:84%
as happened in our case,
our psychographics or

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:84%
instrumentalized
telepathy-- that is,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
the witness receives
the telepathic impulse

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and feels the need
to write it down.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is received
is written down in a notebook

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and decoded by the brain.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like I'm getting a
letter from extraterrestrials,

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:84%
even though it sounds
odd, a written message.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is so that it is
not forgotten and can then

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:90%
be analyzed.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:10%
In this telepathic protocol,
the extraterrestrials

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:10%
suggest that the witness be
in a state of meditation,

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:10%
in perfect balance
and equilibrium,

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:10%
and within these
techniques, these beings

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.800 align:middle line:10%
have even suggested, in
their communications,

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.380 align:middle line:10%
that a witness who attempts
them should maintain

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:10%
a healthy physical and
mental lifestyle so

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:10%
that no type of
distortion or interference

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:10%
may be generated in the
message that is being received.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:84%
That is, the witness
be a healthy person

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
without any dependency on
stimulants of any kind that

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:90%
may affect personal balance.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:84%
This is not a minor
issue, because entering

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary states
of consciousness

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
requires physical discipline,
a healthy diet, and being

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:84%
rid of any stimulant that
may affect your psyche,

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.140 align:middle line:84%
let alone drugs or
alcohol or tobacco.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.420 align:middle line:84%
All these things should
be avoided in order

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.910 align:middle line:90%
for better mental preparation.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.760 align:middle line:84%
It is very interesting
because many people who

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.640 align:middle line:84%
have approached these matters
to see if they could have

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.800 align:middle line:84%
some kind of contact
or communication

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.720 align:middle line:84%
with these beings,
what they were doing

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
was disciplining themselves
to lead a healthier life.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to reiterate
that attempting

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
these telepathic
contacts is not something

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that happens automatically,
just by following protocols.

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on the
agenda of these beings.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
We can try, but why do
we want to have contact?

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Are we considering
the consequences?

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Are we willing to face
very complex processes

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
in our personal
context by making

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:90%
known what we have experienced?

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:84%
What good is it for a person to
have these experiences if they

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
can't in some way put them
into practice in something

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that is very useful for
themselves and for others?

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
This is a little of what
these beings transmit

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.470 align:middle line:90%
in their communications.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Once these messages are received
in this telepathic protocol,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
receipt needs to be confirmed,
since the antenna or channel

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
obviously could have some
type of interference.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Prior knowledge,
readings, or emotions

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.810 align:middle line:84%
could distort the
original message

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that these beings
have transmitted.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Within the contact
protocols, these beings

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
suggest confirming the message
through a scheduled contact,

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
especially if the content
is very relevant--

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:84%
that is, they
indicate at what time

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
they might appear through a
sighting with the day and time

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:90%
to verify the contact was made.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:10%
And then the content is
very carefully analyzed

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:10%
through wise judgment, that
the information is such

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:10%
that it can be verified over
time, that it is balanced,

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:10%
that it promotes unity.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Messages that are
convoluted, catastrophic,

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:84%
supposed communications
with religious overtones

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.450 align:middle line:84%
obviously are not messages
from higher beings.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Those could reflect the biases
of the supposed channel who

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.080 align:middle line:84%
categorizes it as an
extraterrestrial message,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's nothing more
than their own beliefs

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that spill into this
supposed communication.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Telepathic messages follow a
strict verification protocol,

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:84%
which must be rigorous
when attempting contact

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:90%
with non-human intelligences.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.890 align:middle line:84%
This is the basic
telepathy protocol

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:16.420 align:middle line:90%
that is used in contact groups.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The interdimensional protocol
is another of the pillars,

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.480 align:middle line:90%
and it is extraordinary.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:84%
These beings have the
ability to concentrate

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:84%
a large amount of energy in one
place and break or distort--

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what terms to use--

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:90%
the concept of space-time.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.970 align:middle line:84%
They concentrate such a
great amount of energy

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that a kind of vortex
opens, which they somehow

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
are able to keep stable
so that the individual may

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:90%
enter into that force.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
In Peruvian contact
experiences, this phenomenon

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is called xendras, a term coined
by the Rahma group I already

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:90%
mentioned--

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional portals.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And according to these
beings, when you already

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:03.490 align:middle line:84%
have gone through the stages
of the sightings, the stages

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
of the mental
contacts, and you are

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.130 align:middle line:84%
more accustomed to
communication with them,

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:84%
the next stage is to enter
inside these domes of energy.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Here you are seeing a
photograph of one of them

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.700 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to photograph
at a contact in the Dominican

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Republic in the
Constanza Mountains.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like a concentration
of bright white energy,

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:90%
23 to 30 feet in diameter.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.540 align:middle line:10%
When you go into
this place, you may

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.970 align:middle line:10%
go through experiences
of a mental nature,

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:10%
holographic, or
even physical, where

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:10%
you would find yourself face
to face with extraterrestrials.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like a field of coherence,
of artificial energy, where

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.460 align:middle line:84%
an interaction may be carried
out with them in a safe manner.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:84%
They usually give notice
when these contacts will

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
be carried out, and obviously,
the same preparation protocol

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:84%
of personal balance,
a healthy diet,

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
are applicable to this
type of experiences

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:84%
due to the high
radiation emitted

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
by these xendras, or
interdimensional portals.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It is a way of
secure communication

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:84%
which only occurs on very
rare circumstances, when

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:90%
they deem necessary.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
In my personal case,
on different occasions,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through these
dimensional steps,

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
which have been a part of
the history of contact cases

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:84%
since the 1950s, but which
have had greater dissemination

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the experiences
recorded in Peru, especially

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.590 align:middle line:90%
in the Chilca Desert.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We were going out
into the desert.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:90%
These objects appeared.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:84%
They flew over the camp
with a lot of flashes coming

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.850 align:middle line:84%
from them, as if they were
lightning bolts in a storm,

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in an area where, by the
way, it doesn't rain.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a desert.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
These flashes, or this
artificial lightning,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:84%
came from these shiny objects
and lit up the ground.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, though, this
light, as if it had density,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.420 align:middle line:90%
was concentrating.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It was coming
together and making

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.250 align:middle line:90%
a kind of bright crescent moon.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
At that time, by telepathic
suggestion, mental instructions

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:84%
from these beings, we set
aside any technological device

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that we had with us or anything
metallic-- mobile phones,

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:90%
watches, cameras.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:90%
We had to leave them in camp.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were just walking,
obviously with our clothing,

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:84%
without any devices or
metals, at their suggestion.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I suppose that's because
of the field of radiation

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.960 align:middle line:84%
from this xendra,
interdimensional portal,

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it was.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:90%
And then we went in there.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:38.380 align:middle line:84%
We actually felt very intense
energies in our bodies.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We felt a type of
headache at first, nausea.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Some people even--

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling it here on
camera without any kind

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:90%
of apprehension--

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.170 align:middle line:84%
some decided to ignore
the recommendations

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrials,
and they

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.270 align:middle line:84%
hadn't followed the prior
preparation for nutrition,

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:59.170 align:middle line:84%
maintaining a balance,
and they were in a rush,

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:84%
expecting to have
this type of contact

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.030 align:middle line:84%
when they were
inside the xendras.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
They had a breakdown.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:90%
They felt ill.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Some even vomited or had to
leave the energy because they

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.400 align:middle line:90%
couldn't handle it.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And the people who had
followed a diet accordingly,

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:84%
who came in with a
different consciousness,

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.980 align:middle line:84%
not seeking an exotic experience
with extraterrestrials

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.410 align:middle line:84%
but with other intentions,
they had a better experience.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Before physically
meeting these beings,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:84%
when they had gotten
close to us, to our camps,

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and we had seen them in the
company of other witnesses,

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.180 align:middle line:84%
I met them with the first
step inside these xendras.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Their images were translucent.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.590 align:middle line:84%
They were bright, as
if I were seeing--

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.120 align:middle line:90%
and in fact, it was--

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:90%
a holographic projection.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a momentous step
for us to get used to them,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.520 align:middle line:84%
what they look like, and have
the first virtual reality

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.025 align:middle line:84%
interaction within
these fields of energy.

00:34:01.025 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the protocol
for physical contact.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.889 align:middle line:84%
You don't always get to
have this experience,

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have much to add
because the preparation is

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.860 align:middle line:84%
much stricter, stricter
than everything

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I've mentioned so far.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
There are cases of people who,
without prior preparation,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.760 align:middle line:84%
have had direct contact
with extraterrestrials.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But to maintain that contact,
that relationship over time,

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:90%
they require preparation.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:39.000 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
beyond physical preparation

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:84%
and mental preparation
with meditation techniques,

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:84%
concentration that I
have already mentioned,

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.250 align:middle line:90%
there is a paradigm shift.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Although it sounds
incredible, we

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:53.909 align:middle line:84%
have to stop seeing these
beings as extraterrestrials,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
like something beyond us.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:59.340 align:middle line:84%
If we start to see them as
intelligent creatures who

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:84%
are part of life in the universe
in which the human species is

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:84%
involved, perhaps we would
start to see this phenomenon

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.580 align:middle line:90%
as a phenomenon.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
We would see it as
something more natural.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The protocol for
physical contact

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.000 align:middle line:90%
comes when the time is right.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.140 align:middle line:84%
The only preparation there is
for these experiences obviously

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.060 align:middle line:90%
is a change in paradigm.

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Then there are details
that these beings control.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.540 align:middle line:84%
If the contact is going to take
place in a remote location,

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.080 align:middle line:84%
usually, so as not to affect
other people who are not

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:84%
part of this process
of experiences,

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:84%
they can do it on a mountain,
in a desert, in a forest,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.630 align:middle line:90%
in a secluded place.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:90%
They follow these protocols.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:84%
They usually point out places
of contact, neutral areas so

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:90%
that experiences can take place.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:50.640 align:middle line:84%
All those variables are
controlled by mutual agreement

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.820 align:middle line:84%
among those who extend the
invitation for the experience

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:90%
and those who accept it.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But the paradigm shift is
the most important thing

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:84%
to have face to face
contact with them,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.690 align:middle line:90%
if that is meant to happen.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And I daresay after having
seen them on several occasions,

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that there is no
protocol that can prepare

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.730 align:middle line:90%
you enough for this experience.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:15.700 align:middle line:90%


00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like going down
a roller coaster.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Even though you know
how the moment will

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
be and the speed of the car,
the roller coaster incline,

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and even though you
know all the details,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:84%
once you are falling in
that great roller coaster,

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:90%
nothing prepared you for that.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:84%
However, it is a
wonderful experience

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.650 align:middle line:84%
if you put it into
perspective, an experience

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
that you will never
forget, an experience

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that must be taken responsibly
and constructively,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.640 align:middle line:84%
because these contacts
obviously have a purpose.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:84%
In regards to these
close encounters

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
with the protocol
for physical contact,

00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
reflect on the fact

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that these beings are attempting
to make friendly connections

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:90%
with our species.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:90%
And it is a gradual process.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why they try to
approach a lone individual

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:90%
or a small group of people--

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't alter the
order of our human society.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.930 align:middle line:84%
They try, as I have said,
for us to stop seeing them

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:84%
as extraterrestrials, and
that our species are united

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:28.740 align:middle line:84%
by many ties, not only
genetic, but also consciousness

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:90%
in an intelligent universe.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.880 align:middle line:84%
For now, they prefer these
contacts with individual women,

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.860 align:middle line:84%
with individual men, with small
groups, not mass contacts,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:84%
because they are in that
anthropological process

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.690 align:middle line:90%
of preparation.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But when human
beings, like I say,

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.870 align:middle line:84%
stop seeing them as something
foreign, instead as part

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.840 align:middle line:84%
of a cosmic family,
maybe we would

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.140 align:middle line:84%
be ready for definitive
contact with civilizations

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.120 align:middle line:90%
from other worlds.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Many scholars of
ufology have explored

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.460 align:middle line:84%
contact protocols and
extraordinary states

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.810 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They consider that
the key for contact

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:84%
with these other realities
is found in the mind.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And, without a doubt, it is.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But I must emphasize
that this tendency

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.060 align:middle line:84%
to study external
stimuli that precipitate

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:84%
those states, like
consuming sacred plants

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
or concoctions with
DMT that stimulate

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland, et cetera,
would be changed to explore

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.910 align:middle line:84%
what human beings can
achieve on their own

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:38.520 align:middle line:84%
through inner discipline,
without the need

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.000 align:middle line:90%
for a magic formula.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a slower path,
without a doubt,

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
but safer and more long
lasting, because it

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.410 align:middle line:90%
contains inner teaching.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is the goal for
contact with these beings.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.740 align:middle line:84%
That said, all the tools
provided by these techniques

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.840 align:middle line:84%
are wonderful, but
they have to be

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%
addressed with appropriate
preparation, respect,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and responsibility.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Contact protocols
and any technique

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that stimulates
those experiences

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
should not be taken as a
kind of spiritual fast food.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.680 align:middle line:84%
As the great masters say, even
the great masters of ayahuasca

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle, you cannot depend
on anything external to acquire

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.740 align:middle line:90%
a vision for yourself.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:84%
The tools are just tools,
and their use is temporary.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Not by chance do
extraterrestrials affirm

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.870 align:middle line:84%
in their messages that the one
main contact is the inner one.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.000 align:middle line:84%
To achieve something
extraordinary,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.960 align:middle line:84%
first we have to achieve the
extraordinary within ourselves.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And that is the real message.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I'll see you in
the next episode.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And on that occasion, we won't
travel towards the stars,

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:56.550 align:middle line:84%
but toward the mysteries of
the intraterrestrial world.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.040 align:middle line:84%
