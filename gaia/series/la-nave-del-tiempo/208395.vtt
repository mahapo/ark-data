00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.000 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Book of
Acts, in the Bible,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.830 align:middle line:10%
it is claimed that in the last
days, humans will prophesy,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.910 align:middle line:10%
that they would have dreams and
they would dream of the future.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10%
Is this possible?

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:10%
Can we humans perceive
possible future events

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:10%
or could someone or
something reveal it to us?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:10%

Welcome aboard,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics think that
prophecies arise

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
from superstition and fear
and that, in short, they

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:90%
do not exist.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And they add that
religions have been

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.960 align:middle line:10%
used as systems of control.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps on this
point, we may agree.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:10%
They also argue that
the prophecies are not

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:10%
always fulfilled, that they
are inaccurate, ethereal,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:10%
and that their content is
at the mercy of whomever

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:10%
interprets them.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I recognize that,
in general, this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
is right, especially with
those predictions that

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:90%
have a cryptic message.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
But are all prophecies a fraud?

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Within the different
predictions,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
is there any evidence of
authentic prophecies that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:90%
would invite us to reflect?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And if that were so,
how does it work?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.760 align:middle line:84%
What or who activates
that gift of prophecy?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, according
to the Royal

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Academy of the Spanish
Language, prophecy

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
is a supernatural
gift that consists

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
of knowing distant
or future things

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:90%
through divine inspiration.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this is a
partial definition and perhaps

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.370 align:middle line:90%
deep-seated in religion.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
If we understand "divine,"
in quotation marks,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
as a manifestation of God
or of spiritual beings

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
before a witness who later
write down their visions, just

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
as different prophets
in the Bible,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
this mystery of the prophets
is actually a lot bigger.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
How should we
interpret the messages

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that come from close encounters
with extraterrestrials

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
or even other types
of experiences

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
like the apparitions of Mary?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Also, not all prophecies
arise from the manifestation

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
of a supernatural divine being.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There are predictions
that are triggered thanks

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
to the psychic
sensitivity of the seer

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
or are released through access
to privileged knowledge, which

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
will then be written
in a coded language

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
only for those
who know the code.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:10%
The world of prophecies,
for this and other reasons,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:10%
is extremely complex
and shies away

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:10%
from those religious
undertones that many

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:10%
have placed on it
due to ignorance

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:10%
and lack of information.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It is important to mention
that for several authors,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.350 align:middle line:84%
there is an important difference
between the terms "prophecy"

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:90%
and "prediction."

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Predicting means announced
by revelation, science,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
or conjecture that something
is going to happen.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
That is, a prophecy would
have a supernatural signature,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and a prediction can be based
on knowledge and deduction.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
On this issue, probably,
the mythical Nostradamus

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
would be a worthy example
of both definitions.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
The French astrologer,
Rosicrucian initiate,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
physician, and clairvoyant could
have written his prophecies

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the access that
he had to secret information

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:84%
that allowed him to
deduce future events.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Nostradamus
contrasted his studies

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
with what he called
the Spirit of Fire,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
his secret supernatural
inspiration.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:10%
Nostradamus, as we will
recall, this great prophet

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.350 align:middle line:10%
of the 16th century,
had several successes,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:10%
such as the emergence of Hitler
himself, his role in World War

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:10%
II, the explosion
of atomic bombs,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:10%
which we mentioned in
the previous episode

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:10%
when we discussed the
problems with Trinity

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:10%
or even the assassination
of President Kennedy

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:10%
or the strange death
of Pope John Paul I.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
However, Nostradamus
went beyond that.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And in a letter that he
left to his son, Cesar,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:90%
he spoke of a cosmic order.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
He implied that all the
things that he had written

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:84%
in a cryptic way were so that
he wouldn't be persecuted,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
so he wouldn't be questioned,
to protect himself

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and so that the information
would reach someone

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:90%
capable of understanding it.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And it hadn't been just his
own work, his inspiration

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:90%
of alleged evidence.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But Nostradamus would have
read that cosmic order,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
a type of celestial geometric
map that any human being can

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:84%
interpret by studying
numbers from a very

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
ancient esoteric astrology, also
from very old manuscripts, that

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
appeared to contain information
about the human psyche

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and how it is interrelated
to information that

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is being experienced in
other planes of reality, what

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
some esoteric sources call
the records of the memory

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
of the universe or
the Akashic records.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
The letter that
Nostradamus leaves his son,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Cesar, is incredible.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:90%
He calls it the cosmic order.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean that any person,
like the great Rosacrucian

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and French doctor
did in his time,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
with this privileged knowledge
could see the possible future?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But if the past and the
present and the future

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
are just illusions,
what is the future?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Consequence of our decisions
or simply variables

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:90%
in a huge cosmic fabric?

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.020 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
case that personally

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
has impressed me more than
that of Nostradamus, himself.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean the prophetic drawings
of Benjamin Solari Parravicini,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
the Nostradamus of the Americas,
the Argentine Nostradamus.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Solari Parravicini was
born in Buenos Aires, August 8,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:90%
1898.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
A son of Buenos
Aires aristocracy,

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:84%
he spent much of his
childhood in his parents'

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
tree-lined villa in the
Palermo neighborhood

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
of the city of Buenos Aires
and North of the city,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
in Vicente Lopez's mansion,
located about 10 kilometers

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:90%
from the capital.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:84%
His family told me that Pelón,
a term of endearment for him,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
had numerous episodes
of abstraction when

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
he played alone as a
young child in the gardens

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:90%
of those properties.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
According to these accounts,
Benjamin Solari Parravicini,

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
as a boy, all of a sudden seemed
to disconnect from everything

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:90%
in those gardens.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the birds
left their nests.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They approached
him without fear,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and they fluttered in
circles around him.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to
communicate with him.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And the disturbing thing
is that in those moments,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:84%
little Benjamin saw and heard
luminous entities, supposed

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
imaginary friends that the
boy called fairies or beings

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:90%
of nature, in his own words.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
As if that were not enough,
later came paranormal phenomena

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:90%
that his family witnessed.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
They observed that
objects in the house

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
would move from one
place to another.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Some very heavy bronze lamps
would levitate off of tables.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They levitated in the
air during those moments

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.905 align:middle line:84%
when Benjamin seemed
to be in a trance.

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Or was there something that
was approaching Benjamin Solari

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Parravicini that was generating
this paranormal activity?

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.230 align:middle line:84%
A fact worthy of mention
is that Benjamin's father,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Pelón's father, Dr.
Benjamin Tomás Solari,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
a renowned psychiatrist
who became a Congressman

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
in Argentina, worried so
much about his child's health

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:84%
when all this began that it
was hard for him to believe.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to him that
it was impossible.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
And without
hesitation, he decided

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to subject his little
son, incredibly,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
to a series of medical
and psychological testing

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to rule out that he was crazy.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
He even asked for a
third-party panel of doctors

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:90%
to do an objective assessment.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:84%
However, he didn't
find any illness.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
The child, little
Benjamin, was healthy.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It was around 1938 that
his prophetic drawings

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:90%
began to become known.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about prophecies
that covered diverse topics,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:10%
such as geopolitics,
possible wars, space travel,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.550 align:middle line:10%
planetary changes, climate
change, and even contact

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrial beings.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to read you some of
his extraordinary predictions.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial beings will
once again arrive on Earth.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:10%
They will arrive in
different spaceships

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:10%
from different
planets, and they will

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:10%
inhabit the mountain craters
of the Andes and Patagonia

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:10%
in the South.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:10%
They will live
together with humans.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:90%
They will be seen and spoken to.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:90%
This prophecy, from 1939.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
This other one says invisible
beings dwell in the world.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Their small ships land
in trees and on houses,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
radiating on human beings
every idea for good.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:90%
This also corresponds to 1939.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:84%
In the face of constant visits
of extraterrestrial ships,

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:84%
science will deny it, then
hesitate, and will finally

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
say it is true.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And our wisdom
has fallen behind.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Centuries watch over
and contemplate us.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
This corresponds
to the year 1940.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
This one here states
extraterrestrial races

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:90%
will return to the Earth.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
They will occupy
underground cities

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:84%
that were once theirs
and still inhabited

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
by their acclimatized
natives, will go down

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to reestablish customs
that were superior to ours

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:90%
but have now disappeared.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
They will manifest
themselves telepathically

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
in the year 2000,
Parravicini affirms

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:90%
in this message from 1959.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
This one here says all starships
are built with materials

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
still unknown on Earth.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
These ships are light, molded
in one piece without any joints.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
The ship owner is also sealed
in a full, seamless SCUBA suit

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and some are even
transparent and blue.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Our hottest fire will
not heat nor pierce

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.090 align:middle line:90%
the material of either.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:90%
1960.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They are very old messages,
even before the modern UFO era.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
It should be noted that these
messages and these descriptions

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of sightings and close
encounters, which

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
are very similar to
the modern experiences

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that all of us different
contact witnesses have had.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps Parravicini was
the first contact witness

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
of that time, since,
as I mentioned,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
he began to receive the first
messages or at least he went

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
public with them in the
decade of the 1930s,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
a time much earlier than
Adamski and the Roswell case.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But where did these
messages come from?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
hypotheses and specialists

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:17.020 align:middle line:84%
in Parravicini's
psychographics do not agree.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Some assume that it
was clairvoyance,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Parravicini's abilities as
a medium to receive messages

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:90%
from other realities.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Other scholars believe
that Parravicini channeled

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
some type of spiritual energy
of people who had already passed

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and who had delivered to the
medium, Parravicini, messages

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and warnings of events
that were going to occur.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of
the psychographics

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
seem to be along that line.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:51.760 align:middle line:84%
However, there are others
who insinuate contact

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials or as if
a non-human intelligence were

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:90%
describing some things.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
In that vein,
Parravicini, himself,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
stated in the late 1960s
that he had a close encounter

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
According to our
research, that contact

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
would have happened
sometime in the year 1961.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
According to the
testimony of Parravicini,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of the
city of Buenos Aires,

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:27.370 align:middle line:84%
a fog or mist came upon him
with a strange personage

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of this
mist, a mist that

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
reminds me of
other contact cases

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
that have been recorded
in unique ufological case

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
histories.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Objects that have the
ability to concentrate light,

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
a dense light,
which I said, looks

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
like a mist that
could correspond

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:84%
to a shortcut, a portal
between dimensions

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
to absorb the witnesses and
take them to another reality.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Also, the case of what are
called light tubes or energy

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
columns, clear and
compact, that can

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
absorb a person and physically
take them inside these vessels.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's what Parravicini
maintains having experienced

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:90%
in the city of Buenos Aires.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Because through the mist, he
was carried inside an object.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:84%
He had lost consciousness,
bearings of the streets

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:90%
and the city.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, he
was inside an object

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:84%
he describes as circular
with human looking beings

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial origin,
as they presented themselves

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he identified
these beings as messengers

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
from Venus, a planet that,
according to our science,

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
it is impossible for
it to hold any kind

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of intelligent civilization,
unless the alleged

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials
from Venus are living

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.180 align:middle line:90%
in another plane of reality.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:84%
To this, I must add
quite a footnote.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Adamski also
interpreted that Orthon,

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
whom he mentioned and he
interviewed in the California

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:90%
desert, came from Venus.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, these beings
told Parravicini

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:90%
we have been following you.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We have been tracking
your behavior,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:90%
and you are telepathic.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And we communicate
through the mind,

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:90%
and we will send you messages.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And among these messages,
there was a very particular

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
disturbing warning
from these beings.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
They told him about a world.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
They told him about an object
of a traveling planet, which is

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:90%
nothing more than an asteroid.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:84%
They called it Kief, which
should not be confused

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:90%
with the capital of Ukraine.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The name or code of that
object is called Kief.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Others know it as Wormwood,
if we base ourselves

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:90%
on the biblical prophecies.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:10%
Other scholars, such as my dear
friend, Spanish journalist,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:10%
JJ Benitez, called it Gog.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials
who contacted Parravicini

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
said that the object was on a
collision course with our world

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and that an impact
with the Earth

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.860 align:middle line:90%
would generate a change in axis.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:84%
They indicated not the date but
certain planetary conditions

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that were going to coincide
with this incident.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:84%
According to our interpretations
of his prophetic drawings,

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:84%
times when the Earth
was going to face

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:32.930 align:middle line:84%
serious armed conflicts,
intense climate change, plagues,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
confusion, social behaviors
very different from those

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:90%
of Parravicini's time.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:90%
He passed away in the year 1974.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:84%
We can understand perfectly that
almost a half-century later,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
our society is very
different from what our dear

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Pelón experienced in his time.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And all these events pointed
to a decadence of a society.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
They pointed to greater
conflicts of coexistence

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:90%
between us.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment,
the dead planet,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.108 align:middle line:10%
the traveling planet
would hit our world.

00:17:08.108 --> 00:17:10.400 align:middle line:10%
Here, we are looking at some
of the psychographics that

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.530 align:middle line:10%
mention that impact, which would
occur somewhere in the Atlantic

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:10%
Ocean.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Is this a fact that
we can't change?

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to
happen inevitably?

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a
warning, a warning

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to correct so that human beings,
in some way, by their behavior

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:90%
could activate some mechanisms?

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's call them magical,
divine, supernatural.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what term to use
for these events not to happen

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and for humanity to
get a second chance.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I should add that in addition
to the Argentine Nostradamus,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Parravicini, the
French Nostradamus,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
along with different prophecies
of the Earth, from the Bible

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to what is said by
the Hopi Indians,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:05.260 align:middle line:84%
also refer to the star
or object or this comet,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:84%
of this punishment that
could come from the sky

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:90%
and impact us.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It is a warning that is in
different sources in our world.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.640 align:middle line:90%
It is, in every way, a prophecy.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I wanted to
get to in this current episode.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
According to the
extraterrestrials,

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and here I speak directly
of our personal experience,

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
the prophecies, warning
of future events

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
are just that,
information coordinates

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:90%
to act and change things.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
It is true that the universe
is mathematical, geometric,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and perfect and that
there are things

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:90%
that are already preprogrammed.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that are already

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:90%
designed in a cosmic order.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But free will also
exists, which,

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.310 align:middle line:84%
with greater
consciousness, allows

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
us to interact with
that cosmic order

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and make some changes as
if it were the fine print

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.740 align:middle line:90%
in a big contract.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Nostradamus
said to his son, Cesar,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:90%
to some extent.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
A great cosmic order that
you have to understand,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
which is also what
Parravicini understood.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.567 align:middle line:84%
This is why some prophecies
have chillingly been fulfilled.

00:19:17.567 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are others
that have not yet

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
happened because maybe, we have
bought ourselves some time.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Here, I would like
to explain what

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
we could do, as humans, for
certain astonishing events,

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:33.010 align:middle line:84%
unheard of, such as the impact
of a celestial body, which

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.370 align:middle line:84%
could affect us, a threat
from space, which shouldn't be

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the focus of our attention
because for example, NASA

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
has created a space protection
system for early detection

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.170 align:middle line:84%
of possible objects that
could impact the Earth

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and try to divert them.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a real threat.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Although scientists say
such an event will not

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
occur in the next 10,000
years, you never know.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if the
entire universe

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
were organized around a planet
that is not living properly

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and attracts similar
things to its life.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going
to understand me.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.670 align:middle line:10%
There is information that I
call the Sodom and Gomorrah

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:10%
protocol.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:10%
As you may recall,
three heavenly envoys,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:10%
supposed angels,
approach Abraham

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:10%
and warn him that Sodom
and Gomorrah are going

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:10%
to be plagued by disaster.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:10%
Abraham asks these beings,
who came from heaven, how

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:10%
it is possible that
they leave Sodom

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:10%
and Gomorrah to their fate.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Despite the mistakes of the
people who live in those cities

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.710 align:middle line:90%
that they had to avoid it.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.460 align:middle line:84%
That it was unthinkable to
allow something to happen that

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
would devastate them.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Then Abraham proposes
to these beings

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
from heaven, whoever
they were, that if there

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:84%
were righteous people
in Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:90%
would they stop it?

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Would they help these people
so that these towns and cities

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:90%
would not be destroyed?

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And these angels said, yes.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:84%
If they were just people,
truly just, they would stop it.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
If I were to find 50 just
people, only 50 just people,

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:90%
would you stop it?

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
But Abraham began to
reduce the number.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:84%
If there were 10 just people
and if there were fewer.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And he realized
that there were not

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
enough good people to
justify the intervention

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:90%
of these beings in our timeline.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they did not
avoid Sodom and Gomorrah

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
being destroyed by that
phenomenon that happened.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Some talk about the
impact of meteor showers,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that these beings,
possibly extraterrestrials,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
knew about and could only warn
Abraham's family so that they

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:90%
could flee from this situation.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
This is very interesting to
me, because it reminds me

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:84%
of the current, very strict
protocols of extraterrestrials.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
They say that if a
percentage of humanity,

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
a type of critical mass,
begins to live in consciousness

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:84%
with greater balance,
it could justify

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
the actions of the other
civilizations that observe us.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It could even enable entities,
maybe not extraterrestrials,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
but those who are aware of
other planes and realities,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.470 align:middle line:84%
to make some modification
in the events

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:84%
in order to give us more
time if we deserve it.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't
achieve that, if we

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
don't generate
that critical mass,

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
there will be no Sodom
and Gomorrah protocol,

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and no one will come to help us.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Because the message is simple.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The human species
has to help itself.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It has to acquire consciousness
and a peaceful behavior, love

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:84%
for this planet and
for their peers.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And only when they
start to sow and to reap

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
is when all the help
of the universe and all

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.970 align:middle line:84%
the evolved creatures
that live in it

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:90%
could then lend us a hand.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
It's what Benjamin Solari
Parravicini, the way I see it,

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:84%
called the appearance
of "the grey men,"

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:90%
who isn't a particular person.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Many have interpreted it
religiously or politically,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
in Argentina, by studying
his psychographics.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
The Grey Man, the Grey
Mass, the Grey Flower,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.635 align:middle line:84%
as seen in his prophetic
drawings, talks about balance.

00:23:30.635 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Talks about the center.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Talks about human beings finding
that equilibrium in the middle,

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.020 align:middle line:84%
not the fallacy of
the false dilemma

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
black or everything

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is white, but of the
balance in the center

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
of the critical mass that will
finally emerge on this planet

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
as Parravicini believed
and will end up

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.190 align:middle line:90%
giving us a great opportunity.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
alleged extraterrestrials

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
from the planet Venus, we
would have to analyze it

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.140 align:middle line:90%
in greater detail.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
case of George Adamski,

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
it was an interpretation that
these beings came from Venus

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
through some
drawings that he was

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
able to use to illustrate
his experience with Orthon

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:90%
in the desert of California.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Also, the footprints
that were left

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.690 align:middle line:84%
by the boots of this alleged
extraterrestrial and that

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
were in some way
preserved by George Hunt

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Williamson and the witnesses who
were with Adamski at the time,

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:84%
these footprints contain
symbols and messages

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
that were also interpreted as
part of the information that

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:90%
was delivered by Orthon.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:84%
With signs and
gestures, he explained

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
to Adamski, or at least, that
was how Adamski interpreted it,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:90%
that he came from Venus.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
In Parravicini's
case, it was different

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
because there are messages
from these beings, where

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:84%
they directly
introduced themselves

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:90%
as beings from Venus.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
I could talk about other
very famous contact cases,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.970 align:middle line:84%
like Howard Mengers, here
in the United States,

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.640 align:middle line:84%
who also spoke of
extraterrestrial entities

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:90%
from Venus.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It is very difficult to talk
about extraterrestrial entities

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:84%
on a planet so close
to Earth that could

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:90%
have been mapped by satellite.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And there is not any
evidence that a civilization

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
exists in the way that we
would expect in that world.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
However, according to messages
we have received in contact

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:84%
experiences, it is affirmed
that beings from distant stars,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking in this case of
the constellation of Taurus,

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the Pleiades stars,
have established

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
different colonies in our
solar system, on Earth and also

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:90%
on Venus.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But according to what
these messages say,

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
they are interdimensional
colonies.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
They are not physical
colonies able to be

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
detected by our primitive,
antiquated space technology.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And the description that
Benjamin Solari Parravicini

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
made, from his
alleged experience

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:84%
inside the unidentified
flying object,

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
is very similar
to the description

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
made by Adamski of
Orthon, very human

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
looking beings with long,
blond hair, even on men,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and dressed in the typical
bodysuit or jumpsuit,

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:90%
in some cases.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
That is, clothes a little
looser but still one-piece

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
clothing with boots and only
the hands and face uncovered.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Benjamin Solari
Parravicini did not

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.680 align:middle line:84%
have access to ufology
information from the United

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.045 align:middle line:90%
States back then.

00:26:43.045 --> 00:26:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about his
contract, which was in 1961.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
At that time, these experiences
were not widely reported,

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:90%
let alone in Argentina.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
His circle was far from
ufology, since Benjamin Solari

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Parravicini was a
renowned visual artist,

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
a renowned painter,
who did not mix

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
in these settings of
ufology and esotericism.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:16.155 align:middle line:84%
He was simply a channel, a
contact witness, maybe a seer,

00:27:16.155 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
a guy with paranormal gifts,
who had these experiences.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, when he made
them known in the 1960s,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:90%
he was ridiculed.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Only after several
events have happened

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that appear in
his psychographics

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
is he now considered one of the
most important modern prophets

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:90%
maybe in history.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Beyond Nostradamus
and Parravicini,

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
there are many other
cases of mediums

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:90%
able to connect with the future.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I recall the
readings of Edgar Cayce, known

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
as the sleeping
prophet, for example.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.150 align:middle line:90%
How did they all do it?

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Some, perhaps,
because they possessed

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.990 align:middle line:90%
privileged information.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Others, for their
ability to connect

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
to what has been called the
magnetic or spiritual records

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, a kind of
temporary cosmic library,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
reminiscent of the
Eastern concept

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
of Akasha, which I
have already mentioned.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.940 align:middle line:84%
More than a few, who
received their revelations

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
from extrahuman sources, be they
spiritual or extraterrestrial.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Analyzing these
experiences in perspective,

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:84%
we could conclude
that there is not

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of difference between
an extraterrestrial contact

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:84%
witness, a medium,
and a native shaman.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:84%
They all have
something in common,

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary
states of consciousness

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and the connection with
those other realities.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Is it that there are preparation
protocols for that contact

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
with those other dimensions,
with those other realities?

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:90%
We'll see in our next episode.
