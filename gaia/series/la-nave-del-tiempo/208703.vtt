descend from star gods,

do the genetics of these

what does he have

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I have left one of the most
important controversial topics

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
for the end of this series but
also one of the most profound,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
if not disturbing
ones, the battle

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.910 align:middle line:90%
of forces in the universe.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Numerous legends and
myths of the ancient world

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%
speak of a war of the gods.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it just a symbolic
story that has

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
been repeated throughout
time, or could it

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
have been a confrontation
between real extraterrestrial

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, beings that
could have been interpreted

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:90%
as gods or angels?

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what was the
cause of this battle,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
and what consequences could
it have brought for humanity?

Join me.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with you
another impossible story.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Like we discussed in the
episode on "The Cosmic Plan,"

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:84%
life on Earth could
have been sown

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
by extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But according to
the message that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
has been received in
different contact groups,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
that seed was brought from
Orion, a seed containing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
information from
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.175 align:middle line:84%
who had preceded the current
populations of this galaxy.

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:84%
What motivated
these civilizations

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:90%
to use a seed from Orion?

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.540 align:middle line:84%
According to these messages
from extraterrestrial sources,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations
have developed

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
in this material universe
filled with worlds and stars,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and some civilizations
who reached

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
a technological level
and great wisdom

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
were left practically
stagnant in their progress

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
due to their disconnection
with their emotions,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
their interconnection
with themselves

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
because they became very
technological and even

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:90%
militaristic.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
These accounts of
the extraterrestrials

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
say that a gene was
discovered in the genetics

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of these advanced
cultures, a gene that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
pushed them and
motivated them, which

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
was developed to make them
colonizers and extremely

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:90%
technological.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult to understand
how this gene was developed

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:84%
or this biological
characteristic, so to speak.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So part of the plan was to
sow a seed, a mixed seed,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
a compound seed on our planet
so that the legacy of Orion

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
would be contained within it
so that the gene could generate

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
that same influence on the
planet in the populations that

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:90%
were going to develop.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
That is that a mixed seed
that was sown on the planet

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
contained a legacy of those
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, the
aforementioned colonization

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
gene, the gene of
technology, the gene that

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
could make us be
hostile, disorderly,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:84%
with an impulse that could lead
us to take over everything.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
If human beings who were
developing on this planet

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:84%
reached a spiritual path
of balance and equilibrium

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
despite the influence of
what we could call genetics,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
it would generate
great redemption,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
a great transformation
that would not only

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
affect the human
species but it would

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.450 align:middle line:84%
affect the parent
creators themselves,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't just mean those
who were involved in the star

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:90%
sector that we call Orion.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
As a part of this
complex plan, they

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
monitored all the
processes of the Earth

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:84%
until something
unexpected happened,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:90%
the appearance of dinosaurs.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
According to the messages
from the extraterrestrials,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian species that
developed on our planet

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.500 align:middle line:90%
originally came from Orion.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
That is, in some of the
worlds of that constellation,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.570 align:middle line:84%
reptiles had developed,
and over time, became

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
intelligent creatures
upright on their spines.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Bipedal beings that
developed technology.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But their remote ancestors,
their primitive species,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
was being developed on
Earth due to the Orion gene

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:84%
due to the seed that had
been sown on planet Earth.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.580 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
dinosaurs emerged.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
A species that was not
originally from our world,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:90%
according to these messages.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, their
development put

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
into question the future
appearance of human beings

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
since theirs was a
dominant species.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, a number of
paleontologists and scientists

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
consider that if dinosaurs
had not become extinct,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
there's a good chance we
humans would not be here now.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Continuing this account
from the extraterrestrials,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
a decision had to be made so
that the project on planet

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Earth would not fail,
and they decided

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to intervene on the
planet with the extinction

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:90%
of the dinosaurs.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
This was camouflaged as the
impact of an asteroid that

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
would have had impact on the
northern Yucatan Peninsula,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:90%
eliminating 65% of lifeforms.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Today it is known through
scientific studies

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that the angle of the
object that crashed

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
was perfect in order
to cause the greatest

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
damage possible in addition
to the nuclear winter that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
occurred afterwards due
to the impact, which

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
put an end to the
majority of giant reptiles

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:90%
that dominated the Earth.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
This attack or a camouflaged
extraterrestrial military

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
operation was done in such a
way that other civilizations who

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
also observed the
Earth would not

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:90%
become aware of this operation.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happened, the dinosaurs
are no longer among us.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.470 align:middle line:84%
They became extinct
65 million years ago,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and later human
beings would appear.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
We are not reptiles like the
ancient species from Orion

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
that disappeared on
Earth, the dinosaurs.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
However, within our
genetics is the Orion gene,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
the gene that, as I
say, could propel us

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
towards warlike behavior,
colonizing behavior

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and could disconnect
us from our real path

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
unless we find the balance
point that transforms

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
us that overcomes that
genetic inheritance

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
as well as delivers a message
to the parent creators

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:84%
themselves, the
extraterrestrial mentors.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:84%
According to these
messages, part

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
of the history of Orion
with the key points that

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
imply coming from
extraterrestrials

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and their connection
to human life

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is hidden in Egypt in an actual
time portal, in a time ship.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to
the Great Pyramid.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Before diving into the mysteries
of Egyptian civilization,

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
we assumed that this had its
beginnings in the year 3100

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
BC when upper and
lower Egypt were united

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
by an individual
called Menes, also

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
known as the Scorpion
King, the first monarch

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:90%
of this lavish civilization.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Without dispute, Menes is, for
historians, the starting point.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
The fact that Egyptologists
have this information

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:84%
is thanks to a list
of kings that is

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:90%
seen on the Temple of Abydos.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:10%
It starts, as I said,
with Menes and ends

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:10%
with Seti around
the year 1,300 BC,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:10%
encompassing a period
of 1,700 years.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But today, we know that this
information is incomplete.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
found the chronology

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.400 align:middle line:84%
of Manetho, a name
which curiously

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:90%
means the truth of everything.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a list of impossible kings
in pre-dynastic times compiled

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:84%
by this Egyptian man
native of Samannud.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Manetho is supposed to have been
the high priest of the sun god

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Ra in legendary Heliopolis
back in the third century BC,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and this wise man had
collected ancient information

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
about the origins of
Egypt that give goosebumps

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:90%
to most Orthodox archeologists.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:84%
We do not have
Manetho's complete text,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
but at least we have important
fragments of his work

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.310 align:middle line:84%
in the writings of the Jewish
chronicler Flavius Josephus

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
or of Christian chroniclers
like Eusebius of Africa.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely puzzling
that Egyptologists

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
use the work of Manetho only to
refer to the historical period

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:84%
and not to the pre-history that
the Egyptian priests quoted

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:84%
not only as legends or
mythology but as real facts that

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:84%
happened in the country of the
Nile thousands of years ago.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:10%
For example, and
getting to the point,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Eusebius quotes Manetho's
work mentioning a list

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:10%
of nine gods who ruled Egypt.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.420 align:middle line:10%
Those beings are
essentially the pantheon

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:10%
of deities of Heliopolis:
Ra, Osiris, Set, Isis,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.410 align:middle line:10%
Horus, among others.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The text reads these were
the first to rule Egypt.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
From there, the scepter
of power passed from one

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:84%
to another in uninterrupted
succession over 13,900 years.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:84%
After the gods, the demigods
reigned for 1,255 years.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, another
lineage of kings

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:84%
was established who
ruled for over 1,790

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
years, and another 10 kings
who ruled for 350 years.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Next, the spirits of the
dead, reigned for 5,813 years.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:10%
All this would have happened
before the aforementioned Menes

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:10%
united the two lands of Egypt.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:10%
What are we to think if
Manetho is telling the truth?

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
How are we to
interpret the reign

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, of demigod
kings, and finally,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:84%
the reign of the
spirits of the dead?

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
unknown beings

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
ruling Egypt for tens
of thousands of years

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
prior to the emergence
of the first dynasty.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
That mysterious
time became known

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:84%
as Zep Tepi, the first time
when some beings from heaven,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:90%
the Neteru, lived on Earth.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:84%
It should be noted that
for most Egyptologists,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:84%
those Neteru are not
considered specific entities

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
but cosmic powers or forces
that the Greeks would later

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.830 align:middle line:90%
personify.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
However, the ancient Egyptian
stories hint otherwise.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the "Palermo
Stone" and the "Turin Papyrus"

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
call into question the official
story of the kings of Egypt.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Were the extraterrestrial beings
linked to the stars of Orion

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.250 align:middle line:90%
in Giza thousands of years ago?

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:10%
In 1994, I read the research
of Robert Bauval and Adrian

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:10%
Gilbert called "The
Mystery of Orion,"

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.520 align:middle line:10%
a very interesting
text that calls

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:10%
into doubt the official
versions of the construction

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids of Giza.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:10%
According to the
research, they would

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.980 align:middle line:10%
have found a curious
correlation between the three

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:10%
pyramids of the Giza Plateau and
the belt of the constellation

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:10%
Orion, proving through
software that precise alignment

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:10%
of the so-called three sisters
and the three pyramids of Egypt

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:37.920 align:middle line:10%
would have occurred on March
21st in the year 10,500 BC.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
That pre-dates the original
dating of the pyramids.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
We're talking around
the year 2500 BC.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this does not
mean that the pyramids

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
would have been built 10,000
years ago or 12,000 years ago.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But if the pyramids
of Giza are truly

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
representing Orion's Belt
since such an ancient date,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
are they marking
something in particular?

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the date of the last
great planetary change

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:90%
of that last destruction.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And why do they point to
Orion to the constellation

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Hunter, where we find the
Duat, the star realm of the god

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Osiris?

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Is it that the ancient Egyptians
knew that life on Earth

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:90%
came from Orion?

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
A significant detail is
that scientific research

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
has revealed that in the great
Orion Nebula, more than 1,600

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
light-years distance,
the so-called M42 has

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
organic molecules very similar
to those that most likely gave

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:90%
life to Earth.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:10%
The well-known panspermia theory
of life, celestial bodies,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:10%
as if they were cosmic sperm,
impact worlds with life.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
There has been much
speculation whether this really

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
happened to our planet, and
perhaps these celestial bodies

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
were extraterrestrial
missions purposely

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:90%
conducted to sow life on Earth.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And we should ask ourselves
if these seeds from Orion

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
came by chance to
our world or if they

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
would have been brought
through this advanced plan

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
However, today I know
that the pyramids of Giza

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:84%
conceal a hidden purpose
that few archeologists dare

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to recognize.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is intriguing that
no human remains have ever

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
been found in the sarcophagi
of these pyramids.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:10%
With this, archeologists
launch the argument

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:10%
that the bodies were
stolen by treasure

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:10%
hunters, an absurd presumption.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Back in the ninth century BC by
the time Caliph al-Ma'mun made

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the tunnel which serves today
as an entrance for tourists

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.170 align:middle line:84%
to visit the Great Pyramid,
he discovered, frustratingly,

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
that nothing was to be found
in either the sarcophagi

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.790 align:middle line:90%
or in the galleries.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Al-Ma'mun, another detail
to take into account,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.780 align:middle line:84%
was the son of the
legendary Harun al-Rashid,

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the poet who inspired the famous
work "One Thousand and One

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Nights," and he believed
that the legendary chamber

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:84%
of secrets of the Great Pyramid
was real and that in it were

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:90%
hidden maps of heaven and Earth.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Al-Ma'mun, from what I
was able to find out,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
belonged to a
school of mysteries.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I don't mean
to the House of Wisdom

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that was established
in Baghdad, where

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
all the volumes of scientific
and philosophical texts

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
of the time were translated.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The caliph was part of
a group of initiates

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
who knew that the secrets
of the Great Pyramid

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.430 align:middle line:84%
were possibly
associated with Orion.

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I recall the case
of the US psychic Edgar Cayce,

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
for many, one of the
greatest mediums of all time.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
He predicted before his death
that a hidden chamber known

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:84%
as the Hall of Records
would be open to humanity

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and that it would
demonstrate to the world

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic past of the
country of the Nile.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.840 align:middle line:10%
I've visited Egypt on
several different occasions,

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:10%
the pyramids, and of course,
inside the Great Pyramid,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:10%
and I have reflected
alone inside it.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Setting aside the power of
suggestion and dazed feeling

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that its fame or
extraordinary architecture

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:84%
impose on visitors or
the impression left

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
by the upward climb that is
not meant for people who suffer

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:84%
from claustrophobia,
there is no doubt

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that there is an energy that
permeates the place, which

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:90%
can be felt inside it.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Although this feeling cannot
be outwardly demonstrated

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and falls on the slippery
slope of perception,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
from the empirical side,
I have been able to trace

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary energy generated
by that incredible monument.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
According to the messages
of extraterrestrial origin,

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid sits on
invisible master lines,

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.210 align:middle line:84%
which it incorporates thanks
to its perfect geometry, which

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
organizes the unknown
currents of energy

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
with a specific
purpose to amplify.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
That is the Great Pyramid
is an architectural wonder,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:90%
a time ship.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, the
place where it was built

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:90%
is a node of energy.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
The so-called king of the Great
Pyramid seems to have the key.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.800 align:middle line:84%
For example,
according to the work

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:84%
of British aerospace
engineer Christopher Dunn,

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the King's
Chamber is not an accident.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Formed by granite made up of
55% silicon and crystal quartz,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
this chamber could have been
designed for the granite

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.210 align:middle line:90%
to vibrate in sync with sound.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Maybe rituals with mantras?

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
The music itself emitted
by the Earth's pulse?

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Thus quartz becomes saturated,
generating a flow of electrons

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.810 align:middle line:84%
through a phenomenon known
as a piezoelectric effect.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
According to Dunn, this energy
filled the King's Chamber,

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and the sarcophagus
found there, producing

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:84%
a combination of acoustic energy
and electromagnetic energy.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
All this would make
it possible to create

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
a sort of light
conduit or waveguide

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that traveled from the Great
Pyramid to somewhere else.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Was that the secret
objective of the pyramids?

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:90%
A star cannon?

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
An invisible time
ship towards Orion?

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
A kind of vehicle for whomever
dared to lay in the sarcophagus

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.660 align:middle line:84%
during a particular
ritual on a specific date

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
or with coordinates
to be launched

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
in a non-ordinary state of
consciousness towards Orion?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Does this have anything to
do with the date March 21st,

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.950 align:middle line:84%
allegedly marked by the
pyramids and their alignment

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:84%
with Orion, which coincides
with the vernal equinox

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
in that latitude of the world?

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
There are several cases
of historical figures

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
who were attracted by the
power of the Great Pyramid.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Among them, I could mention
the fabulous episode

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of Napoleon, who is said
to have spent a night

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:90%
inside the Great Pyramid.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:90%
It was 1799.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
For many, Bonaparte tried
to imitate the experience

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
of Alexander the Great
and Julius Caesar,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
who supposedly also had their
initiation inside the pyramid.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:84%
For Napoleon, it was
a preliminary step

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
for a political
conquest of Paris.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The curious matter is that
when his men asked him

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
about his night alone
inside of the Great Pyramid,

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the French military leader
and Freemason responded,

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:84%
if I told you, you
wouldn't believe me.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Another great figure who visited
the Great Pyramid, of course,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.435 align:middle line:90%
was Jesus of Nazareth.

00:19:47.435 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I must say that I had an
extraordinary experience

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:90%
It was 2003 on March 21st.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
With my team, we
achieved a private moment

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
within the King's
Chamber, and I laid down

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:84%
inside it following
the indications

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials, their
messages, instructions,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:90%
and our own research.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
We employed the use
of mantras of sounds

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize our
work at that time.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that something
extraordinary happened to me

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:84%
because I started losing
awareness of my physical body.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I felt like something
was happening there

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
in the King's Chamber, as
if everything were mutating.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
My companions affirmed to
have seen my body trembling,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and some even say that they
saw a kind of white spot

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that would swell out of
my chest and leave me.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
In the end, I lost all
consciousness of this process.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I only remember entering
into a tunnel of light

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
as if I had died, similar
to the images described

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
by those people who have had
life-after-death experiences.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I was crossing through
different landscapes that looked

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:90%
cosmic or spatial in nature.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
I distinguished
what I believe were

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
worlds, planets
until a voice told me

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that I had been projected
from the Great Pyramid

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to the stars of Orion
to the worlds of Orion.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:84%
This experience was not
occurring physically.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It was as if something
had projected

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:90%
my being or my consciousness.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to explain
it, towards that place.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
information that I'm

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
sharing in this episode and also
throughout "The Arc of Time"

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:84%
comes from everything
that was left

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
with me after this
stellar journey

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to that place the
Egyptians called

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
the Duat, the celestial
home of Osiris.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It was explained to
me what had occurred

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:84%
with reptile species on
Earth, the disappearance

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:84%
of the dinosaurs, the gene
that was to have brought

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
into our world as part
of a genetic mission

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and experimentation
for human beings

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to rise up above all as
a civilization of peace.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But I was also told that
there were great human beings

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And despite our warlike
and colonizing tendencies,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:84%
they had arisen as true
ambassadors of peace, beings

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
who had moved the
consciousnesses

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
civilizations who

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:90%
were watching us.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And then they spoke to me
about the figure, Jesus,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
beyond what religions
have made of his personage

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:84%
and the intellectual
arguments regarding

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
his historical or
non-historical reality.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt that he
existed, that he exists,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and that there is a great
hierarchy of human origin

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that connected with the divine,
unlike other great masters

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
who walked our planet,
opened the way for us

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.775 align:middle line:90%
to change things.

00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why I left for
the end of this episode

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:84%
a reflection about
the life of Jesus.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and his connection
to this mission

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
related to the legacy of Orion.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I know there are
some versions that

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
claim that Jesus was an
extraterrestrial who may have

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:90%
come from Orion or Pleiades.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Others mention Sirius.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I respect all
the information and messages

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that some channels and
contact witnesses maintain.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But in my personal opinion,
as my friend Jose Luis

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Perez-Albela in Peru
would say, Jesus

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
wasn't an extraterrestrial but
an exceptional terrestrial.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
A human being with
extraordinary capabilities

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
who was born of a woman
from the Earth, Mary,

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
a birth that was announced by
a non-human entity, an entity

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of light named Gabriel, who told
her you will have a child whom

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
you will call Jesus the Savior,
a human being who was born

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
in a very different
situation 2,000 years ago

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.060 align:middle line:84%
who was persecuted,
whose birth was also

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.190 align:middle line:84%
blessed by a light
that guided three

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
figures that tradition calls
Magi, the so-called Bethlehem

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%
UFO.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said it well.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Not the star of
Bethlehem because stars

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
do not stop and then
continue leading

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
the expedition of these wise
men over a period of months.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It was an unidentified
flying object.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:84%
These wise men also did
not approach the place

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus was born to present
gifts and offerings of incense.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But like when you seek
out the Dalai Lama,

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.600 align:middle line:84%
they would have
shown him belongings

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.840 align:middle line:84%
from Jesus' previous
life also on Earth so

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that upon recognizing
them, the wise men could

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
certify that the envoy
had arrived on Earth.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' entire life was
replete with the appearance

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of angels and chariots of
fire of supernatural beings

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and of miracles as if a greater
plan were guiding his life.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Just as what happened with
Moses as also happened

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.440 align:middle line:84%
with Abraham and with
other biblical figures,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, throughout
his mission, tried

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to teach humans that we
needed to stop fighting,

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that this influence that
could lead us to be violent

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.170 align:middle line:84%
had to be transformed into a
message of love and service.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:84%
If someone slaps your cheek,
you need to turn the other one.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And if old human laws
made you violent,

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
you had to find the
common sense to reflect

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
in your consciousness like
that case of a woman who

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
had committed adultery
and was to be stoned,

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, the
people came, the crowd

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and said to Jesus who was
sitting drawing in the sand

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%
according to ancient
law since this woman is

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.720 align:middle line:84%
an adulteress we have to
stone her what should we do?

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus answered
whomever is free of blame

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:90%
should cast the first stone.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they had
to put down the stones.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' entire message
was based on this:

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
stop fighting, find a
balance, seek that equilibrium

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
because he knew that only
through love, through service,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness would we be
able to change our humanity.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Jesus believed in it
so much that he decided

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to die as a human on the cross.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
His pain was so human
that at one time,

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.990 align:middle line:84%
he asked the universe
or God, however we

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
want to interpret it, to
take away his suffering,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that the chalice of suffering
and pain be removed from him

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:84%
but let the will of the cosmos
be done and not his own.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Such was the emotional
impact that Jesus felt

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.510 align:middle line:90%
that he even sweated blood.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:90%
However, he kept going.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And if Jesus had apprehension
about his own mission, what can

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:90%
we expect from ourselves?

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:90%
He continued on.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:90%
He died on Golgotha.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the third day,
he was resurrected

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:90%
in his own physical body.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:84%
He spent 40 days
with his disciples.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
He taught them great
things, and then he

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:84%
left, according
to the scriptures,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:84%
in body and soul
somewhere in the universe,

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
promising to return, which is
another topic of discussion.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Who is coming back, Jesus?

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Will the spirit of the
cosmic Christ return?

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a symbolic
message as the skeptics

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
say that Jesus did not
exist, that it is all just

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.890 align:middle line:90%
an allegorical message?

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:90%
I've already said it.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Jesus existed.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
He exists.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
he will return.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a wonderful experience
with which I would

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:90%
like to conclude this program.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:84%
It happened to me on
Mount Horeb in Sinai.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.565 align:middle line:84%
It was a dream, simply
a powerful dream.

00:27:59.565 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:84%
In this dream, I saw
the figure of Jesus

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhat different from
how he is represented

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:84%
in Christian
iconography, specifically

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
with beautiful light brown eyes
that could look deep inside

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and long, shiny brown
hair and asked me

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
why is there so much
conflict over me?

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Why are they divided into
beliefs and religions

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:90%
when I was always with you?

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I was the first human
being on the planet,

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.740 align:middle line:90%
and I will also be the last.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:90%
I have lived in different ages.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why I've
introduced myself

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.580 align:middle line:84%
as the alpha and the omega,
the first and the last.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I had the feeling
that Jesus had been Krishna.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.420 align:middle line:84%
That Jesus had been Buddha,
among other great figures who

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.280 align:middle line:90%
are spiritual icons of humanity.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow, if this
is so, we have been arguing

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.380 align:middle line:84%
over different images of
the reality of the universe

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.780 align:middle line:84%
and of Earth's own
messengers, and we

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.420 align:middle line:84%
are in the presence
of the same spirit who

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
has been living as a human
throughout the history

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:90%
of mankind.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:84%
With that, the message that John
saw on Patmos the apocalypse.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.460 align:middle line:84%
If all this is true,
there is a promise

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:84%
for change, a
promise of a return.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether
we have a gene

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:84%
from extraterrestrial
civilizations who have preceded

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:84%
us who have even made
mistakes the myth of fallen

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
angels, which is a very
complex story, perhaps

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.980 align:middle line:84%
we humans are here to
understand that history

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and follow the path of
the great masters who

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:90%
walked to this planet.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:84%
A path that says we must
stop fighting and seek more

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:52.360 align:middle line:90%
to be a warrior of light.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We are now in
times where we need

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:90%
to be ambassadors of peace.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.630 align:middle line:84%
At least, that is
what Jesus taught.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Putting aside
religious topics, I

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.050 align:middle line:84%
must say in this last broadcast
without any apprehension

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus is my boss.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I know he exists, and we
serve a higher purpose.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Without a doubt, we could
dedicate a lot of time

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to each of these subjects.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle line:10%
We could discuss
whether we are facing

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.430 align:middle line:10%
real events of cosmic origin
that human beings have ignored

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.950 align:middle line:10%
or if they're merely
symbolic stories that

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:10%
hide an even more profound
truth, as renowned mythologist

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:10%
Joseph Campbell would say.

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.030 align:middle line:10%
In any event, there
is a powerful message,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.250 align:middle line:10%
and we have to trace
it in order to know

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:45.720 align:middle line:10%
who we really are and the
mission that we should fulfill.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, I quote the great
master, Jesus of Nazareth, "Ask,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:90%
and it will be given unto you.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Search, and you will find it.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Knock on the door, and it
will be opened for you.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Whoever has ears to
understand will understand."

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being part of
the crew of "The Arc of Time."
