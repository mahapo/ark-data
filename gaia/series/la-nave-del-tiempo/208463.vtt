00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the theories that
seeks to explain the origin

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.710 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs points to the
underground world.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Did those ships and
their occupants not

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.090 align:middle line:84%
come then from outer space
but from the hollow Earth?

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:10%
Other claims hold
that those who are

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:10%
in that mysterious
underground realm

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:10%
are not extraterrestrials
but survivors

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:10%
of disappeared civilizations,
like Plato's mythical Atlantis.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:10%
What's behind all this?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez Corpancho.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.895 align:middle line:10%

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
When we enter the universe
of contact witnesses,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
we assume that these experiences
are developed exclusively

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:90%
with entities of cosmic origin.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But the matter is
much more complex.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the UFO phenomenon
and the extraterrestrial

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
hypothesis, there
are other mysteries,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
secrets that do not necessarily
lead us to other worlds

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but to the confines
of our planet.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.640 align:middle line:10%
Let me tell you about
the legend of Shambhala

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:10%
and the interterrestrial enigma.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:84%
According to the
message of these beings,

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.830 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago, a
group of entities

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
origin arrived on Earth.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:10%
These entities formed part of
the aforementioned alliance,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:10%
a kind of Confederation
of advanced civilizations

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:10%
that tries to introduce
messages, information,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:10%
and stimuli to worlds that
are going through the learning

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:10%
process.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:84%
These beings would have
arrived thousands of years

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
ago, after the last destruction
that our planet suffered.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean a big disaster
with global impact

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that we remember as the fall
of Atlantis or the Great Flood.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:84%
This incident apparently
happened about 12,000 years

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:84%
After that event and the
recovery of the planet

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and the emergence
of new civilizations

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
based on survivors is how
these entities from the cosmos

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.210 align:middle line:84%
arrived in our world to generate
a kind of library of the Earth.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:10%
According to the narration
of extraterrestrials,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:10%
this happened someplace
in the Gobi Desert

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:10%
in present day Mongolia.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.740 align:middle line:10%
There, they founded a sanctuary
of peace, a place of balance

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:10%
that could contain the
information of what

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:10%
human beings have learned so
that it does not disappear

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:10%
through the cyclical
destructions

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:10%
that planet Earth has faced.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.930 align:middle line:84%
It was called
Shambhala, the place

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
of peace, the place
of tranquility,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
according to one of its
translations from Sanskrit.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this is the
extraterrestrial version.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
There are other
legends that we'll

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
hear about today
in northern India

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and in other Asian countries
that mention Shambhala

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
as more of a realm of immortals,
of highly evolved men who

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
confined themselves
to unknown places

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth, such as the
mythical Himalayas or the Gobi

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Desert, as I mentioned, in order
to protect their information

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and only share it
with great initiates.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But what interests us
here is the version

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrials'
messages,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:84%
a version in which many
points seem to coincide with

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:90%
legends from the Orient.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:10%
This message says that
beings who came to Earth to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:10%
found Shambhala did
not arrive alone

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:10%
but they brought a large
crystal, a stone of power

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:10%
which current legends
call Chintamani,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:10%
the jewel of thought, the
Orion Crystal, as it is also

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:10%
known in the world of the
occult, a crystal that

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:10%
originally was bright
green and which

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:10%
was placed in the Great
Stupa or the Shambhala tower

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:10%
in the Gobi Desert.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It is difficult to understand
this process mixing legends

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
and the message of
extraterrestrials,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
but apparently that
crystal did exist,

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
a crystal that would have the
ability to absorb information,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
since we were talking about
this library of Shambhala that

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
would have generated
these hierarchies that

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
came from the stars, a crystal
capable of absorbing everything

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
experienced by human
beings, in fact,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials say.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:10%
And this seems to be
associated to the Asian legend

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:10%
that when the crystal
arrived in our world,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:10%
it was divided into
three fragments

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:10%
so that these
little pieces could

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:10%
travel all over the
planet intermixed

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:10%
with humans and
their experiences

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:10%
and then go back to
the mother crystal.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Even if this may sound fantastic
and like a contradiction,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
one of these crystals may have
been the Holy Grail itself

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus Christ had.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:10%
Then, when these
crystals returned

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:10%
to the mother
stone, when they do,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:10%
which still has not happened,
according to our information,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:10%
the great crystal will return
to its place of origin.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the prophecy
of the Chintamani,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
the prophecy of the
return to Orion,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
the prophecy of Shambhala, a
prophecy in which, by the way,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich and some great
mystics of the 19th century

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:90%
accepted and believed.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
There is a painting by
Nicholas Roerich which

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
represents the white horse that
came from the stars, perhaps

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
from Orion, called
Nukta, and about his loin

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
is the agni, the
fire, which we assume

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
is the representation
of the Chintamani.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
There is also another
painting by Nicholas Roerich

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:84%
which shows a group of
masters coming out of a cave.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:90%
One of them has a chest.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Found inside that chest is one
of the fragments of Chintamani.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
These masters of the
White Brotherhood

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
are supported by the
stars of night sky.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And, as you can
see in the image,

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the stars depicted are
Orion, Orion's belt.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Was, in fact, the main
mission of Shambhala

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
associated with different
civilizations connected

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:90%
to the intricacies of Orion?

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:10%
I should mention that
Nicholas Roerich,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:10%
a great Russian
humanist, painter,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:10%
creator of the Banner of
Peace, which, in fact, he

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:10%
created based on the esoteric
symbolism of Chintamani,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.870 align:middle line:10%
had a UFO encounter in
the decades of the 1920s,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:10%
precisely when he
was investigating

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:10%
the legend of Shambhala.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Roerich described that UFO
encounter in his travel book.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It was August 5, 1926.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
His expedition was stunned
with what they had witnessed.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.405 align:middle line:84%
I quote Roerich's
writing verbatim.

00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
"We looked at each
other in amazement

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
because we all simultaneously
smelled a strong perfume.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought of the best
incense from India.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Where was it coming
from, surrounded

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:90%
as we are by sheer cliffs.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:84%
The lamas in his
company whispered,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
don't you smell the
fragrance of Shambhala?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
A cloudless sun-filled
morning, the blue sky shining,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
above our camp flies a huge
black vulture, our Mongolians,

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:90%
and we ourselves observe it.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, one of the Buryat
lamas points to the blue sky.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:90%
A balloon?

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:90%
An airplane?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
We notice something
very bright that

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
was flying high from the
Northwest to the South.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
From the tent, we retrieved
three powerful field glasses

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and we made our way towards the
gigantic shining sphere which

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
stood out against
the sun, clearly

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:84%
visible against the blue
sky and which moves swiftly.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
We see right away that
it changes direction,

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Southwest,
to the Southwest

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
and disappears behind
the snowcapped peaks

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Humboldt Range.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
All the campers saw
the unusual appearance,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and the lamas whispered,
the sign of Shambhala."

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
What was it that Nicholas
Roerich and the lamas that

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
accompanied him really
saw, so that it would be

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
said that that UFO sighting
in the decades of the 1920s,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
long before the famous Kenneth
Arnold sighting in 1947,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
represented a sign of Shambhala,
guardians of Shambhala.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Is this mystery of Shambhala
and the underground world

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:84%
associated with UFOs
and their occupants?

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle line:84%
Not to be overlooked is that
Nicholas Roerich describes

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
an aroma like incense, like
a very pleasant perfume,

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
something that has happened in
some extraterrestrial contact

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
experiences, very friendly
and wonderful in nature,

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
where contact witnesses prior to
the encounter with these beings

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:84%
with human features had
perceived a very pleasant smell

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
that permeated the atmosphere,
almost like the seers

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:90%
with the apparitions of Mary.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Do their aromas reveal
the high frequency

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of the beings who are
about to reveal themselves,

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.250 align:middle line:84%
unlike another context
of unpleasant odors

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that ancient religions
associated with presences

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
that are not positive?

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it's
to the contrary,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:84%
a sense of peace, a
very pleasant scent,

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
like the best
incense from India.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the sighting of the
Golden UFO and the marvelous

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
phrase of the lamas,
the sign of Shambhala.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Almost immediately,
some detractors

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
wanted to minimize
this experience,

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:84%
arguing that Roerich's
expedition had

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.030 align:middle line:90%
observed a weather balloon.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Ridiculous.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The object was moving
fast, changing course,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and the people who were
there had time enough

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
to study the sighting
with their binoculars.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the camp located
in the District of Kuknoor,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
near the Humboldt
Mountain Range,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
there were very well trained
guides and climbers who

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.770 align:middle line:90%
attested to the observation.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, few know
that the Soviet police

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.390 align:middle line:84%
had proposed to the recognized
Dr. Konstantin Ryabinin--

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
forgive my Russian-- to
join this expedition,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and he also observed the strange
flying apparatus in 1926.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
I reiterate, a sign of
Shambhala, just as the lamas

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
told Roerich during this
wonderful apparition.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The history of this
Chintamani crystal

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
deserves an entire
episode of its own.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll look into
that in the future.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:10%
But now I can say that according
to the messages that we have

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:10%
received in our
contact experiences,

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:10%
that crystal was brought by
these beings who established

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:10%
their base in the Gobi Desert
of Mongolia thousands of years

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
This crystal emerged
as an anomaly

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
in the region of the
Great Orion Nebula.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:84%
According to what has
been explained to us,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
it is as if from higher
plains a nonphysical energy

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
crystallized, condensing
into a large crystal,

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and was discovered by advanced
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
of the star sector
that we call Orion.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And this crystal has
extraordinary faculties,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
even for extraterrestrial
technology itself.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And the discovery
of this crystal

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:84%
was very important for the
Orion sector's distinct

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
and numerous civilizations.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It is impossible to
specify the worlds,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
nor the precise stellar
sector that became fascinated

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.920 align:middle line:84%
by this crystal, since,
according to our information,

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:84%
this transcended Orion and
was transformed into a mother

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
crystal almost to the point
of being a revered crystal,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
since this crystal
was transformed

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
into a very precious
element, not

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
just for the different and
numerous civilizations of Orion

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
but elsewhere in the
material universe.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.000 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
If this story is authentic,
if this narration

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrials
is genuine,

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
that this crystal can be found
in some secret place on planet

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Earth, obviously in
the underground world.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Chintamani, the crystal of the
cosmos, the maximum crystal

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
of Shambhala,
obviously over time

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
has unleashed new
interpretations,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.330 align:middle line:84%
both philosophical
and spiritual.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Eastern
texts, Chintamani

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
is associated with a kind
of jewel of discernment

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
some mystics also

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:84%
associate with the mysteries
of the pineal gland.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:10%
That is, the inner
Chintamani would

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:10%
be our tool of consciousness.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
However, it is a rock, a
stone, a physical element

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
that arrived from the universe,
and its three fragments

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:90%
traveled to the Earth.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Beyond its mythical or symbolic
meaning, its name says it all.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Chinta, deep thought, mani,
meaning precious jewel.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the jewel of thought,
the jewel of discernment,

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
the stone of co-creation,
able to manifest realities

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
through thought.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this crystal that
originated in the cosmos

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the Great Orion
Nebula, the so-called M42,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:84%
according to the story
of the extraterrestrials,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
comes not from a physical
universe but a mental one,

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
from another reality that
crossed its strength,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:90%
its radiation--

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what terms to
use-- into our physical reality,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and it became that
co-creation crystal,

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
in that crystal of
the cosmic mind.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
According to our
contact experience,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:84%
an underground
society exists which

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:84%
was founded by survivors of the
last catastrophe, the remnant

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of great forgotten civilizations
who, over thousands of years,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
have remained silent and just
training followers, initiates,

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
so that through
them their message

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:90%
might reach the outside world.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Esoteric groups call these
beings the White Brotherhood

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:90%
or the White Lodge.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the teachings of
Theosophy in the 19th century,

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.960 align:middle line:84%
these elusive masters
became very popular

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:90%
among esoteric students.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:10%
But beyond these
versions, it seems

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:10%
that extraterrestrial
contact has

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:10%
some commonalities with
this White Brotherhood

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:10%
and the Legend of Shambhala,
since the origin was

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:10%
cosmic and the teachings
migrated from civilization

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:10%
to civilization to come
to reside currently

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:10%
with these great initiates
who protect this knowledge.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:10%
Chintamani and Roerich's
Banner of Peace

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:10%
is part of the mission
of this mysterious White

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:10%
Brotherhood associated with
the legend of Shambhala.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Roerich, according
to my research,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:84%
would have had direct
contact with these emissaries

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of the underground
societies, particularly

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:84%
those who were hidden in the
Altai mountains of Mongolia.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
They told him that
he should form

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
a movement in all of
the places of peace

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.670 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, places that
had information, culture,

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
everything that has been
developed by human genius,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
so as to not be destroyed
in times of peace

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:90%
or even in times of war.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
He was tasked with
the Chintamani mission

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
so that he could convince the
great authorities of the world

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that it is so, that there
is a pact for the protection

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:84%
of these special places of the
Earth, both natural and those

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:90%
that involved the human genius.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And so it was that
Nicholas Roerich, who

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.680 align:middle line:10%
managed to persuade US
President Franklin Delano

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:10%
Roosevelt himself in 1935,
here in the United States,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:10%
to sign the Roerich
Pact, the Pact of Peace.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:10%
And the emblem of that pact
was the [NON-ENGLISH],, no less,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.165 align:middle line:10%
the banner of Shambhala,
the Chintamani stone.

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.320 align:middle line:84%
This symbol, which
is sometimes used

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
by UNESCO and by the United
Nations organization itself,

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:84%
it is a cosmic
symbol, a symbol that

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:84%
is embodied on Earth
when these beings arrive

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:90%
from other worlds.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:10%
When you visit
somewhere on our planet

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:10%
that you find
wonderful, cultural,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:10%
or some natural sanctuary and
there is a little sign that

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:10%
says, Cultural Heritage
of Humanity by UNESCO,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:10%
UNESCO is based on the
Roerich Pact, that is,

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:10%
the mission is being fulfilled.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The message of Shambhala
and the message

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
of these emissaries
to Nicholas Roerich

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:90%
is more alive than ever.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
But when we talk of
the underground world,

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to make a clarification,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:84%
since there is
usually some confusion

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
between the large
underground galleries,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.980 align:middle line:84%
where survivors
of other cultures

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
can find themselves, to the
mystery of the hollow Earth.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.610 align:middle line:84%
According to our messages
and the investigations

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
we have done, obviously
the Earth is not hollow.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:10%
It has a molten center formed
perhaps by nickel, by iron,

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:10%
with temperatures exceeding
5,000 degrees Celsius.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Part of the formation of
the Earth's magnetic field,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.700 align:middle line:84%
as we have explained on other
occasions, that is released

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.040 align:middle line:84%
through the poles, generating
a large toroidal force field,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
but it is in the crust where
the large galleries are found,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
where many civilizations from
other worlds may have settled,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
like the remnants
of already mentioned

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
lost cultures, such as Atlantis
or the Kásskara of the Hopi

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Indians in the Pacific Ocean.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But there is no such
thing as a hollow Earth,

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.030 align:middle line:84%
at least in the literal sense
that has been given to it.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:10%
When I'm asked about the
expedition of United States

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:10%
admiral and aviator Richard
Evelyn Byrd and his expeditions

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:10%
both to the North and South
Pole and that he encountered

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.015 align:middle line:10%
unidentified flying saucers that
came out of the hollow Earth,

00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:10%
Byrd never said that.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It is an apocryphal diary
circulating on the internet.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:90%
The information is not real.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
In these expeditions,
like the one of the 1940s,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
in 1948, Highjump,
discovered something.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:10%
It isn't related to a hollow
Earth but to lands without ice

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:10%
or some military
bases that are located

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:10%
in some enclaves of
Antarctica, for example--

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:10%
and this is unrelated
to the subject at hand--

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:10%
but there is no such
thing as a hollow Earth,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.600 align:middle line:10%
but a world with great
underground galleries

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:10%
where the survivors of the last
great destruction of the Earth

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:10%
would be guarding the
true history of humanity.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us head on
to the Legend of the White

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Brotherhood.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
The subject of the White
Brotherhood is very broad.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It includes information
from contact experiences

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
from ufology, from esoterism
shrouded in mystery.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
ways to interpret it.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, there's
the concept transmitted

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
in extraterrestrial
contact, our own experience,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:84%
the aforementioned
survivors of lost cultures

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and their remnants, protecting
the annals of culture

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
in the underground world
so that at some moment

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
the true story of humanity
can emerge and be revealed.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
The concept of the
White Brotherhood

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:90%
refers to the underground world.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Then, there is
another associated

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:84%
with human teachers in
very private, impermeable,

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
esoteric schools
who have contacted

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:84%
some initiates in human
society so that they

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:90%
may make their messages known.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that was the case
with said Madame Blavatsky

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and the Theosophical Society.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Later, there is an
interpretation which is also

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
mystical, more new age, that
some of these teachers, humans

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.250 align:middle line:84%
with much knowledge
and information,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
upon losing their
physical body, upon going

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
through their transition,
and others who did

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:84%
not even die but
they ascended, have

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.830 align:middle line:84%
been transformed into spiritual
teachers, ascended teachers,

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
which is not exactly
the subject at hand.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:84%
However, all these kinds of
manifestations of teachers,

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
of survivors, of
information librarians,

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
of great minds who guide
humans on the surface,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
are included under the
concept of the great agreement

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.350 align:middle line:84%
of light, or the Great White
Lodge, or the Great White

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Brotherhood.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Their purpose, whoever they
are, is to silently inspire

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.860 align:middle line:84%
men and women of the
Earth on a spiritual path

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and through them, the sacred
doctrine, the great message,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
the great work, reach our
entire species, especially

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.435 align:middle line:84%
in times of great
tribulation and great change.

00:21:26.435 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is very important to add
that Nicholas Roerich received

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
one of three fragments
of the Chintamani stone.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:10%
According to people who met him,
and I spoke with some of them,

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:10%
in his day in Mongolia,
and also in Russia,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:10%
that experience of
temporarily possessing

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:10%
one of those fragments
of Chintamani, which

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:10%
allowed him to convince
important politicians,

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:10%
such as President
Roosevelt himself,

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:10%
to carry out the Roerich Pact.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.380 align:middle line:84%
He would have brought the
fragment to the United States

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
for them to see supernatural
proof of his contact

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
with the mahatmas of Altai,
with the masters of the East.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.168 align:middle line:10%
After completing his
mission, that fragment

00:22:18.168 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:10%
would have been
returned to Mongolia.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich returned the
stone to the underground world

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:84%
because they are the guardians
of the underground world who

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
protect the fragments, the
interterrestrial guardians.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
According to this
information, these fragments

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
are then released
by them in a way

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that they filter
into our society

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and are the magical
objects that have been

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:90%
known throughout our history.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
One of them, the mythical
Holy Grail of Jesus

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
according to this
information, we should not

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:84%
forget that medieval tradition
mentions that the Holy

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Grail was a green stone,
like the Chintamani,

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that fell from heaven after
a battle of the angels.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Or the [NON-ENGLISH],, itself,
the Holy Grail of the Incas,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
which was also another
green stone that was placed

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:84%
in the custody of the guardians
of the lagoon of Llanganati

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in Ecuador, that is,
mythological beings,

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:84%
or intraterrestrial guardians
in this area of the rainforests

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:90%
of Ecuador.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Different stories to
describe the same phenomenon.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
If those underground refuges
exist, where is the evidence?

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:84%
There are certainly
secret places located

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.810 align:middle line:90%
in unknown areas of the planet.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I have been able to
visit many of them

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and I have had truly
incredible experiences.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:90%
The first occasion was in 1996.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:10%
I was a 22-year-old
young man and was

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.390 align:middle line:10%
exploring the legend of Paititi,
the lost city of the Incas.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:10%
It is said that in
the 16th century, when

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:10%
the Spanish conquest
arrived in Peru,

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:10%
a group of masters of the
former Empire of the Sun

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:10%
fled to the jungle to build a
twin city to Cusco, Paikikin

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:10%
Cusco, the city
similar to Cusco,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:10%
which means the
navel of the world.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
However, Andean masters
say that the city already

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
existed and was in a
secret place in the jungle.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:90%
And I went to investigate.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It was September 5th
of that year, 1996,

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
when I had a close
encounter, and not

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
necessarily an experience
that we could categorize

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:90%
as extraterrestrials.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:90%
It was something else entirely.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.920 align:middle line:84%
I heard a noise
behind me while I

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
was examining the
petroglyphs of Pusharo,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
a rock 98 feet long
and of similar height

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.100 align:middle line:84%
containing various symbols,
which for the locals,

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Machiguengas, correspond to a
sacred language that allows you

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
to connect to other realities.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I was studying them.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It was daytime, if I
remember correctly,

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
around 5:00 in the afternoon,
when the foliage behind me

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:90%
began to move.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I heard it clearly
and I turned around

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
to defend myself from
what I thought was

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:90%
an animal coming to attack me.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
We were in the Madre de Díos
area of the Amazon jungle,

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:90%
in the Manú National Park.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.370 align:middle line:10%
But when I turned around,
wielding a long stick

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:10%
to defend myself from what
I assumed was a wild animal,

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:10%
I was facing a man with
prominent Asian features

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:10%
with a long, thin beard.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:10%
He was dressed in what I
believe was a kind of tunic

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:10%
with a golden metallic
color and, on his head,

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.790 align:middle line:10%
an elongated helmet,
which reminded me

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:10%
of those helmets or crowns
used by the pharaohs

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:10%
in ancient Egypt.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
That is, the
appearance of this man

00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:84%
was exotic to suddenly find in
the Amazon rainforest of Peru.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
He raised his hand in
the form of a greeting

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and I felt calm,
because at that moment

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I was frozen, petrified
with this presence that

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:90%
had emerged here in the jungle.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:84%
He told me in perfect Spanish,
without moving his lips,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that I should be calm,
that I stay quiet, that he

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:90%
had something to share with me.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
He approached and
through images,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
through some kind of
very immersive film

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.960 align:middle line:84%
that he was
projecting in my mind,

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I believe he made me
understand that this supposed

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
lost city was nothing more
than an underground refuge,

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
an intraterrestrial society to
which this man, who identified

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:47.930 align:middle line:84%
himself by the name
of Alcir, belonged.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:52.220 align:middle line:10%
He even told me that a powerful
tool, well known to the Incas,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:10%
named a solar
disk, that was once

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:10%
in the Temple of Coricancha,
was in their custody.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:10%


00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:10%
We will explore this
information in greater detail

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:10%
in an upcoming episode
of "The Arc of Time."

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:84%
This being, Alcir, left
a deep impression on me

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and a series of data, which I
don't know how he introduced

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
into my conscience, that
made up the starting point

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
of my first book, "The
Masters of Paititi,"

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
which I wrote when I
was only 22 years old.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.730 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't all.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Later in 2002, I
participated in an expedition

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
to the Cave of the
Tayos in Ecuador,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
a place that was found by
the Ecuadorian military

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
but that only rose to fame
in the decades of the 1960s,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
due to an explorer of
Hungarian origin naturalized

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:90%
in Argentina, Juan Moricz.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
He affirmed to have
found large galleries

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle of
Coangos in Ecuador

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and a metallic library of
an extinct civilization.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:84%
According to the
testimony of Juan Moricz,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
the Taltos lived there, quite
tall beings in white tunics,

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.610 align:middle line:84%
who protected a records
room with this information

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Earth times
from ignored civilisations.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It reminded me greatly of
the legend of Shambhala

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and I participated in an
international expedition.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:10%
We stayed inside these caves
for three days, which apparently

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.190 align:middle line:10%
go on for miles,
not only in Ecuador,

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.620 align:middle line:10%
but they go deep into
Peruvian territory.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:10%
Important to note is that
American astronaut Neil

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:10%
Armstrong was there in
1976 on an expedition

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:10%
with British specialists.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And when he came out
of the Cave of Tayos,

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.390 align:middle line:84%
he told the
Ecuadorian press, what

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I have experienced
within these caves

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:84%
has surpassed my
experience on the moon.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:58.720 align:middle line:84%
But what was it that Dr.
Armstrong experienced?

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, there in the Cave of
Tayos in 2002, the impossible

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:90%
happened to me.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:84%
The natives of the
area, the Shuar,

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:84%
had told us that there are
some very small creatures that

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
moved around in the caves and
in the grottoes, which they

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.640 align:middle line:84%
respected and did not
want them to be disturbed,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.940 align:middle line:84%
but they only show themselves
when one has been in the area

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:84%
for three days, for
these creatures, which

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I will call Sunkies, or Nunkuis,
based on the local legend,

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:84%
because they are very
sensitive, these creatures

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
need time to evaluate the
stranger, the visitor.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And so it was that after
staying for a while

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
inside these
underground galleries,

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
these beings appeared
before our eyes.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:90%
They are nyctalopes.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:90%
They move in the dark.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:84%
That is, they're not
accustomed to light.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I shined my flashlight on
them to see them better

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and they covered their big
eyes with their small arms

00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
to protect themselves from
the light from my flashlight.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So I had to aim the flashlight
not directly at them

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
but to illuminate
them peripherally

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.280 align:middle line:90%
so as to not hurt their eyes.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:84%
They were small creatures,
3 to 3 and 1/2 feet tall,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
with small hands
which appeared to be

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.290 align:middle line:84%
a terracotta gray color,
large, dark eyes that

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
seemed to have no eyelids.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
They had no nose,
just two nostrils.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:84%
They had no mouth,
just an opening.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell that they
had a slightly bulging belly

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and a navel.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:90%
They are born that way.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:90%
It was a tremendous shock.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Because here we are no longer
talking about descendants,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.220 align:middle line:84%
survivors of lost
cultures who took refuge

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.140 align:middle line:90%
in the subterranean world.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We are not even talking
about extraterrestrials.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Shuar tradition,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.450 align:middle line:84%
they are creatures
as ancient as humans,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
only that while we
grow up on the surface,

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
these creatures grow up
in the underground world.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time when these
beings, the so-called Sunkies,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.335 align:middle line:84%
had friendly communication
with humans from the surface.

00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.660 align:middle line:84%
They provided human beings on
the surface with precious gems

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and some secrets of
the underground world.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:84%
But, as sometimes
happens, humans

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
change and tried to
exploit these creatures.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Then they began to
take refuge in deeper

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:84%
underground
galleries, where it is

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.400 align:middle line:84%
more difficult for human
beings to reach them.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.890 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the most
incredible experiences that

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:84%
has happened to me in my life,
which isn't related to others

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that I have already told about
the extraterrestrial contact.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Because one of these
creatures came up

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to me and with his
fingers, he touched my arm.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Their communication is tactile.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:90%
They don't talk.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And when they touch you, it's as
if part of their consciousness

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
migrates to you.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I felt their pain, their
sadness for the pollution

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that humans had
generated in the jungle

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.210 align:middle line:90%
with petroleum, with mining.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for me to
convey all this and, above all,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:84%
prove it, because
these experiences

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:90%
have that characteristic.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:84%
They're only real for those of
us who have experienced them.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.020 align:middle line:90%
But I'm telling the truth.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And our expedition had this
extraordinary encounter

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
with beings that
also are from Earth

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.980 align:middle line:84%
but who grew up in
an underground world.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:84%
All of this enigma points
to the legend of Shambhala.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.230 align:middle line:84%
We are not alone
in the universe,

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.950 align:middle line:84%
but we are not alone
on the Earth either.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.430 align:middle line:90%
There are creatures like us.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.880 align:middle line:84%
There are creatures different
from us and other enigmas who

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.725 align:middle line:90%
live in silence under our feet.

00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:52.320 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And this man, about 65 years
old in appearance with Oriental

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:84%
features, who emerged in
the middle of the jungle

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and who we have seen on
other expeditions accompanied

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.380 align:middle line:84%
by other witnesses, he is
obviously not an entity

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.780 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But he is part of an
underground society

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:84%
which is located there in the
jungles of Manú National Park.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.930 align:middle line:84%
According to what
he transmitted,

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
he has managed to
delay his aging.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:84%
He said that he was
born in the year 1146.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So for more than
eight centuries,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
he has been living
in the jungles,

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.070 align:middle line:84%
although he appears to
be a 60-year-old man.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And his mother is human.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:84%
He's a native, or was a native,
from the Machiguenga culture,

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
who, curiously, also have
those Asian features, maybe

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because their ancestors came
from Asia over the Bering

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Strait to populate the Americas.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating
story about the origin

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of this being who
calls himself Alcir,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and who has contacted
other witnesses in addition

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:90%
to my own case.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I will say that these
experiences and information

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
are transformative as
well as extraordinary.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:11.820 align:middle line:84%
They tear our intellect to
pieces, breaking paradigms.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
disturbing, becoming aware

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:17.290 align:middle line:84%
that there is intelligent
life in the universe.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.940 align:middle line:10%
It is already wonderful,
but also becoming aware

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.050 align:middle line:10%
that we are not alone on Earth,
that we live with other beings,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:10%
is an incredible revelation.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I think the message
of Shambhala means

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:84%
living in peaceful
consciousness,

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.059 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness of
an intelligent planet.

00:34:36.059 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:84%
As my ancestors in Peru
say, with Mother Earth,

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
with Pachamama, in
consciousness with the creatures

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, not
only the ones we know,

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:84%
animal and plant species, but
also with others that we do not

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.500 align:middle line:84%
know, like the enigmatic
case of the Sunkies,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and living in consciousness
with our actions,

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
just as Nicolas Roerich
proclaimed when he had contact

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
with those elusive
masters of Altai,

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:84%
those masters who apparently
have inspired esoteric schools,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
spiritual groups,
contact groups,

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:84%
so that their
information does not get

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:19.990 align:middle line:84%
lost and stimulates a great
change in our society.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.530 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.350 align:middle line:10%
We are not alone
in the universe,

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:10%
but we are not alone
on Earth either.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.490 align:middle line:84%
As the French poet Paul Éluard
wrote, "there are other worlds,

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:90%
but they are within this one."

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And on the next
journey, we will explore

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.220 align:middle line:90%
one of them, Mount Shasta.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez
Corpancho and we

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
are aboard "The Arc of Time."
