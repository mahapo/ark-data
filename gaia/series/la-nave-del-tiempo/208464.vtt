Mt.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, located in
northern California,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
is one of the biggest
and most impressive

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.980 align:middle line:90%
strata volcanoes in the world.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:10%
At 14,179 feet high,
its gigantic figure

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:10%
is the source of numerous
legends, UFO reports, and even

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.640 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial
close encounters.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:90%
But let's start with the name.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:90%
What does "Shasta" mean?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Historians assume that it's
an old, indigenous word that

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:90%
means "white mountain."

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.750 align:middle line:84%
In addition, "Shasta"
has been reported

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
to be the name of an Indian
tribe that in 1840 lived

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:90%
in the vicinity of the volcano.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Most likely, the Indians
have been so named

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:90%
in honor of the mountain.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Regarding its discovery,
we know that, in 1817,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:84%
a Spanish explorer,
friar Narciso Duran,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.830 align:middle line:84%
was the first to
cite the mountain he

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:90%
called "Jesus Maria."

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But several years later,
precisely in 1841,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
the Wilkes Expedition then
renamed it "Shasty Peak,"

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
publishing the first
known illustration of Mt.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Today, everyone just
calls it "Shasta,"

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
the name displayed on the
maps of the United States

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
since 1850.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the first esoteric
writings about Mt.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Shasta dates back
to the year 1886.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It was written by
Frederick Spencer Oliver.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:84%
"Inhabitant of Two
Planets" was his work,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's about a pipeline that
already mentions an alleged

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
inner temple with Mt.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Shasta and survivors of
Lemuria and Atlantis--

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
information which would
later be replicated

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
in Rosicrucian and
Theosophist writings,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:90%
feeding this idea even further--

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.690 align:middle line:84%
an idea that seems to
be backed by testimony

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
of several visitors
to the mountain who

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
affirm to have seen
tall human figures

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
dressed in white
tunics wandering

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
forest, and suddenly they

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
would disappear unexpectedly
without a trace.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Digging a little deeper
into this information,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I found the story of a strange
discovery occurring in 1904.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The protagonist was geologist J.
C. Brown from the Lord Cowdray

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Mining Company of London.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Brown claimed to have
found a tunnel that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
went into the hollows of Mt.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued, not thinking much
about it, he went inside.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
When he had gone in, according
to his testimony, over 3 miles,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
he found traces of
copper and gold mining.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And this which, according
to the geologist,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
had nothing to do with
recent mining activity.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything seemed
very old to him.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
He looked around the
area and then continued

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
through the tunnel,
which soon led him

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to a very large gallery
full of metallic objects.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
There, Brown observed statues
of gold and a shiny disk

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:90%
golden in color.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:10%
Immediately afterwards,
he found some plates

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:10%
that also appeared to be made
of gold, which contains symbols

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:10%
similar to Egyptian writing.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:90%
But that was not all.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.047 align:middle line:84%
Brown also claimed to
have found 27 skeletons.

00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
The extraordinary thing
is that some of them

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.340 align:middle line:90%
measured close to 10 feet tall.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
According to Brown,
two of those giants

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
seem to be mummified
years later.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.190 align:middle line:10%
Precisely in 1931, US
esoteric M. Doreal,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:10%
author of the famous
channeling called

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:10%
"The Emerald Tablets of
Thoth the Atlantean,"

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:10%
declared to have found
those secret corridors that,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:10%
according to him,
appeared to be Mayan.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, even
though Brown's studies

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:10%
stretched for more
than 30 years,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:10%
specialists questioned
his discovery.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And the fault lies with Brown
himself because he did not

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:10%
want to guide a scientific
expedition into Shasta's depths

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:10%
to show his supposed
gallery of records.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:10%
You will recall, when we
talked about the Cave of Tayos,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:10%
it is a very similar site--

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:10%
underground world,
secret galleries,

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:10%
metallic plates with symbols,
like the ones allegedly

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:10%
found by Moricz in Ecuador, for
a time held by Salesian Father

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:10%
Carlo Crespi.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And apparently, the same
situation is found at Mt.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Shasta-- a difficult
situation to verify

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
since Brown's testimony
could never be confirmed.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:10%
Nonetheless, Shasta also
holds other similarities

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:10%
to the Cave of the Tayos,
since there in its forests

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:10%
the presence of small creatures
has been reported, very similar

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:10%
to the so-called Sunkies.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous witnesses
was physicist Miriam Sharpe

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:90%
from the city of Costa Mesa.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, if all this
were true, who is

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:84%
behind those underground
galleries in Mt.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Shasta?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
We've talked before of
the underground world,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of the possibility of
beings from other worlds

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
having chosen the depths
of mountains, volcanoes,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
underground galleries
below great deserts

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:90%
to establish their bases.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about survivors
of vanished cultures

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
or even about unknown
creatures such as

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.395 align:middle line:90%
the aforementioned Sunkies.

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Does all this exist
on the white mountain

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:90%
in northern California?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:90%
There is an extraordinary story.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.680 align:middle line:84%
It really fascinated me when
I read it for the first time.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Josef Blumrich, a NASA
aerospace engineer,

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
had an interview with Hopi
leader White Bear back in 1970.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And White Bear, the Hopi leader,
told a fantastic, extraordinary

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.220 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
According to the native
leader, thousands of years

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
ago, there existed a great
civilization in the Pacific

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Ocean called Kasskara.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The civilization was
forced to flee their lands

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
due to a volcanic
eruption-- actually,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
the chain eruption
of many volcanoes

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.355 align:middle line:84%
that ended up plunging this
culture into the Pacific Ocean.

00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Those who managed
to survive did so,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
thanks to some gods of
the stars called Kachinas.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Ancient, wise, and
venerable, according

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
to what was described
by White Bear,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.790 align:middle line:84%
these Kachinas came on
some flying shields,

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and they came from Pleiades--
from the Pleiades stars.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
On these flying
saucers, the Kachinas

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
rescued some of the
inhabitants of Kasskara

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:90%
to take them to America.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Blumrich was stunned
and held a skeptical position

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
for a time since he believed
that these accounts had

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:90%
little validity.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:10%
But we all remember that
Blumrich himself did a study

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:10%
on the appearance
of the glory of god

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:10%
before the biblical
prophet Ezekiel.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:10%
And he ended up
convincing himself

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:10%
that what was seen
by the prophet

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:10%
was actually an
object that appeared

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:10%
to be a vertical
take-off command module,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:10%
like those used by NASA,
and that those wheels

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:10%
and those beings similar to men,
who appear in his description,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:10%
corresponded to
something concrete

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.300 align:middle line:10%
that Ezekiel, on the
shores of the Chebar River,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:10%
had seen a UFO, an unidentified
physical object, outright.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.955 align:middle line:84%
And this led to Joseph Blumrich,
despite his credentials

00:08:19.955 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
as a NASA scientist, to
investigate other stories.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
the Hopi story comes

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in-- a Hopi story connected
to Shasta and other stories.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Kasskara existed,
according to tradition,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:90%
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It is also known in
the esoteric world

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
as Mu, which gets
confused with Lemuria,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian ocean in the
southeastern part of Africa.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
White Bear revealed to
the American scientist

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
that the masters of Pleiades,
the mysterious Kachinas,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
led survivors to three specific
places in America, those

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that they managed to
save from Kasskara--

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:90%
one of them to Mt.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Shasta in California, another
to the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and another exactly
to Lake Titicaca--

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:84%
three places that White
Bear was able to identify

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
through photographs
of these sites.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But now we are
concerned with Mt.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Who are those who live
inside the mountain

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and do not show
themselves openly?

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Are they, by chance,
descendants of Kasskara,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
as we have talked
about in other stories

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
of the extraterrestrial enigma?

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Have survivors of Kasskara
and their descendants

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:84%
inside the northern
volcano of California

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
protected the legacy
of their culture?

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Would this explain
the appearance

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of tall beings
dressed exotically,

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.390 align:middle line:84%
walking in the middle of the
forest, and then disappearing?

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Are they physically
there, or is it

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
a holographic memory of a story
lost thousands of years ago?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics might say it's
just a Hopi story, a myth,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
a story that we are
associating with the isolated

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
report of several people
who, with a thirst

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
for extraordinary
experiences, visit Mt.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Make no mistake.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We would just be scratching
the surface of the mystery.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:90%
Mt.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Shasta has provided
unequivocal proof

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that it is an authentic
place of contact

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and that a secret
lies in its bowels.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Personally, although
I have not seen

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.640 align:middle line:84%
those so-called
inhabitants from inside Mt.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Shasta in the middle
of the forest,

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I have indeed been
able to witness the UFO

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%
activity in that place--

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
quite remarkable, very
important activity,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
which is even associated with
our own contact experiences.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
As I have said on
other occasions,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Shasta has been
the main location

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
for our scheduled
encounters with sightings,

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
with objects, in the presence
of journalists, investigators,

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:84%
specialists of the
UFO phenomenon.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps the most
important case is

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:10%
that of Paola Harris,
when, in the year 2014,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:10%
she accompanied us
to an area of Mt.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Shasta called Sand Flat--

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
a large clearing on a plateau in
the middle of the forest, where

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Antarel, an entity of
extraterrestrial origin

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and Nordic in appearance,
whom I have described

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:84%
in other interviews
and TV appearances,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
emerged there before a
large group of witnesses.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Paola Harris was completely
stunned, impressed

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:84%
when, within the energy that
had manifested in the Shasta

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.500 align:middle line:84%
forest, a bright
white energy that

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
was coming from the ground, this
tall being arose, practically

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:84%
floating weightless,
before the witnesses

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and who spoke perfect English--

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:84%
in the case of Paola Harris's
language, in English--

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and he said "thank you"--

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:90%
gracias.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:10%
Paola didn't understand why this
Nordic-looking entity wearing

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:10%
a dark suit would thank her
in her language, in English.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Then we learned incredibly
that this being Antarel, one

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrials
associated with the Alpha

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Centauri case which we
have already discussed,

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.340 align:middle line:84%
was thanking Paola Harris
for her dissemination work

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
in the future
regarding these beings.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
That is, it is as if the message
were coming from the future,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and Paola Harris was
listening to it on Mt.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Shasta in 2014.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Why Mt.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Shasta?

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
According to this entity
Antarel and other beings

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial nature
who have manifested themselves

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:90%
there, it is because Mt.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, aside from being a
great gallery of records,

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
like the Cave of
Tayos in Ecuador

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and so many other
spots in the world,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
it is also an entry and exit
vortex for these ships--

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
ships already linked to
extraterrestrial groups

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:90%
operating in our reality.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why Shasta is a special
contact place for sightings

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and allows these beings to show
themselves more openly when

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.880 align:middle line:90%
they have so arranged it.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Paola Harris has
been transformed

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
into one of the main witnesses
of a close encounter on Mt.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Her career and prestige
in the world of ufology

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:90%
has put the skeptics in check.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And on Shasta, on
different occasions,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.560 align:middle line:84%
we have been able to film
anomalous objects flying

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:90%
over the forest.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Here are some of the
images for you to see.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Some objects that were even
caught on night vision cameras

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to have physical
consistency, density,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
like one might
assume of a vehicle,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.740 align:middle line:84%
but they look like plasma moving
just above the pine trees.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
These contacts continue to occur
in the solitude of Shasta's

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
forests and in similar
places across the world.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:10%
We call them neutral zones--

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.320 align:middle line:10%
places of contact
that have been marked

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.420 align:middle line:10%
by the extraterrestrials.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:10%
What makes them special?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Their telluric energy
because Shasta is a volcano?

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:84%
The existence of these
extraterrestrial bases?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Vortices or anomalies
that allow connection

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.050 align:middle line:90%
with those other realities?

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Or the simple fact of
being away from big cities

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is also a strategic requirement?

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it may be, it is clear
that these contact places are

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.050 align:middle line:90%
just a reflection of ourselves.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Nicholas Roerich
called them "Jalniks"--

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
places of compassion,
sites of miracles.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:90%
But on Mt.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, not only have we had
sightings of these objects

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
or the physical
presence of beings

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen as a
group with other witnesses.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I know this is going to
sound difficult to accept,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
but on Shasta was the
last occasion when

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I was able to, at
least in my perception,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.485 align:middle line:84%
physically go inside
these beings' ships.

00:14:53.485 --> 00:14:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It happened on the
26th of August of 2012.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I'd been invited to--

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
through communications, the
echographs that I mentioned--

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
to meet face to
face with Antarel.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
The contact was scheduled at
night on the Sand Flat plateau

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
there on Mt.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
I remember we were
at the viewpoint

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.900 align:middle line:90%
on top of the mountain.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:84%
This was during the
day with a large group

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
of people who had participated
in one of my expeditions on Mt.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And a metallic object appeared
that could be seen perfectly

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.390 align:middle line:90%
in contrast with the blue sky.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:90%
We took out our cameras.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to film
and photograph it.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
And although we all saw the
object through the cameras,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.820 align:middle line:84%
it did not appear in the
viewfinder of the cameras.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:90%
This happened in three cases.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We were unable to record video
on three different cameras.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The sky appeared clear without
any kind of anomalous object,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and yet we saw the disk.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I felt that, with this
sighting in the middle

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of the day of a greyish silver
object that looked like a disk,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
these beings were
confirming the contact

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:90%
I was going to have that night.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
When the time came
for the experience,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
we approached Sand Flat,
and there was no one there.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
We were alone--
no camp or anyone.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We started to practice
our preparation techniques

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
based on concentration,
on mediation,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to be calmer, focused.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
At the time that these beings
indicated that the contact was

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
going to happen, a
very bright object

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
appeared of stunning gold
flying above the pine trees.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
All of the people who
were there saw it.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about 12 people.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, the
extraterrestrials

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
gave me the feeling
that I needed

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to stand up from
my camping chair

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and approach a
clearing in the forest

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:84%
where they had previously,
in mental visions,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.100 align:middle line:90%
shown me where we would meet.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Although I've had
these experiences

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
on different occasions,
obviously, it's

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:90%
not easy to face.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
These contacts, although
I've seen them several times,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
I know that they come
with positive intentions

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
and that their messages
and information are

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary that
it has allowed us

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
to reach many
people in the world,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
not to convince them
of these experiences

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:84%
but to invite them
to reflect on them.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Being exposed again to a similar
situation is very complex.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I admit that when I walked
towards the clearing

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
in the forest while my
companions waited for me

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.490 align:middle line:90%
at the base, I became nervous.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The mere fact of meeting
Antarel again and possibly

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
visiting one of his ships as
they had previously indicated,

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
it was a very difficult
situation for me.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:90%
But something happened.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
When I got to the
clearing in the forest,

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:90%
I heard some children--

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
what I thought were children due
to their high-pitched voices--

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
as if at play, doing
something, moving around.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I was coming to the
indicated contact place.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.820 align:middle line:84%
There was a clearing
in the forest,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
clearly that there

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
was a tree trunk in the area, a
fallen tree, and I approached.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, there were some
children, half a dozen

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of them, very young, maybe
between 10 and 12 years old.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:90%
They were there playing.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And it caught my attention that
they were in summer clothing.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And at that time of
night, it was cold.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was August,
summer time here in the United

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
States, at night on
Shasta, in the mountains,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:84%
feels quite cold because we are
obviously at about 6,500 feet

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:90%
where the camp is.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But these children were playing
as if it were 75 or 85 degrees

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Fahrenheit.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.670 align:middle line:90%
It caught my attention.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, are they so focused
on playing that they

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
haven't realized it's cold?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this
happens with children.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
bundled up walking

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.580 align:middle line:90%
towards the anticipated contact.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I forgot
about the experience

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to come, about their
invitation, about the sighting

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of the golden object, about the
sighting during the day that we

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:90%
couldn't record on video.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I forgot.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
My nervousness went away
because I said, well,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:84%
an experience is not going
to happen here on Shasta.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.640 align:middle line:90%
No contact is going to happen.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:90%
There are some children here.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:90%
They must be lost.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to approach them to
ask, where are your parents?

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Where are they camping?

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And then something
incredible happened there.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
When I began to
approach the children,

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:90%
they came running towards me.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
They held hands and
formed a circle around me,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and they began to go around
in a circle around me.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I said,
something here is not right.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:90%
That's when a flash--

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
powerful, white,
and very bright--

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:90%
blinded me.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It made me close my eyes.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I immediately lost
contact with the ground.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I lost touch with Shasta.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see the
children anymore.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It was like being inside
a white beam of light--

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
something that had
already happened to me

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
in a similar experience in
the Peruvian desert of Chilca,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
which I shared in the past
on "Cosmic Disclosure,"

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
only now it was repeating
itself but on Mt.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly appeared
in a large circular hall,

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.710 align:middle line:84%
immaculate white, perhaps
80 feet in diameter.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is where
Antarel appeared.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:90%
I felt breathless.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember it now as if
it were happening again.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It was gripping.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't discern if
what I was going through

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
was real, if the
children were real, even

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
if my visit to Shasta was real.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going crazy.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew all this was happening,
but my concept of reality

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:90%
was distorted at that time.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything went so
fast, so sudden,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't know
what was going on.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Antarel approached me.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I've already described him
in our other interviews.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:90%
He's a rather tall man--

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:90%
over 8 feet tall approximately.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:84%
He was dressed in a
silver metallic suit.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And when he approached
me, mentally he

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:84%
told me to be calm, that
I was in the right place,

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that he had taken me
inside one of their ships.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And I, reacting in a
disrespectful way, confused,

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:90%
I asked, but is this real?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Am I here with
you inside a ship?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And what can you tell
me about the children

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:90%
who were down below?

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what happened?

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And the extraterrestrial
mentally told me,

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:90%
the children were created by us.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:90%
It was a hologram.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We did it so that you
would become calm,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
so that we could bring
you inside the ship.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And, although this
sounds silly--

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:84%
stupid on my part, and
excuse the expression--

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I said, of course.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:10%
You had to do a trick
to calm me down in order

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:10%
to once again bring me
inside one of these objects.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:10%
And how do I know that this
that I am experiencing with you

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Antarel is not another
hologram, like you

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:10%
did with the children,
who seemed so very real?

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:90%
And he walked towards me.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:90%
And I got scared.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I thought that the
extraterrestrial

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:90%
might have gotten angry.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And he brought his immense
hand closer to my chest

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.690 align:middle line:90%
and touched me.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:90%
He touched me.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And for the first and
only time, he spoke to me.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.520 align:middle line:84%
That is, he did not
connect his mind with mine,

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
but he spoke to me in a
strange neutral Spanish.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And he said, Richard--

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
my name is Ricardo, but my
family, my close friends,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:84%
call me Richard,
and curiously that

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:84%
was the name that Antarel
used to speak to me.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Richard,
we are your friends.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:10%
We are your brothers.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:10%
You are really here.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Touching my chest,
in that instant,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I knew, although I did
not want to accept it,

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:84%
that I was not in a hologram
but inside some place--

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:84%
on a ship, which was floating
over Sand Flat on Mt.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.790 align:middle line:84%
In this contact, I had a
dialogue with these beings

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:84%
to do our first research
and expeditions to Altai.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It was an area
that they indicated

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to us in Siberia, in
Russia, and also in Mongolia

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand all the
significance of the movement

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
for the consciousness
on the planet level

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and some shamanic traditions
of that area, which also have

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
a connection with old contacts
with extraterrestrials--

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
a subject that perhaps we will
address on another occasion.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
But based on this contact
in the year 2012 on Mt.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, on this wonderful
plateau where we usually

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
camp on Sand Flat,
is when I started

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:84%
researching the secrets of
Altai with greater intensity.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So Shasta is an
ideal contact place,

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
most incredible experiences

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.860 align:middle line:90%
that I have gone through there.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:10%
These beings say that contact
places are training centers.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Mt.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Shasta is the training center.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.670 align:middle line:10%
And there, people
who have decided

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:10%
to go there to accept an
invitation from these beings

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:10%
may receive information,
revelations,

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:10%
one's own experience in
itself of the contact,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:10%
to give rise to a
transformation, not

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.510 align:middle line:10%
only individual but that
generates a long-term chain

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.980 align:middle line:10%
reaction.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:90%
When one visits places like Mt.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, or the Desert
of Atacama in Chile,

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
or the Chilca Desert in Peru,
or Lake Titicaca in Bolivia,

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:90%
or Mt.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Uritorco in Argentina, or
Montserrat in Barcelona,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.150 align:middle line:84%
or Monte Perdido between
France and Spain, among so many

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
places in the world that we
have visited and investigated,

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
these no longer belong,
according to these beings,

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:90%
to planet Earth.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
They are now considered
neutral areas,

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:90%
which we mentioned before.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like when an American
is visiting India.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You enter the US
Embassy in India.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Once you go into the embassy,
you're in the United States.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, something similar happens
when these beings invite you

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:90%
to Mt.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Shasta or similar
contact places.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
When you enter them,
you are no longer on Mt.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Shasta.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.970 align:middle line:90%
You are no longer in California.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:90%
You're not in the United States.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:90%
You are not on planet earth.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.890 align:middle line:84%
In that context of invitation
and acceptance and contact,

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:90%
you are in a neutral area.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, the
extraterrestrials

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
affirm that the best
training is held there,

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:90%
that information is conveyed.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:84%
In my personal
case, I think that I

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:84%
am one of many witnesses
in the world who

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.000 align:middle line:84%
has been going through
these types of processes

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and experiences to make
known what we have received

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:90%
in those training places.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I say this with
a lot of humility.

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I think that this work
has inspired many others

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:84%
because, for decades,
we have criss-crossed

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
the world connecting places,
living experiences, receiving

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
information, and
we've made it known.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And today, others are
doing it, and it's

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
a chain that won't be
interrupted because we

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
are about a small part of
a much bigger plan that

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:90%
is moving forward.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the importance of
contact places like Mt.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Shasta-- places that are
just a reflection of us.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, obviously,
it is the purpose of the path

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:90%
that we are on.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, these
contact experiences

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:10%
do not happen every day.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's been 30 years--

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
30 years of living
experiences, of traveling

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
the world researching
this phenomenon,

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:84%
with many field visits,
many expeditions.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet, despite the
fact that three decades

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
have gone by, only on eight
occasions in 30 years--

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:84%
only on eight
occasions-- have I been

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
able to physically
see these beings.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that has been
enough to realize

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.510 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
these experiences,

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
of the reality of
these contacts,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
of their global reach.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.570 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones who decide
under what circumstances

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and which places they
may manifest themselves

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and to which witnesses.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But it always goes along
with some higher purpose.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:84%
As I've always said, I am one
of many contact witnesses.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a special
person nor am I chosen

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:84%
in our way of
understanding, but I

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
am aware that they considered
that, through my testimony,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
it could reach a
greater audience.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It is also important to
clarify that the techniques

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of the contact principles,
as we have discussed

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:84%
on other occasions, are
an attempt to communicate

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:90%
with the universe.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:84%
But to have much more direct
and intense experiences,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
it takes more than
a contact protocol.

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
It takes a mutual decision,
not only among the witnesses

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.290 align:middle line:84%
but with the beings
who facilitate

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:90%
these types of encounters.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
has happened with us

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and our research team
throughout the years.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It is my testimony.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:90%
It is my experience.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee you that it
is one of many in the world.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.570 align:middle line:90%
See you in the next episode.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:84%
On that occasion, we
will travel together

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:84%
towards the enigma of the
Maya and prophetic calendars.
