But how did it all start?

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:84%

I was just a five-year-old boy,

I saw them for the first time.

It was at El Bosque
Country Club,

which is on the outskirts
of the city of Lima,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
a place for my family to
relax on the weekends.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember that we had
stayed up very late,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and the stars were already
twinkling in the mountain sky.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
That's when I saw some lights
moving over the hills and then

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They would change speed
and direction erratically,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
as if they were playing a game.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
At such a young age, I didn't
have the slightest idea

what I had just witnessed.

experiences were accompanied

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%

Then he broke his
oath of silence

that he had made with
these humble people of Peru

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:90%
to tell his story.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.935 align:middle line:84%

and spiritual and
esoteric groups

And there he met beings with
human features, who allowed

also known as truth serum,
here in the United States.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.800 align:middle line:84%

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because groups came to Lima
linked by this information

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the techniques were
contact for meditation

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
to generate extraordinary
states of consciousness,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to seek out a message
with these beings.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And they interacted with the
first ufology research group

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
in all of the Americas.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%

Institute of Interplanetary

Relations, a very pompous
name, the IPRI, which

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
had been founded by the great
researcher Jose Carlos Paz

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Garcia Corrochano.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It was then that
this information

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
became part of this
ufology group, which

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
began to try to receive messages
or communication according

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to the protocol that Enrique
Castillo Rincón and his groups

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.105 align:middle line:84%
had followed already
in 1972 and 1973.

In a place, which today is

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
is located about 37
miles south of Lima,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Maruja Soler De Acervo, the lady
of the desert, as we call her,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:90%
was having contact experiences.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:90%
It was the decade of the 1960s.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that decade, she

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
began to receive messages
and communication

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and to have paranormal-type
unexplained experiences

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
in her home in Papa
Leon XIII in Chilca.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Her gripping experience
happened between 1970 and 1972,

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's when Maruja,
as she was known, or Maru,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
decided to ask for
help for someone

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.395 align:middle line:84%

happening to her.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%

son, Juan Acervo,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to go to the IPRI

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:84%
the Peruvian Institute of
Interplanetary Relations,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to get some type
of advice or information.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Juan Acervo approaches
Jose Carlos Paz Garcia

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and tells him, my
family is receiving

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
messages, having
sightings, experiences

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:90%
in the area of Chilca.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
This information is historical
because from the syncretism

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:90%
of experiences is born--

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
at least according
to my research--

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
what is called the Rama group,
one of the most important

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
contact movements

in the history of
Hebrew America.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It started in the summer of 1974
with brothers Carlos and Sixto

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Paz Wells, two authentic
contact witnesses who,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
as teenagers 18 or 19 years
old, received messages,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
communications like
those received earlier

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
by Maruja Soler De Acervo,
or Castillo Rincón.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And they met in Chilca, in
fact, in the summer home

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
of the same Maruja
Soler De Acervo.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And there is where the sightings
and experiences happened,

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:84%
but all this activity was
limited to the environment

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.595 align:middle line:90%

received an important message

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
from an extraterrestrial entity,
who called himself Kulba,

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:84%
an opinion like those described
in the reports from Ancash

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:90%
in the Peruvian Andes.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And this entity allowed him to
invite the Spanish journalist

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
JJ Benitez to go out into the
desert on September 7, 1974,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and verify the appearance
of these objects

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:84%
through a pre-arranged
contact appointment.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
That is, these beings
indicated on what day,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
at what time, and in
what concrete place

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
they were going to appear.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Deciding occurred.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And when JJ Benitez
returned to Spain he

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:90%
published his first book UFOs--

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:90%
an SOS to Humanity.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the first
book he wrote,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was the first
that was published.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It became a bestseller.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there began to emerge
different contact groups

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
throughout Latin America.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
This story, which may be
unknown to many, which did not

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
start in Peru, but in
different countries,

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and it has followed a common
thread, a common thread where

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
yours truly is just
one of many contact

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
witnesses of this exciting
story that continues on.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Investigating all
this, it was evident

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that I was just one
of very many witnesses

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
who had come into contact
with those beings.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was precisely
there in the Chilca desert

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
when I saw them
for the first time.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
August 30, 1997, was the first
time I saw one of these beings,

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
who we know as
Apunians, face to face.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I had been invited to
the desert of Chilca.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%

small group for these beings

communication or have

an experience with individuals,
a few people, or small groups.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
They say their proximity
can affect our psyche

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in an unpredictable
way, and they

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
don't want to destroy
our social context

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
as we face a contact,
which obviously breaks

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
through our paradigms
and the type of life

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that we usually live.

of resilience,

over our camp, zigzagging,
emitting large flashes

This being, who introduced
himself as Antarel,

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
asked me to accompany him
towards an object that

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:84%
had arisen from the
bottom of the hills,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
floating about 100
feet off the ground,

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:90%

strange, so different.

didn't dare take one more step.

Antarel, who I mentioned,

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
told me in perfect Spanish
in my mind to stay calm.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I was better prepared,
we would resume the contact

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and accompany them
inside their ships.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Then he left.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:90%
I went back to the camp.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
The ship lit up, rose
above the desert.

over, and they decided

are having these
extraordinary experiences

But on other occasions, we have
been able to observe, witness

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that his eyes were
very penetrating,

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:84%

introduce themselves,
