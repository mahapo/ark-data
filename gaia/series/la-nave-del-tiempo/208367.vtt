But how did it all start?

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.210 align:middle line:84%

I was just a five-year-old boy,

I saw them for the first time.

It was at El Bosque
Country Club,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
which is on the outskirts
of the city of Lima,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
a place for my family to
relax on the weekends.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember that we had
stayed up very late,

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and the stars were already
twinkling in the mountain sky.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
That's when I saw some lights
moving over the hills and then

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:90%
in the sky.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They would change speed
and direction erratically,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:90%
as if they were playing a game.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
At such a young age, I didn't
have the slightest idea

what I had just witnessed.

experiences were accompanied

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:84%

very lucid, very clear,

that he had made with
these humble people of Peru

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:90%
narrating from Peru--

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because groups came to Lima
linked by this information

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
the techniques were
contact for meditation

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
to generate extraordinary
states of consciousness,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to seek out a message
with these beings.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And they interacted with the
first ufology research group

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:90%
in all of the Americas.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to the Peruvian
Institute of Interplanetary

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Relations, a very pompous
name, the IPRI, which

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
had been founded by the great
researcher Jose Carlos Paz

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Garcia Corrochano.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It was then that
this information

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
became part of this
ufology group, which

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
began to try to receive messages
or communication according

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
to the protocol that Enrique
Castillo RincÃ³n and his groups

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.105 align:middle line:84%
had followed already
in 1972 and 1973.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
In a place, which today is
famous in Peru, Chilca, which

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:84%
is located about 37
miles south of Lima,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Maruja Soler De Acervo, the lady
of the desert, as we call her,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.630 align:middle line:90%
was having contact experiences.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:90%
It was the decade of the 1960s.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
that decade, she

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
began to receive messages
and communication

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and to have paranormal-type
unexplained experiences

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
in her home in Papa
Leon XIII in Chilca.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Her gripping experience
happened between 1970 and 1972,

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and that's when Maruja,
as she was known, or Maru,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
decided to ask for
help for someone

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.395 align:middle line:84%
to explain what was
happening to her.

>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And she asked her
son, Juan Acervo,

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
to go to the IPRI
that I mentioned,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:84%
the Peruvian Institute of
Interplanetary Relations,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to get some type
of advice or information.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Juan Acervo approaches
Jose Carlos Paz Garcia

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and tells him, my
family is receiving

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
messages, having
sightings, experiences

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.870 align:middle line:90%
in the area of Chilca.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
This information is historical
because from the syncretism

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:90%
of experiences is born--

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.150 align:middle line:84%
at least according
to my research--

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
what is called the Rama group,
one of the most important

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
contact movements

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
Hebrew America.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It started in the summer of 1974
with brothers Carlos and Sixto

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Paz Wells, two authentic
contact witnesses who,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
as teenagers 18 or 19 years
old, received messages,

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.900 align:middle line:84%
communications like
those received earlier

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
by Maruja Soler De Acervo,
or Castillo RincÃ³n.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And they met in Chilca, in
fact, in the summer home

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
of the same Maruja
Soler De Acervo.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And there is where the sightings
and experiences happened,

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:84%
but all this activity was
limited to the environment

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.595 align:middle line:90%
of the contact groups.

Paz Wells, Charlie,

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
as he was known back then,
received an important message

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:84%
from an extraterrestrial entity,
who called himself Kulba,

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.020 align:middle line:84%
an opinion like those described
in the reports from Ancash

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:90%
in the Peruvian Andes.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And this entity allowed him to
invite the Spanish journalist

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
JJ Benitez to go out into the
desert on September 7, 1974,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and verify the appearance
of these objects

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.920 align:middle line:84%
through a pre-arranged
contact appointment.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
That is, these beings
indicated on what day,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
at what time, and in
what concrete place

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
they were going to appear.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Deciding occurred.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And when JJ Benitez
returned to Spain he

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:90%
published his first book UFOs--

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:90%
an SOS to Humanity.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the first
book he wrote,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was the first
that was published.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It became a bestseller.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there began to emerge
different contact groups

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
throughout Latin America.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
This story, which may be
unknown to many, which did not

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.910 align:middle line:84%
start in Peru, but in
different countries,

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and it has followed a common
thread, a common thread where

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
yours truly is just
one of many contact

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
witnesses of this exciting
story that continues on.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Investigating all
this, it was evident

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that I was just one
of very many witnesses

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
who had come into contact
with those beings.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was precisely
there in the Chilca desert

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
when I saw them
for the first time.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.510 align:middle line:84%
August 30, 1997, was the first
time I saw one of these beings,

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
who we know as
Apunians, face to face.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I had been invited to
the desert of Chilca.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I went out with a very
small group for these beings

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
it is easier to initiate
communication or have

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
an experience with individuals,
a few people, or small groups.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
They say their proximity
can affect our psyche

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in an unpredictable
way, and they

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.350 align:middle line:84%
don't want to destroy
our social context

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
as we face a contact,
which obviously breaks

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:84%
through our paradigms
and the type of life

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:90%
that we usually live.

of resilience,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%

will not drastically affect

this type of close encounter

different experiences.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
over our camp, zigzagging,
emitting large flashes

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
of light, which even
lit up the ground,

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:44.120 align:middle line:84%

type of weight or density that

to the ground, and you picked
up the dirt with your fingers,

light in your hands.

these objects produced.

This being, who introduced
himself as Antarel,

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:84%
asked me to accompany him
towards an object that

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:84%
had arisen from the
bottom of the hills,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
floating about 100
feet off the ground,

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:90%

told me in perfect Spanish
in my mind to stay calm.

And when I was better prepared,
we would resume the contact

and accompany them
inside their ships.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:90%

extraordinary experiences

been able to observe, witness

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.160 align:middle line:84%

very penetrating,
