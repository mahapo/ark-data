>>RICARDO GONZALEZ
CORPANCHO: How could we

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.090 align:middle line:90%
talk with a sphere of light?

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Are they a manifestation of
beings of higher consciousness?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:90%
What is their origin?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
conventional contact

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:84%
with an extraterrestrial
entity, we

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
are facing an
interdimensional contact.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ricardo González Corpancho.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.755 align:middle line:10%
Welcome on board
"The Arc of Time."

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's time to delve into one of
the most fascinating mysteries

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
of contact cases, a close
encounter with entities

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:90%
of light, beings of pure energy.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:90%
What could we call them?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Cases of extraterrestrial
creatures

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:90%
remotely moving their image?

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
A type of holographic
projection?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Or are there
consciousnesses of energy

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that do not possess
a physical body?

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Interdimensional beings, as
we could perhaps define them.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to share a special
case with you, a very

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:90%
important experience for me.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I have great
affection for Uruguay.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I love visiting this small
and wonderful country

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:90%
of South America.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I have made a lot
of friends there.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And its geography, which
houses just over 3 and 1/2

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
million inhabitants, a highlight
are its fascinating beaches,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
vast rolling plains, which
cover much of the country.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
The Uruguayan terrain
is basically Pampa,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and precisely in one
of those regions that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
are hosts to beef
cattle production,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
it's where the incident
occurred that I will describe.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
La Aurora is the name of
one of these ranches, farms,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
huge fields, that cover
about 2,500 acres.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It is located a few yards
away from the border

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
bridge between the departments
of Salto and Paysandu.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
That bridge crosses the Daymán
river, each bank belonging

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:90%
to one of these two regions.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
On this ranch, or estancia
as it is called in Uruguay,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:84%
you get there by a
narrow dirt road which

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
branches off from Route 3.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It is a renowned enclave of
mystery, not only in Uruguay

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
but also in South America.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And not by coincidence.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of 1976, its
owner Don Ángel María Tonna,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
started to have
extraordinary UFO experiences

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
in the presence of his family
and even with his farmhands.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
All his witnesses,
one of these workers,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
already had warned
of the presence

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
of those strange lights
that moved around

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.370 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, objects
that remained immobile

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
over the ground, and then zipped
toward other strange objects,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
which they then
seem to go inside.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
During one of these episodes,
while the alleged mothership

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
was leaving, there
was a blackout

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.310 align:middle line:84%
in the city of Salto,
which is located

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:90%
just six miles from the ranch.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But the incident that
started everything

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
occurred on February 4th,
back in the year 1976.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
In the early
morning local people

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
saw an intense glow in the
sky, and the Tonna family

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.097 align:middle line:90%
heard a kind of explosion.

00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.190 align:middle line:84%
When they left the house,
they found a destroyed ombu,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:84%
a tree with a large
canopy that can

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
reach a height of
50 feet, that is

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
native to that region
of South America.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The entire top of the tree
had practically disappeared.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
This ombu was only 55 yards
away from the farmhouse

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:90%
and main buildings.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The tree was left
strangely split in half,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
producing a deep hole
down into its roots,

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:90%
about two feet in diameter.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And near it there were some dead
animals, frogs, field rabbits.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Really disturbing, because it
was as if they were frozen.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
As if all this were not
enough, the Uruguayan army

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:84%
heard about this
experience and had

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
soldiers camped on the ranch
with the Tonna's consent.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
The purpose was to privately
investigate the phenomena.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:84%
But according to Tonna
himself, the soldiers

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
became very frightened
when the lights reappeared.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So the military hurriedly
broke camp and left.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Officially, of course,
this did not happen.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And the more skeptical Uruguayan
investigators in this field

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:90%
consider it a myth.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
However, the unexplained
phenomenon in the area

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
is so plentiful that it is too
much to simply be dismissed.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
thing in the Aurora case,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is that beyond the UFO sightings
of strange lights and phenomena

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
on this Uruguayan Ranch, is that
visitors who came to this place

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:84%
with some physical
ailment or illness

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
began to recover,
specifically when they focused

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
on those areas of the field
where the lights had appeared

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:90%
and where marks had been left.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Apparently people
were healed there.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And this situation was what
made La Aurora stand out

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
as a place of contact
where people were healed.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It's fame transcended
Uruguay and became

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:90%
an international phenomenon.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued by these
miraculous healings,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Argentine esoteric,
Ángel Cristo Acoglanis,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
went out to the farm.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And later a well-known Brazilian
esoteric writer, [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:84%
did not let the opportunity
slip by to write a book

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:90%
on the Aurora phenomena.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Neither Tonna nor
his family ever

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
approved the content
of that text.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:90%
But the damage was already done.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
The ranch in Uruguay
was transformed

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
into a first-rate
place of pilgrimage

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:90%
where entire busloads arrived.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, entire busloads of
sick people as if the place

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
were a sanctuary for the
Virgin Mary, which it actually

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
became due to some people's
fanaticism, who ended up

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.915 align:middle line:84%
mixing their religious beliefs
with extraterrestrial contact.

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And those healing processes
that people experienced

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
occurred in places where the
ships, or whatever they were,

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
left marks on the ground,
which is what we're

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:90%
seeing in this photograph.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
People approached
and would lie down,

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
experience a healing, even,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%
according to Tonna, people
who had terminal illnesses.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
But later all this was
expanded and the whole field

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:90%
became a great area for healing.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:90%
And this deserves reflection.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there
are many phenomena

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that could give rise
to beliefs, or even

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
have some religions
evolve from them.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I have no doubt
that many of them

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
were formed because of
contacts with the supernatural

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:90%
from extraterrestrial contacts.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe on another
occasion we could

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
go into more detail about the
mystery of apparitions of Mary.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
However, beyond the fact
that UFO phenomenon is always

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
tiptoeing around this
type of experience,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.090 align:middle line:84%
it's a very
different story when,

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
from a pure original contact, we
tack on our beliefs, generating

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%
rituals and worship.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:90%
And all that can be distorted.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
has happened somehow

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:84%
with these people these days
who venture to the Aurora Ranch.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Tonna and his family felt
overwhelmed and decided

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to close the ranch
to the public,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
today they do not
allow anyone to enter.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:90%
But that has not been enough.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
People camp outside the
gates, even to this day.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I must say, I met Ángel Tonna
and his family personally.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:84%
He's already passed,
but I remember him

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:90%
as an exceptional guy.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
He was not the typical
contact witness who sometimes,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
after these types
of experiences,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
transforms into a distant
strange person who

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:84%
could erroneously believe
that they are someone

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
special, different from
others who projects themselves

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to people as an expert,
as a type of guide,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
or cosmic guru for those who
believe in their experience.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that's very dangerous,
because contact witnesses are

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
just everyday people
who experience

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:90%
something incredible.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the humblest who
I have met on my journey

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is Mr. Tonna, the
typical Uruguayan rancher

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.880 align:middle line:84%
who greeted you with a
mate tea, that classic

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
drink so typical of
Uruguay, Argentina,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and other countries
of South America

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:90%
where it has its native origins.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.730 align:middle line:84%
He welcomed me into his
home with a mate tea.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It's really wonderful to
share with such a person,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
so down to Earth,
so kind, so sincere.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And with him I had an experience
that I really didn't expect.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Tonna welcomed me into his home,
and I had had the opportunity

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to make contact with him,
thanks to a dear, mutual friend,

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:55.118 align:middle line:84%
my dear Gloria Libertad, who
currently lives in Uruguay.

00:09:55.118 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And Tonna welcomed us with
extraordinary kindness

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and showed me, while
we drank mate together,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:84%
the animals that
had been dissected

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
in that strange
manifestation of lights.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And the explosion of
the ombu tree in 1976.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
photographs of
personalities, including

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific field,
who had visited the place,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But I was struck by his
story that US astronaut, Neil

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.865 align:middle line:90%
Armstrong, visited Uruguay.

00:10:25.865 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean the official visit
made to Uruguay by the Apollo

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
11 mission astronaut,
but another secret visit,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:84%
which, strictly according
to Ángel Tonna's testimony,

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:90%
occurred on his ranch.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
The American astronaut had
traveled, according to Tonna,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:90%
by land from Argentina.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
He arrived in Uruguay
and met with him.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Tonna even showed
me a photograph

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
which, unfortunately, I
don't have in my possession.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:90%
He just showed it to me.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And in it was a
man with a baseball

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:90%
cap and tinted glasses.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:90%
It was allegedly Mr. Armstrong.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
According to Tonna,
the astronaut

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.740 align:middle line:84%
was investigating several
places of contact,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
different phenomenon
in South America,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:84%
since it was, according
to what Neil told him,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:84%
part of an initiative for
paranormal research, which

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
was obviously under
the veil of his trip

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
as a distinguished visitor.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:10%
If this is so, I
wouldn't be surprised,

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.970 align:middle line:10%
since the American
astronaut belonged

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:10%
to various esoteric
groups, including

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.400 align:middle line:10%
his membership in
the Freemasons,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:10%
and also his well-known visit
that I already mentioned

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:10%
to the Cave of the Tayos.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The conversation with
Tonna was very relaxed,

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
when suddenly he said
to me, out of nowhere,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:90%
do you want to meet Maya?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:90%
And this got my attention.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Tonna said that after the
sightings and these objects,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
some beings of light, of
energy, had manifested

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
themselves, which he linked with
the appearance of these UFOs,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
beings who introduced themselves
by name, identifying themselves

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
as entities of energy,
of light, and one of whom

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:90%
was the aforementioned Maya.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:90%
I really didn't believe him.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I must be honest
in acknowledging that.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I had the feeling
that he wasn't lying.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:90%
His experience was very solid.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And those of us who have
faced this type of contact,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:84%
when we hear other
people's experiences.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But to ask me out of nowhere,
let's leave the ranch

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and you will meet Maya,
it seemed to me that it

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:90%
was, I don't know, impossible.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:84%
We left, it was nighttime, and
I remember that a light appeared

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:90%
in the distance.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a firefly
that was blinking at us.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, as the light
descended, becoming stronger,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:90%
it was not a firefly.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
At least I had never seen
one so big and bright.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly it disappeared.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that was Maya,
she came to greet you.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, wow, was that a
gigantic firefly that lit up

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
just when we went out there.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
How did Tonna know that
this was going to happen.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Is he kidding with me?

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
My experience
concluded in Uruguay.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I took my flight back to Peru.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
At that time I
still lived in Peru.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that during
the flight I fell asleep

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and had a lucid dream,
where I saw myself

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
with a female figure made of
light with feminine features,

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:90%
a female silhouette.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And she said to me, I'm Maya.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Now you are seeing
me in this form.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I was present at Tonna's ranch.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
You saw me as a sphere of light.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:90%
I said, this can't be.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:10%
What happened to me at
that ranch in Uruguay

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:10%
has affected me so much that
I'm dreaming in mid-flight.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I woke
up, because a child

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:84%
had unbuckled his
seatbelt and started

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
running down the aisle of the
plane shouting, Maya, Maya,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Maya.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And his mother quickly
went to get him.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
She brought him back to his
seat and put his seatbelt

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:84%
back on as if the
child were playing

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
with an imaginary friend.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I got goosebumps and said,
no, something extraordinary

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
happened, and I have to open
my mind to the possibility

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that Maya exists,
and that this contact

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
with that alleged entity
of light was genuine.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
What's more, Ángel
Cristo Acoglanis,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:84%
the Argentine esoteric
and chiropractor,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
when visiting Ángel Tonna,
received information

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that this kind of being
also manifested themselves

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
in another place in Argentina,
at the mythical Mount Uritorco.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:84%
The case of Mount
Uritorco is so extensive,

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:84%
we could do several episodes
about this mystical mountain,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
which stretches to
almost 6,000 feet

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains of Córdoba
in the heart of Argentina.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
It is very famous, because in
1986, an unidentified flying

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
object appeared, a type of
ship described by witnesses

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.760 align:middle line:84%
as a lenticular object
radiating reddish light.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.740 align:middle line:10%
I am referring to the family
of Dona Esperanza Gomez.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:90%
This occurred in January of '86.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And later a discovery was
made on a nearby mountain, not

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:84%
exactly Uritorco,
but the Paharillo

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:84%
mountain of immense impressions
of more than 150 feet wide,

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:90%
and more than 300 feet long.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics, when they
saw all of this

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:84%
said this was a fire
set to attract tourism

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
to Capilla del Monte, the town
at the base of Mount Uritorco.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
However, the supposed
fire had gone

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:84%
from the top down, that
is, the heat had burned

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:90%
the bushes from the top down.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a traditional forest
fire that burns from the roots.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
In addition, with the winds in
the mountains a fire cannot be

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
confined to an oval spot,
such as what you're seeing

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:90%
in the picture.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It was also said
that it had been

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
an Argentine military
experiment, the Condor

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
experiment, with a missile
that was to have hit there.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the case,
where is the crater?

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Skeptics began to spew
other explanations,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:84%
saying it could have been
a circular electric bolt,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:90%
lightning produced by a storm.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, to date,
no one can agree.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Was it the energy projected
by the alleged 1986 UFO

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
on El Paharillo mountain
as researcher Jorge Suarez

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
believed?

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
impressions on El Paharillo,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
on Uritorco, there was talk
of a tradition of the natives,

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
a very controversial oral
tradition, difficult to prove.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to the Henia
and Kamiare Native groups,

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
known as the Comechingones, who
are said to have had contact

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:84%
with lights that
communicated with them

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:84%
through shamanic rituals, like
some researchers interpreted

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:84%
from the pictograms of Mount
Colorado, the way I see it,

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:84%
another contact location in
the mountains of Cordoba.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, beyond these
mysteries it is clear

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that Mount Uritorco,
and its surroundings,

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
such as Terrones or the
grottoes of Ongamira

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.510 align:middle line:84%
have already reported spiritual
experiences and contact

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
with those lights long ago.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Before these impressions on El
Paharillo, the incident in 1986

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.550 align:middle line:84%
secured a place on the
world ethological map

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
for Mount Uritorco and the
town of Capilla del Monte.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But what interests us here is
an even more disturbing subject,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.250 align:middle line:84%
what Ángel María
Tonna in Uruguay

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
had reported to Ángel
Cristo Acoglanis,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
the Argentine esoteric,
that these beings have also

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.750 align:middle line:84%
shown themselves in the
Mount Uritorco area.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And many people report to
have seen the same lights that

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:84%
appeared on Las Gemelas Mountain
on Mount Uritorco and Cuchi

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Corral, even in Ongamira
in different places

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.850 align:middle line:84%
of this wonderful region, lights
that approached the witnesses

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and communicated with
them telepathically.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:90%
What were they facing?

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.130 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Were they extraterrestrial
entities linked

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to these sightings?

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Or are we facing
another mystery.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
On occasion in interviews
that I have given at Gaia

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about a
contact that I experienced

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
in the Caves of Cusco, precisely
in 1998, before meeting

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Ángel Maria Tonna.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
That contact
occurred in the Cave

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
in Zone X. I descended into
these underground labyrinths,

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:84%
which are relatively close
to the Temple of the Ray

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of Sacsayhuamán, when a light
emerged like a bright haze that

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
took the form of an
elongated entity.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't alone
when I saw it.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.062 align:middle line:84%
I was accompanied by a
witness, Sergio Casares

00:19:24.062 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Huamán a researcher
of Andean esotericism.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
We both saw it and
were left perplexed.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
this kind of being

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is the same that was later
reported by Tonna, and also

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
by contact witnesses
from Mount Uritorco?

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:84%
According to a certain
Andean tradition in Peru,

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:84%
that kind of being protects
the wak'a, the vortices

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth, the sacred places.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Some call them [NON-ENGLISH]
that can be associated with

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the ancestors,
as believed on Uritorco,

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.455 align:middle line:84%
that those lights,
like Maya, Uitaicom,

00:20:01.455 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] are simply the
spirits of the ancient natives

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
who, centuries ago, inhabited
these mountains of Cordoba,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:84%
as may have happened to
me in the Caves of Cusco.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.520 align:middle line:84%
However, the other version is
that the [NON-ENGLISH] may not

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:90%
be exactly spirits.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Energy, linked to ancient human
presence, native inhabitants,

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
but are conscious entities
of pure energy flowing

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in the vortices of the Earth who
are connected, for some reason,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
to UFO apparitions.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And not that they generate
the UFO phenomenon,

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:84%
but they have some kind of
interaction, or connection,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:90%
with the occupants of UFOs.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.410 align:middle line:84%
That is a much more complex
and convoluted issue.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.760 align:middle line:84%
On only one occasion, in the
vicinity of Mount Uritorco,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
was I able to repeat the
experience in Zone X in Cusco.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It was December 5th of 2015.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.950 align:middle line:84%
We were at the base of
Las Gemelas Mountain,

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:84%
a group of people doing contact
preparation and meditation,

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
when through telepathy, a
message from a being who called

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
himself Uitaicom, invited me
to approach a specific place

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
close to where we were.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
In that case I gave
in to my impulses

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and I walked toward an area
where there is a dirt road that

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.210 align:middle line:90%
leads into the forest.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I first saw two
lights that seemed

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
to be moving around the area.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But they were very
close together.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I found out
that it was a fox.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, my God, what now?

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm turning up at the alleged
invitation of these beings

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:84%
through the telepathic
communication that I mentioned,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and I end up walking around
in the middle of the night

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
to see what I can find,
and a fox appears.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Will this be a test?

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
much stronger light.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And I asked myself,
could it be a firefly?

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
That is, I tried to
apply what many of us

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:84%
call the protocol
of Occam's razor,

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
that being the simplest,
most rational explanation,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
we have to employ.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
If you were in your
house, for example,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and you hear a noise
in the kitchen,

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
it's most likely your cat, or
that the wind blew a window

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that you left open,
rather than it being

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:84%
the holographic projection
of an extraterrestrial.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to employ a
simple, rational explanation

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:90%
before magical thinking emerges.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.610 align:middle line:84%
However, that alleged
firefly, just like it happened

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to me at the Aurora Ranch,
with Ángel Maria Tonna,

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.530 align:middle line:84%
disappeared and reappeared
some feet away from me,

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
very close, a
bluish, white light.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And it started to stretch
up and down as if it

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:90%
were chewing gum, elastic.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And it took the shape of
a tall, thin figure, which

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:84%
reminded me greatly
of what I had

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.671 align:middle line:90%
experienced in Zone X in Cusco.

00:23:02.671 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And he told me, I am Uitaicom.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And then he disappeared,
not without leaving me

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:84%
with a series of
sensations and images

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:19.010 align:middle line:84%
in my head about a
project we were doing

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and continued
developing to this day

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
called the Roerich
Center, a cultural center

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.830 align:middle line:84%
linked to the awareness
of peace and the work

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:90%
of this Russian humanist.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me scenes from the
future of this center finished

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and many people
visiting it, trying

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
culture of peace as if--

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I say it here on camera as
a spontaneous reflection

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
as if these beings,
whoever they may be,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
were interested in
any human effort

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:90%
for the awareness of peace.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Of course, that is the case.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:10%
I am convinced, as
a contact witness,

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:10%
that these beings seek
human beings to become aware

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.050 align:middle line:10%
of our actions and
live in greater

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.860 align:middle line:10%
communication with the planet.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
Capilla del Monte,

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the
mythical Mount Uritorco,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most wonderful
natural sanctuaries,

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
like others that I've mentioned
throughout this program,

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and there I met that being
who calls himself Uitaicom.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Then, it was explained
to us in other messages

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and other experiences
that I've been

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.520 align:middle line:84%
able to verify with different
local contact witnesses,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that they can manifest
themselves more easily before,

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:90%
during, and after a storm.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
That is, storms
generate some kind

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensional access for
them to manifest themselves.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not in all cases,
but curiously, many

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.720 align:middle line:84%
of the contacts that have been
reported on Mount Uritorco

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
have occurred before,
during, or after storms.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.900 align:middle line:84%
By the way, an
important detail is

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that this region of the
mountains of Córdoba

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is considered one of
the areas of the world

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
with the greatest electrical
storm activity, so much so

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
that NASA sent its lightning
project to investigate it

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
since these storms generate
a lot of antimatter.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, something
to investigate.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Also, another fact of
interest is that in the area,

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:10%
there are several stone altars
used by the Comechingones

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:10%
and other cultures
that preceded them,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:10%
like the Ongamira culture,
or the [NON-ENGLISH] culture.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
They are like holes
in the rock that

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:84%
are filled with water
during the storms,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and through them, you
can observe the stars

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.810 align:middle line:90%
like a cosmic mirror.

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:84%
All this deserves
further research.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
We have published
our findings, but I

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
think that will be the
subject of another episode.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And another detail that I cannot
fail to mention is the code

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:90%
of contact with these beings.

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
resonance and sound,

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
as we discussed in other
episodes of the Arc of Time.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the mantras
in Irdin, a cosmic language

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
or ceremonial language,
which became very popular

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s in
Capilla del Monte,

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
but that, in reality, has
been present in contact cases

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:90%
since the '50s.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.710 align:middle line:84%
The aforementioned
Ángel Cristo Acoglanis

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:84%
was the one who worked the
most with these mantras

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.710 align:middle line:84%
in those years, at
least until 1989

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
when, unfortunately,
he was murdered

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
in his chiropractic
clinic in Buenos Aires.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
The cause of his death at the
hands of a fanatic follower who

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
shot him at
point-blank range has

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with these
experiences and contacts

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:90%
but with other personal matters.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And out of respect to the
family, I won't go into it.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that beyond
all these stories,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:84%
contacts have
continued to this day,

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and a sea of mystery
surrounds who Maya,

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] and
other beings are,

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
who seem to be the guardians
of the vortices of the Earth.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The Irdin vibration
code, the sound,

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.030 align:middle line:84%
does not mean anything
in particular.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Although you can associate
it with a cosmic language,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:90%
I think they are feelings.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Vibrations, they
are the frequencies

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that people who use these
vibrating channels to connect

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:84%
with them or with
other realities.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.510 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe these beings are not
so interested in what we say.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.380 align:middle line:84%
They are not so interested
in what we think

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
or in our intellect,
but they are

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.690 align:middle line:84%
more interested in how
we feel and how we act.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.030 align:middle line:90%
That is, how we resonate.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It may sound like magical
thinking or too mystical

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of an explanation,
but I am convinced

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that when we open our
hearts and vibrate

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:84%
in the frequency of
the magic of love,

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.510 align:middle line:84%
that's when incredible
experiences also happen.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happened
with my innocence

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
when I saw Maya, when I
entered the Cave of Cusco,

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
or when I accepted
that invitation

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
to meet the mysterious
Uitaicom in person.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned
from these experiences

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.940 align:middle line:84%
with these beings
of light is somewhat

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:84%
different from other
close encounters

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that we affirm to
have had with entities

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial origin,
such as the Alpha Centauri

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
episode and the manifestation
of beings like Ivika or Antarel,

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
which I have described
in multiple interviews.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
We're talking here
about beings of energy

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
which are interdimensional who
perhaps emerged like this, who

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
perhaps adapt to
the contact witness

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.060 align:middle line:84%
as a human figure or
silhouette, but that

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:90%
is not their original form.

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.110 align:middle line:90%
They are spheres of light.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
They live, proceed, or manifest
or arise from the nodes

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And although they have
transmitted impulses

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:84%
of information that
have been decoded

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
from telepathic,
psychographic communications,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
even in spiritual principles
or teachings related

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to the mysteries of Uritorco,
as we have previously published,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing is

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to find yourself face to
face with these beings

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
or at least become
aware of their existence

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:90%
to know that you are the same.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:28.020 align:middle line:84%
That you are the same, a sphere
of light who is transiently

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:90%
living the human experience.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Therefore you have
to have consciousness

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have
to necessarily look

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.120 align:middle line:84%
for a spiritual experience
because we are already spirits.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
We are living a human
learning experience,

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and you may not want
to remember contact

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:90%
with this type of being.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And since we have talked
about manifestations

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of beings of light,
our next journey

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
will take us to the origin
and destiny of souls

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
according to messages of
extraterrestrial origin.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm Ricardo González
Corpancho, and you

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.330 align:middle line:90%
are on board "The Arc of Time."
