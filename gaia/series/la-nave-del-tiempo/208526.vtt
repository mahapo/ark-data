>> Indiana Jones movies
popularized the idea of magical

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.580 align:middle line:84%
objects hidden in secret
areas of the world.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:10%
The search for the Ark of the
Covenant or the Holy Grail

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:10%
are two clear examples.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
However, there are other
relics of power unknown to us.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
One of these mysteries
is found in America.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to the
enigma of solar discs.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez Corpancho.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%
A world, according to alleged
extraterrestrial messages,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:84%
is a mutation process,
a gradual process,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:84%
which leads us to a higher
reality, an energy context

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.055 align:middle line:90%
unknown to the human species.

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And, apparently,
there are objects

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:84%
of power capable of interacting
with that vital field of light

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about a mystery
that we know as the solar discs.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:10%
You will recall that in the
episode about the enigma

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:10%
of the underground
world, I referred

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:10%
to a face-to-face encounter
that I had with a personage

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:10%
with Asian traits, who
emerged from the Amazon

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:10%
rainforest of Peru
in 1996 when I

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:10%
was on an expedition
in search for Paititi,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:10%
the lost city of the Incas.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:10%
This man, who introduced
himself with the name of Alcir,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:10%
claimed to be part of an
underground society that,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:10%
according to his information a
long time ago, for centuries,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:10%
had been living in silence
somewhere on the Pantiacolla

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:10%
plateau.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:10%
It is a very special region
of the Manu National Park

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:10%
in the southeastern
area of Peru,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:10%
a magical jungle that,
according to local natives,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
the Machiguengas, hides
archaeological mysteries

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:10%
and something more than
simply alleged pyramids

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.280 align:middle line:10%
covered by vegetation.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
According to some of these
natives, with whom I've

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
been able to share and interact
throughout these expeditions,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
there is a group of
beings, people like us,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
with other knowledge that are
part of unknown cultures, which

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
are hidden somewhere secret,
an underground sanctuary,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and that the Andean legends
called them the Paco

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Pacuris or the First Guardians.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Probably, these
legends are related

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
to that wonderful experience
that I had September 5,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
1996 at the mythical wall
of Pusharo, that rock

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
with wonderful
symbols that reminds

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:84%
the Machiguengas
of that connection

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
with other realities, because
they claim that that wall is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
a portal, a extrasensory
connection with the enigma

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.900 align:middle line:90%
of Paititi.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.750 align:middle line:84%
They say that through
this rock, they

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:90%
can connect with that secret.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.940 align:middle line:84%
At least the elders of
the Machiguenga community

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:90%
remember it in that way.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Some have even mentioned that
hands have come out of the rock

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
itself, like some ghostly
ethereal hands, not physical.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to embrace
them and take them

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
inside the Pusharo
wall, stories that

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been taken
out of science fiction

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
but do not surprise us.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Since these types
of places function

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
as portals that are activated
by unknown mechanisms, perhaps

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
activated by that
underground society related

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to the legend of the
white brotherhood,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
which we already mentioned,
the brotherhood of light

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
or the brotherhood
of the inner shrines

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:84%
represents that collective
of masters, descendants

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
of missing cultures
that are protecting

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
their inner sanctuaries,
the real history of humanity

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:84%
that, at some point, they
will reveal to the world.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:10%
Is it perhaps on
metallic plates,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:10%
like those allegedly
found by Juan MÃ³ricz

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:10%
in the Cave of the
Tayos, which may also

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:10%
be found in Mount
Shasta, as Brown

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:10%
observed in one of his
alleged expeditions

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:10%
into the inner world of
this California volcano.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Is this the same that we
might find in Paititi?

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the lost
city of the Incas,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
we would be referring to,
according to Alcir's account,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:90%
an underground kingdom.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you pay attention
to these images

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
of the wall of Pusharo, you
will see some small faces there,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:84%
the heart-shaped faces that
some mystics interpreted

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
as a representation
of a human heart

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
with faces, which are
associated with inner contact.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, I think
it means something else.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.170 align:middle line:84%
These faces appear
in other places

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:84%
than the jungles
of the Americas.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:90%
We can find them in Honduras.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
We also find these
representations in Cuela,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:84%
even in Polynesia in Rapa Nui,
also known as Easter Island.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.270 align:middle line:84%
According to my
research, when speaking

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
with local native
guardians, those

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
faces represent the guardians of
the underground world, that is,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
the Sunkies that I
talked about when

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
I referred to the mystery
of the Cave of the Tayos.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Wherever these faces are
found, whether on rock art

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
or in petroglyphs, there,
you will find tunnels leading

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.230 align:middle line:90%
to an underground mystery.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The Sunkies are guardians
of the labyrinths.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But those who protect the halls
of records, I mean to say,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:84%
those inner temples where
information is hidden by this

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
underground brotherhood
are the [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
a term used by Alcir to
self-define as a guardian

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:10%
And in that contact, Alcir
spoke to me of a tool of power,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:10%
a disc that appeared
to be golden,

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:10%
a golden disc that was
once in Coricancha,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:10%
the golden temple of Cusco.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But with the Spanish conquest,
the disc was taken to Paititi

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and, today, is in custody
of this alleged underground

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
brotherhood.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So from that experience
at the wall of Pusharo,

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
with this strange man who
momentarily and unexpectedly

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
interrupted our
expedition, I began

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
to study in greater depth what
the meaning of this mystery

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:90%
of the solar disc is.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
something extraordinary.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The Incan solar disc,
according to Andean tradition,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.050 align:middle line:84%
summarized ancestral
worship that

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
predates any estimated period
surrounding the Tawantinsuyu

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:90%
empire.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Tawa means four;
inti, the midday sun;

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and suyu, region, that
is, the four regions

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.080 align:middle line:90%
of the great solar empire.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:10%
This disc was venerated in the
golden temple of Coricancha

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:10%
or Inticancha, the
place of the sun.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Beyond having been the center
of some kind of religious cult,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
that tool encompassed
a supernatural power,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
which the Spaniards
had no knowledge of.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
They were only
interested in gold.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, as
the story goes, they

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
looted everything that they
found in Coricancha, eventually

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
melting the
beautiful gold pieces

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to be carried off to Europe
as part of their plunders.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Some authors have
speculated that this

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
was the final destination
of the solar disc.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
other versions.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:10%
Historians report
that the solar disc,

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:10%
as a representation of Punchao,
the Incas' beloved sun,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:10%
was found on the main
facade of the Coricancha

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:10%
until Francisco Pizarro and his
conquerors entered the temple,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:10%
included among
the abundant loot.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It is said that Mancio
Sierra de Leguizamo's share

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:90%
was the immense gold disc.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
As the story goes, the
Spaniards used it as a game.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And it is said that that
soldier, a chronic gambler,

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
lost it that same night
on a bet, the disc,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
unspeakable drunkenness.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
From there, the disc's
whereabouts are unknown.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Some stories record, as I
said, that it was melted down,

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
while others maintained
that the disc

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
lays on the ocean floor inside
the sunken Spanish galleon that

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
attempted to transport
it to Europe.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
version that interests us,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:84%
which is confirmed by
the masters of the Andes,

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.170 align:middle line:84%
by the Andean
esoteric tradition.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.830 align:middle line:84%
This version ensures that the
disc found by the Spaniards

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
was just a gold replica, and
that the original disc was

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:90%
secretly taken to a safe place.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:10%
The mission was carried
out by the legendary Choque

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.555 align:middle line:10%
Auqui, the golden prince.

00:09:13.555 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.750 align:middle line:84%
He managed to outwit the Spanish
guard, thanks to a tunnel

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
connecting Coricancha to
the temple of SacsayhuamÃ¡n,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
the temple of lightning, on the
mount of the falcons, which,

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with a great view, currently
towers over the city of Cusco.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And from there, through other
tunnels and secret paths,

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:90%
he made his way to the jungle.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:10%
Choque Auqui, brother
of Inca Atahualpa,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:10%
was a warrior and a solar
initiate of the sun.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
He knew how to interpret what
the arrival of the Spaniards

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:90%
really meant.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
This is how he planned
the mission of Antisuyu,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
where the sun rises, the
southeastern jungle of Peru

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
through a secret route
to provide safekeeping

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
for the golden disc and
not only the golden disc,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
but also other relics of
the empire of the Incas.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It is said that he
did not leave alone.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
He was accompanied by
several amauta masters,

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
by information archivists,
quipucamayocs, willaq priests,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
virgins of the sun, acllas,
and also the nobles,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle line:90%
or orejones, and some warriors.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:84%
There is a wonderful
story that says

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that priests with great
supernatural power who

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:84%
could control the elements
guarded Choque Auqui's

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
expedition to prevent the
Spaniards from cutting them

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They are known in Peruvian
esoteric tradition

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
as altomesayoc.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
They are known in Peruvian
esoteric tradition

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:90%
as the altomesayoc.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a word that is also
comprised of Spanish because it

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
represents height, mass, or
prayer and yoc, which means

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
sent, that is, the envoys or
priests sent from the heights.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It is what is currently called
the community of Q'ero shamans

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:90%
in Paucartambo.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:10%
I've had the opportunity
to live with Q'ero

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.850 align:middle line:10%
natives, legitimate
descendants of the Incas.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And on my expeditions,
they narrated to me

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, Paititi
exists, and that they call it

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.510 align:middle line:90%
the secret name of QoaÃ±achoai.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And that their ancestors caused
avalanches with their alleged

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:84%
psychic powers rains and
storms to prevent the Spaniards

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:90%
from pursuing Choque Auqui.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
In short, the golden prince
founded the city of Paititi

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle, according
to this information,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
arising as the new
clandestine Inca.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:90%
All of this happened in 1533.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to
our investigations,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Choque Auqui did not
actually go to the jungle

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.340 align:middle line:84%
to build a shelter
in which to store

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:90%
the treasures of the empire.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he sought the
safety of the sanctuary

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:84%
of their invisible masters, the
Paco Pacuris, who we already

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:90%
mentioned.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Are beings, like
Alcir, with whom

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I had the experience in
1996, by any chance, part

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
of these legendary hidden
masters of the Incas?

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
That story, which protects
the underground brotherhood,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
is obviously not the
story that we know.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
We humans have a general
idea of our history

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
based on anthropological,
ethnic, archaeological,

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
studies, et cetera
that have allowed

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:90%
us to put together a map.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But we have many
gaps, especially

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:90%
from even more ancient times.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:10%
For our history,
civilization, as we know it,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:10%
originated approximately
Paititi years ago

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:10%
in Sumer in Mesopotamia.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But according to
these beings, there

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
were other civilizations
before the Great Flood,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:84%
before the last
great destruction.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And we'd lost all
the information

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:90%
about what that was.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.350 align:middle line:84%
That is, those annals of the
true history of humanity,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:84%
in general, speak of
other cultures that

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
disappeared cyclically, of other
civilizations that we consider

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
mythological,
legendary, impossible.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And only when we are ready,
and I mean current humanity,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
will we have access
to that information?

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.050 align:middle line:84%
We cannot possess it at this
time, because we do not have,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:84%
according to them, a sufficient
level of consciousness to merit

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:90%
such a great revelation.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, what would
we do with the knowledge

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that could transform us
into a cosmic society?

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, according to
them, also made mistakes.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
They discovered wonderful
manifestations of energy.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
They applied them, in
fact, to technology.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
But then all that
turned against them.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And they self-destructed, or
they generated an imbalance

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:90%
with the planet.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was nature, I might add,
that sank them into the oceans.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't want that
to happen again.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, they patiently
and discreetly guard

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
this information, the annals
of the true cosmic history

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.460 align:middle line:84%
The solar disc, therefore,
was an instrument

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
of power for ancient and unknown
civilizations that, for a time,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:90%
was in the hands of the Incas.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.660 align:middle line:10%
Currently, it would be with
its legitimate custodians

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.740 align:middle line:10%
in the underground sanctuary
that Alcir referred to, found

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:10%
in the jungles of Paititi.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:10%
As a curious fact, I
will say that at present,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.560 align:middle line:10%
the city of Cusco uses an
image of the solar disc

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:10%
as their emblem,
although not all

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:10%
are aware of the real
meaning of that symbol.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
The little that they know
is that the current design

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Cusco coat
of arms resembles

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
a description of
the solar disc that

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
was on a gold plate in the
Poquencancha, the Cusco art

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
gallery where the history
of the Incas was recorded.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
On the original
solar disc, there

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is a small representation
of pre-Hispanic origin

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
that ended up at the
American Indian museum

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:84%
in the capital city,
Washington, DC.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.400 align:middle line:84%
After an endless number of
formalities and requests,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
a very long story to tell,
finally, the American museum

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
consented to return the piece
to the Peruvian government

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:90%
in 2021, very recently.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the cosmic
story behind all of this?

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I warn you that the
information I'm about to share,

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.610 align:middle line:84%
for some will seem
impossible, even irrational.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
However, if true, everything
we received in our contact

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
experiences, which
we try to confirm

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
through our
investigations, we would

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
be facing an extraordinary
powerful revelation.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
In an ancient era,
humans on the Earth

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
developed interdimensional
capabilities,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.315 align:middle line:84%
which they were able to
embody into impossible objects

00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:55.115 align:middle line:90%
of power.

00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
We have already mentioned
in "The Arc of Time"

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:84%
the setting where this
story takes place--

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria, the ancient
cradle of the human race,

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that lost world which is located
between the southern coast

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
of East Africa and Madagascar
in the present day Indian Ocean.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:84%
There, in some distant time,
a giant gold disc was built,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:84%
an alloy with other
materials and vibrations,

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
frequencies to bind the Earth
to the matrix of the multiverse.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But that disc, according to
extraterrestrial messages,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
had to be deactivated since
it had been transformed

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:84%
into a dangerous experiment
by our ancestors who

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
were interacting with
various realities.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.610 align:middle line:84%
To deactivate it, it had to be
separated into 12 parts, which

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:90%
were hidden across the world.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
These 12 parts, over
time, would be transformed

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
into 12 secondary discs
about 10 feet in diameter,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.120 align:middle line:84%
which would be
magnetically assembled

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
by making disc number 13
the great solar disc that

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:90%
is currently in Paititi.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
As if it were of a prophecy,
according to this information,

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
the 13th disc will be placed in
places of power in the Americas

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
and Antarctica to help
the planet balance

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
its magnetic transformation
toward the future.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:84%
This process, according
to these messages,

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:84%
has been increasing in
strength since 2012,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
as we already analyzed
in another episode,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the end of the 13th baktun
of the Mayan calendar

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of the
symbolic 14th baktun,

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
the 144,000-day cycle or
400 years of transformation.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But why is the current
location of the discs

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:90%
concentrated in the Americas?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:84%
The initiates from the
east know very well

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that the energy of the Americas
is more active than anywhere

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:90%
else in the world.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It's what some mystics
call the transfer

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Kundalini of the Earth.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini, the backbone of
energy, which, in other times,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:84%
had its base in the
Himalayas and today

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:90%
allegedly thrives in the Andes.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Because of this,
the solar discs will

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:84%
have been placed in this
region of the world following

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:90%
a strategy of energy.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The plan is related
to the activity

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of the so-called
Pacific Ring of Fire,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in which is concentrated an
overwhelming 90% of the world's

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.180 align:middle line:90%
earthquakes.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
According to the messages
from the extraterrestrials,

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:84%
the sector that
corresponds to the Americas

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:84%
will have a lot of
energy downloads

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:84%
in the medium term with the
Nazca Plate and South America

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:90%
on center stage.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:84%
In addition, as if all
this were not enough,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
this network of
solar discs is also

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
connected to the changes in
the terrestrial magnetosphere.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.460 align:middle line:84%
That's not something
to be taken lightly.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
If the Earth keeps losing
its magnetic field,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
we could live in a
magnetic inversion

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
with all the consequences
that this implies.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, NASA
began to become aware

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of this when their spacecraft
experienced countless anomalies

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
over the skies of South America
because the magnetosphere had

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:90%
a localized weakness.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:10%
Scientists called
this phenomenon

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:10%
the anomaly of the
South Atlantic,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:10%
the same area in which the
majority of the solar discs

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:10%
are found.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Coincidence?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
The South Atlantic
Anomaly is a region

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
where the Van Allen radiation
belts are just a mere 124

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%
miles from the Earth's surface.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Scientists assumed that
this localized depression

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's magnetic
field is a side

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
effect of a possible
geomagnetic reversal.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:10%
In addition, we must not forget
that the South Atlantic Anomaly

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.080 align:middle line:10%
is of great importance for
satellites and other spacecraft

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:10%
orbiting at 100 of
miles of altitude,

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:10%
with orbital inclinations
of 35 and 60 degrees,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:10%
since these orbits
periodically take

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:10%
these satellites
through the anomaly,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:10%
exposing them to strong
radiation for several minutes.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you will remember
the International Space

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:35.160 align:middle line:84%
Station required special
armor to address this problem.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What the official media omits is
that this phenomenon could also

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
influence the climate balance,
even in biological life,

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and the behavior
of human beings,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
because we are magnetic
creatures made up of energy.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And here I wonder, would it
be possible for solar discs

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
to express a magnetic assistance
to deal with these anomalies?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's very
difficult to corroborate.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:10%
From what these beings
indicate and their contact

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:10%
with different
groups in the world,

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:10%
trips were made to the places
where these discs are, places

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:10%
that coincide with contact
areas, such as Mount Shasta,

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:10%
the Valley of the
Seven Luminaries,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:10%
Roraima, the Cave of the Tayos,
Lake Titicaca, Talampaya,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:10%
or the Atacama Desert,
the Licancabur volcano,

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:10%
to be precise, plus another
disc that was already

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.920 align:middle line:10%
moved outside the Americas
and located on the Antarctic

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.880 align:middle line:10%
Peninsula.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:10%
All these trips and
expeditions sought

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:10%
to verify the information.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And on those journeys,
extraordinary phenomena

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:84%
occurred, sightings, paranormal
manifestations, new messages,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
even certain seismic activity in
the area when these expeditions

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:90%
were carried out.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, no one
physically saw these discs.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
There is no current
archaeological finding.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:84%
However, we could perceive
through nonphysical experiences

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
that these discs
are located there.

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And everything went along
with these experiences

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:90%
that I'm describing.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.490 align:middle line:90%
What was the goal?

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
In those years, that
travel so long ago,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.500 align:middle line:84%
we were attempting to connect
through these tools so they

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
could reactivate and, as
if they had their own life,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.580 align:middle line:84%
awaken and maintain
a flow of energy,

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
which the extraterrestrials
call the network of time.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
When we shared this
information, great interest

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:90%
was generated in the subject.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
I must say that I was the
one who originally received

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.720 align:middle line:84%
this information on the
solar discs in a contact

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:84%
experience in Peru
back in 2001, that is,

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:90%
more than 20 years ago.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.890 align:middle line:10%
And this information that the
extraterrestrials transmitted

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:10%
has become very popular
among different contact

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:10%
groups and many spiritual
circles and mystery seekers.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
clarify that it has never

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
been my intention to promote
a search for these discs,

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:84%
to seek out experiences in the
places where they might be.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the expeditions
to these points

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
were already carried
out with a lot of effort

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
on our part to try to
understand the enigma,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:84%
but not to promote an irrational
chain of trips to those places.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I have seen that travel
agencies have even popped up

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to promote events
in places where

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:90%
solar discs are to be found.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we made these trips
to verify the UFO activity

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:84%
in the area and to try to
confirm the phenomena that

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.100 align:middle line:90%
are recorded there.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It must be clear that a search
must be based on research.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But you should not
orient yourself only

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:90%
by external factors.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Places of contact,
I have always said,

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
are just mirrors that
show us who we really are.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And when we
investigated this issue

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of solar discs and
their connection

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to the process of the energetic
mutation of the Earth,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I remembered how
the Spanish conquest

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
tried to take possession of
the gold or any relic of power

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that, for them,
could be important,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
not because of its
spiritual significance,

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.750 align:middle line:90%
but to eliminate idolatry.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:10%
This would take us
back to the times

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:10%
of the search for the
Lance of Longinus, the Holy

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:10%
Grail, the Ark of the
Covenant, which, by the way,

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:10%
as with the solar disc,
several copies were also made

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:10%
to outwit treasure hunters.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The message of the solar discs
is not one of treasure hunting

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:90%
or hypothetical tools of power.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:84%
It is simply
understanding that there

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
is a mechanism that is
supernatural, wonderful,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.920 align:middle line:84%
coordinated by nonhuman
entities to silently help

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
the planet on its way to a
higher sphere of consciousness.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But this does not
guarantee or replace

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
anything, because it is the
inner sun that should shine

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.290 align:middle line:90%
first before these solar discs.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:84%
From an archaeological
point of view,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:84%
it is very difficult to
verify this information.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But I consider that the energy
emanated from these discs

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
is something much more important
than the physical search

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
In the contact experience,
we were transmitted a series

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:84%
of codes, vibrations of
tonal frequency, so to speak,

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.820 align:middle line:84%
which, when evoked
like a mantra,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
allowed people to
connect to this force.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:84%
With this frequency,

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:84%
a connection that the
extraterrestrials themselves

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
suggested in their
communications

mantra has become well-known.

it in their concentration

Now it is time, as
the Andean shamans

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:05.730 align:middle line:84%
would say, to make our inner
inti shine, our inner sun,

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
to transform ourselves
into suns on Earth.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:84%
that we are also being of
light, of energy, suns on Earth.
