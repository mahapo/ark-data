>> Is there a date for
the end of the world?

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:84%
In studying Mayan
prophecies, many believe so.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But the interpretation
turned out to be wrong.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Ten years after
the mythical 2012,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:84%
let's analyze together
the misunderstood message

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of this fabulous civilization.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.950 align:middle line:84%
As we saw in the
previous episode,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
according to Hopi
leader White Bear,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:84%
the kachinas, their gods
from the Pleiades stars,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
rescued the survivors of
the submerged Kasskara

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120 align:middle line:90%
to take them to America.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
One of those places, like I
mentioned, was Mount Shasta.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But White Bear also
talked about other places,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
like the mythical
Palenque in Chiapas.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about one of
the most important scenarios

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:10%
of the Mayan culture, where
the Temple of the Inscriptions

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:10%
is found, and the
mysterious tomb

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:10%
lid of King Pakal
Votan, which inspired

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:10%
the imagination of the theorists
of the ancient astronauts--

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:10%
researchers, such as, for
example, Soviet scientist

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:10%
and writer Alexander Kazantsev.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It has been interpreted
that the Mayan priest was

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
aboard some type of
rocket or flying vehicle

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and that Pakal's hands
seem to operate levers.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
As we see in the image, his
feet, in dynamic motion,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
also seem to be stepping
on some kind of pedals.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
His head is also visibly
resting on a support.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And next to his
nose, you can see

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:90%
some kind of breathing device.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Pakal's gaze is looking at what
would be the bow of the ship.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:10%
And at the bottom
of the mask, there

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:10%
appears to be a plume of flames
coming out, which corresponds

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:10%
to the propulsion of a rocket.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Irrefutable evidence, or
pareidolia, as the skeptics

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:90%
call it?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
The official version
of the archaeologists

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the stone
shows the ascension

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of Pakal Votan from the
underworld into the sky.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that, to this
day, the debate continues.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the Maya had
contact with extraterrestrials?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Could they be, by
chance, descendants

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
of lost cultures dating
from antediluvian times?

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
If so, theorists of
ancient astronauts

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
think that legacy could explain
this culture's obsession

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:90%
with time and prophecies.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
doubt that the Maya

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:84%
were one of the most
important civilizations

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
According to official
history, this culture

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
emerged in Mesoamerica
around the year 25,000 BC.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But a good number
of scholars suspect

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that the roots of
this civilization

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.830 align:middle line:84%
could be dated back
thousands of years.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the Maya
inherited the foundation

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:10%
for their system of calendars
from those ancient cultures.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:10%
We are talking about a
complex time measurement

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:10%
system in which a solar
calendar called Haab stands out,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.200 align:middle line:10%
a 365-day civil calendar,
and a mystical lunar

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:10%
ceremonial calendar called
Tzolkin, with 260 days,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:10%
and the so-called Long Count,
a much broader calendar, which

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:10%
extends over a period
of thousands of years.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This Long Count was
begun mythically

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:90%
around the year 3113 BC.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And it corresponds to a
period of 5,125 years composed

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:90%
of 13 baktuns.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Each of these baktuns
contains 144,000 days.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
These 13 baktuns that are
to have started, as I said,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:84%
in 3113 BC, would culminate
sometime on the 21st or 22nd

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:90%
of December of the year 2012.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And this led to multiple
interpretations.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, the diehard
doomsayers and catastrophists

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
thought that the Maya had
prophesied the end of the world

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
since our planet, according
to old native traditions,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
had gone through different
cycles of destruction,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
either by fire or by water,
as the Hopi Indians believed,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:84%
or as it is also apparently
immersed in Mayan beliefs.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
However, at no time
did the Maya talk

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:84%
about there being
an end of the world

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:90%
when their Long Count finished.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Others interpreted it
quite differently--

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:84%
that from the year 2012, a
gradual path of transformation

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
for humanity would begin,
historically, spiritually,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
which would generate
a great mutation,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:84%
not just for our species,
but all over the planet.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But within that
interpretation, some mystics

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.460 align:middle line:84%
were convinced that
as of December 21,

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
the Earth would
make a giant leap--

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
the ascension to a higher
dimension of consciousness,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
being that, the reconnection
with the previously discussed

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
real universe time,
the fourth dimension,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:90%
or real time of the cosmos.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Or some even spoke
of a fifth dimension,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of a frequency of the fifth
stage, or the fifth scenario,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
as also referenced in
some channeled text.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But by all accounts,
none of that happened.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Nor did the catastrophe
that many had interpreted,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.980 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, was
depicted in television series,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
as well as catastrophic
films like "2012."

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Nor was there a great
dimensional leap

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
of humanity to the fourth
or the fifth dimension.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So both the catastrophists
and the diehard mystics

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
were completely disappointed.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, the Maya
never talked about it.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
They simply had a
system of time to mark

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the end of one historical cycle
and the beginning of another.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, according
to our contact experiences,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
of course we are moving
towards higher spheres

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%
But that path is gradual.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
The path is step by step.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And we still have
to continue going

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:90%
through learning experiences.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I would ask our audience
who is watching right now,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
do you think that we are
already in the fourth and fifth

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.120 align:middle line:90%
dimensions?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that we have
already overcome our problems?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that our humanity
is already in that frequency,

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
vibrating in another
time-space reality?

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But we could achieve
it if we correctly

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
understand the messages
and we do not distort them.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
One detail that caught my
attention in a powerful way

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
within the numeric message
of the Long Count of the Maya

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:90%
is the number 144,000.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
As I said, every baktun
contains 144,000 days.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And that has been interpreted,
in a mystical way,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that this number comprises
the critical mass needed

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:90%
to transform future events--

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
a number, as I have mentioned
on other occasions, which

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
also appears in the Bible
in John's vision of the Isle

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%
of Patmos, the apocalypse.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
This led to a channel
calling herself Antara Amara

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.950 align:middle line:84%
to promote a great
gathering of many people

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
in different parts of the
world to gather the 144,000 who

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
would vibrate in this frequency
based on the Maya prophecies.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the big gatherings,
the starting point,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
was the harmonic convergence
in the year 1987,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
which brought together different
consciousness and New Age

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
That was the beginning of the
meetings of the 11:11 portals.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
According to Antara Amara's
channeling and initiatives,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
they had to bring
many people together

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
in the world in
places of contact

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and places of power in states
of awareness and meditation

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
to elevate the
frequency of the Earth.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And they celebrated the
first 11:11 portal in Egypt

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:90%
in the year 1992.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Since then, these New
Age 11:11 ceremonies

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:84%
have been practiced to this
day, although I must also

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
say that all this
has been distorted.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that,
because of the simple fact

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
that, on Gregorian calendars,
numbers add up to 11

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.890 align:middle line:84%
or the date contains
that number,

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.530 align:middle line:84%
an interdimensional
portal is going to open.

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And that is just not so.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It's true that numbers have a
great vibration, a great power.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And they can amplify
our power of intention.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:10%
But to say that because
a determined number

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:10%
on a calendar as inaccurate as
the Gregorian calendar alluding

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:10%
to the figure 11 is a guarantee
that a dimensional portal will

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:10%
open--

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:10%
that is a belief that has
very little foundation.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it is wonderful
that different spiritual groups

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
in the world meet
in places of power,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
meditating and thinking
about a better world.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:90%
We must support that.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's fantastic.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remember
how these meetings began,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:84%
which are based on the
harmonic convergence

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Mayan prophecies and
in the cycle of calendars

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:90%
that are so misunderstood.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Other information related
to the mystery of the Maya

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:84%
relates to our sun and its
activity with the Earth.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
While it is true that the
Maya did not refer exactly

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to the mass coronal
ejections of the sun,

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
apparently, they
did have knowledge

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.790 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
occurs on the sun

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
could affect the
balance of the Earth.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
At least, that tradition
and that belief

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:84%
is held by many ethnic
Mayan peoples to this day.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And it also reminds
me of the belief

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of the Hamawt'as, of the
wise masters of the Andes.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Just like their
ancestors, the Incas,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
they believe that everything
that happens with the sun

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%
can affect the Earth.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
That's how a mystical
interpretation

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
of Mayan prophecies came
about, claiming that Hunab

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Ku, mentioned in
Mayan tradition,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:90%
in the beliefs of this culture--

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
it is nothing more nor less
than the supermassive black hole

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that is found at the
center of our galaxy,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and that it would have some
effect through a synchronizing

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:90%
beam.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.790 align:middle line:10%
Interpreted as such, the
Maya didn't say that exactly.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was interpreted like
that through modern channeling,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
which they attempted to
combine with this knowledge.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And that synchronizing
beam would reach our sun,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:90%
affect our sun.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And from our sun,
extraordinary things

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
would happen in the solar
system and especially on Earth.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It is curious that in the year
2012, the year of the Maya,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
the year of the end
of the Long Count,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
there was unusual
activity on the sun, which

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
appears to have had some effect
on the Earth's magnetosphere.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But it must also be noted
that these phenomena have

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
been repeated
throughout recent years.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Scientists officially think that
climate change and everything

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that is happening on our planet
has no connection with the sun.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:84%
However, other scholars,
like scientist Paul LaVallee,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:90%
think otherwise.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.130 align:middle line:84%
He's convinced that
activity on the sun

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
has a very important connection
not only with the Earth's

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
climate, but also with the
behavior of human beings,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.420 align:middle line:84%
something that I will
discuss in greater

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:90%
detail in the next episode.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
In any event, the Maya
intended to represent, perhaps,

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
certain cosmic phenomena
in their traditions,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in their myths, even in the
famous ballgame with the rubber

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:84%
ball that they hit
with their elbows,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
that they hit with their hips,
which could contain information

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic characteristics,
which perhaps involve the sun,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
the center of the galaxy,
and the cosmic evolution

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and
of human beings.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I think that this episode
has been important in order

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to understand something.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
First, in order to study the
cultures of the ancient world,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:84%
we have to be very careful to
separate our interpretations,

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
our esoteric and mystic visions,
and contact from existing

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
tradition, folklore,
archaeology, and history.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:90%
That happened with the Maya.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why many scholars
quoted them with things

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that they never
said, interpreting

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
the end of the world or a
jump into a higher dimension.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:84%
However, it is
important to combine

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
those legends and
that information

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
and those numeric calendars with
what you could be developing

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%
in genuine contact experiences.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
The intent of this
episode is so that you

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.980 align:middle line:84%
can see it in this
perspective and understand

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
that, in 2012, nothing ended.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.720 align:middle line:10%
We haven't achieved
anything yet.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
We have simply
started a new cycle.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And that cycle lasts
a very long time.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:10%
But now we are laying the
foundation for that building.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
That is the main
message of this episode,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we should
keep moving forward,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:84%
that the process is
still not finished.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
In addition to all this,
there are some interpretations

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Maya codices, those
that survived the unfortunate

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
burning by Diego de Landa
during the Spanish conquest.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
One of these
interpretations speaks

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
of the encounter with
the lords of the stars

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
in the codex of
eclipses, one of which

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
was accurately indicated by
them in 1991, visible in Mexico

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:90%
The eclipse occurred.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And during that celestial
event, several UFO sightings

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
were recorded, Unidentified
Flying Objects.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And many researchers, like
my friend Jaime Maussan,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
wondered at that time
if those objects--

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
if those lights that were
being video recorded in Mexico

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
had something to do
with Mayan codices

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
or with the alleged
prophecy that

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
spoke of the return of
the lords of the stars.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why some
traditions talk about how

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
the secret Mayan masters arrived
on Earth through a hollow reed

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
or serpent's tail from
Pleiades, as if it

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
were a wormhole for an
interdimensional journey,

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
bringing beings
from other worlds.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:10%
Many wonder if the pyramids
of Mexico and its cultures

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:10%
and everything that has
been developed there

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:10%
is of extraterrestrial origin.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:90%
In my opinion, no.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
All this was done
by human beings--

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
wonderful information that
generated from living on Earth,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:84%
which could have
been influenced by

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
or which may have had
some kind of connection

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%
with visits from
beings of other worlds,

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or even with survivors
of those lost

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
kingdoms, which I have
already referenced

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:90%
in "The Arc of Time."

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Do Mexico's UFOs from
1991 represent the return

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of the lords of the stars?

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And did they have
some kind of contact

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:90%
with our ancestors in America?

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
Long Count of the Maya

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and the cycles of
time, which involve

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of a 14th
baktun, symbolically, since,

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:84%
for some specialists,
the Long Count

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:84%
repeats itself,
those 5,125 years.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And for others, when
the 13th baktun ends,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.440 align:middle line:90%
baktun number 14 begins.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
That is to say,
right now, humanity

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.950 align:middle line:84%
would be going through its
144,000 days of transformation,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
which is a cycle equivalent
to 400 years, which I'm going

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:90%
to refer to in a few moments.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
But apart from all that,
there is another prophecy

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
circulating in Mexico,
a prophecy that

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
has been transmitted through
the oral tradition, which

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.640 align:middle line:90%
speaks of the return--

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:90%
the Mayan superior council.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:84%
In the Popol Vuh, it is
said that human beings were

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
originally created by a
council of 13 masters, created

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:90%
from corn.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:10%
And oral traditions assert this
council of 13 cosmic masters,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:10%
or whoever they
are, will resurface

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the time at the
peak time of human learning.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:10%
And these 13 great
cosmic consciousnesses

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:10%
would be embodied or would
materialize in crystal skulls,

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:10%
like the famous
crystal skull that

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.584 align:middle line:10%
was found by explorer
Mitchell-Hedges in Lubaantun,

00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:16.384 align:middle line:10%
Belize.

00:17:16.384 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the Mayan
skulls that are circulating

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.060 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed that the
Maya did not create them,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
but they had guarded
them, since it

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
would have been very
difficult for them

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.570 align:middle line:84%
to have been able to
polish a piece of quartz

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.490 align:middle line:90%
with such perfection.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there are many
fraudulent crystal skulls

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that may be found on the
black market in Mexico.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But here, I'm talking
about 13 authentic skulls

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:84%
that are hidden not exactly in
Mexico, but in different parts

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You may recall one of
the sequels of the movie

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
"Indiana Jones," which was
inspired by this legend.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The explorer, an
archaeologist, in the end

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.200 align:middle line:84%
meets the 13 gods, or the
13 creators of humanity,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:90%
through the crystal skulls.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And these 13 gods, according
to the "Indiana Jones" movie,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.600 align:middle line:90%
were extraterrestrials.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Is this what the
Popol Vuh is trying

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
to tell us-- that
life on Earth was sown

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:90%
by beings from other worlds?

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Allow me to return to
that 14th baktun cycle.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.790 align:middle line:84%
When I've had the
opportunity to meet

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
with these
extraterrestrial beings,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and we asked them, how long
does humanity need to generate

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.930 align:middle line:84%
the final change, we
were told, the change

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.300 align:middle line:84%
is gradual and
must be sustained.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It is assured that you
are going to achieve it.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
But this will not
prevent you from going

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
through different learning
trials, some very painful,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:84%
so that, in the
end, you can rise up

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:53.150 align:middle line:84%
as a cosmic civilization
and integrate with us.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
That process is going
to take 400 years.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:90%
How curious.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:10%
144,000 days is
equivalent to 400 years.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And the 14th baktun reminds
me of a very important

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.150 align:middle line:84%
esoteric number, which
may be a coincidence.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think, at this point,
nothing is by chance.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.900 align:middle line:84%
The number 14 represents
the return of the cycles.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It represents the return
of the great masters.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:10%
For example, in
Peru, it is believed

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:10%
that the 14th Inca, the one who
is hidden in Paititi, Inkarri,

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:10%
will return after
500 years of darkness

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:10%
to restore the
Pachacuti of light.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And if this were not
enough, in the Bible,

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
it says that, from Abraham
to David, from David

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
to the exile from Babylon, and
from the exile from Babylon

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.120 align:middle line:84%
to the birth of Christ,
14 generations go by,

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
like the 14 steps
that Jesus of Nazareth

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:84%
would have followed on the
way to later die on the cross

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and then resurrect, a
subject that we will

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:90%
explore in an upcoming episode.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
These very interesting
cycles that

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
take us to the 14th baktun
number and 144,000 days

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
seem to encompass
a pivotal message.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:84%
We are living in the definitive
times for transformation,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:84%
those envisioned
by great mediums,

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
like those mentioned before,
Parravicini, Edgar Cayce,

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:90%
or Nostradamus himself.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
According to
Antarel, of these 400

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
years, which started
in 2012, the first 13

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:90%
are very important--

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
that number 13 that the
Maya also considered

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:90%
to be a sacred cycle.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.030 align:middle line:84%
A great master
and 12 disciples--

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:90%
the magical priesthood--

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that is, from 2012 to 2025,
we are laying the foundation

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:90%
of that great transformation.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:10%
And we'll see what
is going to happen

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth in the
times that follow.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I have disseminated this
information since before 2012.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it has
had significant influence

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:84%
on many contact witnesses
and researchers.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And I continue to be
convinced of this information.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I believe in what has been said
by this being who calls himself

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Antarel, as well as in many
numeric and symbolic messages

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Maya.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
We are living the 144,000
days, the 14th baktun,

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to
change the future.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how could the
Maya and their predecessors,

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
the Olmecs, and other
cultures decode all this

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
in the magic of numbers,
in the magic of mathematics

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:90%
and calendars?

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because it's a perception
of the lines of time,

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:90%
of the infinite possibilities.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that,
in those numbers,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:84%
in that geometry
of the universe,

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:84%
is found the hidden evolution
of creatures and their learning

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:90%
experiences?

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that ancient
human civilizations cherished

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:90%
that knowledge.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And if there really
is a connection

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:84%
between extraterrestrial
messages

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and the calendars of
Mesoamerican cultures, in 2012,

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
that 13th baktun ended, a
transition of great changes

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.510 align:middle line:84%
imposed by the conquest
of many Native peoples.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And from this beginning
of the 14th baktun,

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:84%
we would gradually
need to rise above,

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind a
darkness and pain.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:10%
And after facing
those difficult times,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.480 align:middle line:10%
our humanity would resurface,
like that cosmic civilization

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:10%
that I've talked about so much.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials point out
that this process will take us

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.780 align:middle line:84%
some time, but we
can achieve it.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:90%
When does the 14th baktun end?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
It concludes, according to this
information, on March 25, 2407.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
On that date, will we
still be on the planet?

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:10%
Or will we be in the first
colonies on Alpha Centauri?

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we
will continue our search,

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and we will delve into the
mysterious solar disks.
