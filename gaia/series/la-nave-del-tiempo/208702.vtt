00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Human beings, are we just
a machine of flesh and blood,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:90%
a biological miracle?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Or as messages of
extraterrestrial origin

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
maintain, are we
journeying spirits who roam

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.200 align:middle line:90%
the worlds of the multiverse?

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez Corpancho.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:10%
Welcome aboard

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:84%
According to these
beings, humans

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:84%
are not just a
biological machine

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
that is triggered by
chemical impulses.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
There is something subtle
and, at the same time,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:84%
powerful that lies behind our
covering of flesh and blood,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:90%
a spark of light.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:90%
But what is its origin?

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And why are we now
on this planet Earth?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's examine
these controversies

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
together as a means for
revealing information.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
According to the
messages of these beings,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
our universe has an order, which
applies to both big phenomena

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:84%
as well as phenomena
we consider smaller.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
As hermetic principles would
say, as above, so below.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And as below, so above.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
According to our scientists,
this material universe

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:84%
in which we live was created
by a cosmic explosion,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
which they call the Big Bang,
approximately 14 billion years

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.130 align:middle line:84%
At some point, we mentioned
that from that incident,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
that singularity, the
space-time equation

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:90%
became plausible to us.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And these beings affirmed
that just as there

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:84%
was a cosmic explosion, which
came from a nonphysical place,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
according to them, to create
the stars and future planets,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.950 align:middle line:84%
something similar also
happened, a wonderful phenomenon

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
of creation so that journeying
spirits could arise.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Consciousnesses that arose
from the so-called cosmic ponds

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
or sources of life, that is what
these extraterrestrial beings

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:90%
call it.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, this multiverse has
a perfect geometric structure,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
where there are lines of energy
that are grouped in nodes.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And in these great
nodes, powerful energies

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:90%
flow, sources of life.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are sources
and more sources.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
The most important, obviously,
are within the galaxies

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
or in the large
nebula formulations,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
from which later arise
protoplanetary disks.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
According to this information
from the extraterrestrials,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:90%
our spirit is of cosmic origin.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
However, it does not proceed
from a material reality,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:84%
but from a mental
and spiritual reality

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
that humans, try as we
might, could not comprehend.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
From these clusters of
nontime arise the essence

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of the journeying spirit,
a journeying spirit

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
who can live the experience
of learning in matter,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:84%
incarnating in physical
bodies, and living

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
on planets in different
regions of the multiverse.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we are beings
of energy, journeying

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
spirits of cosmic origin,
why did we choose Earth?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Were we by chance
in other worlds?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Does life after this life
exist, reincarnation,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.510 align:middle line:84%
the succession of experiences
in different stars?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It is a very broad
and complex issue.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But according to these
messages, we may not only

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:90%
have one existence.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:84%
We could live
different existences

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:90%
as part of our learning.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And that learning would not
only be confined to one planet,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
as in the case of the Earth,
but in different worlds.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
The Earth, as we explained in
the episode on the cosmic plan,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
is a blue aura school
world, a special planet

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:90%
to come to and learn.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like this big university
where everyone wants to study.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Not an easy university,
difficult, but that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
forges the experience
of the journeying

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
spirit since whatever
is experienced

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
in the physical body in that
world, when the body dies,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:84%
the brain disappears,
and we return to dust.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
The information is not
going to disappear.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But as we have
already mentioned,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
it will be connected to,
logged into the records

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.680 align:middle line:84%
of the multiverse, what
some esotericists call,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the archives of the
memory of creation,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
or the so-called Akashic
matrix or records.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.480 align:middle line:84%
This information
is also mentioned

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:90%
by the extraterrestrials.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
have a connection

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
with these mystical
and esoteric teachings.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:84%
But I ask myself
again, why the Earth?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Did we choose it?

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Or did someone choose it for us?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how did that work?

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The universe, according
to these beings,

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
is structured with a
perfect energy management

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
law, where journeying spirits
are assigned according

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
to their frequency and what they
require and need from the world

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.385 align:middle line:90%
or stars for learning.

00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
According to these
messages, there

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
is even a group of
entities that we

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:84%
could call extraterrestrials,
but not ultraterrestrials,

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
who act as guardians of
destiny and could interact

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
with these journeying spirits
for the assignment to school

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:90%
planets.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
One might say, well, I'm living
the human experience on Earth.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
But why was I born
in the United States

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
or born in Peru or
in another nation?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Why were some born into families
with financial resources

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and others into families
that do not have them?

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:10%
Some who were born with
congenital problems

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:10%
and others who have
vigorous health,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:10%
why all these differences?

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Because even the
geography in your life

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:90%
can change your beliefs.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Being born and
raised in Afghanistan

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is not the same as being
born and raised in Israel.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, every experience
on Earth has a frequency,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
has information, and
is assigned accordingly

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to the affinity required
by the journeying spirit.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And, there, the
guardians of destiny

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
come into play or also
the lords of karma,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
as they are called in
some esoteric schools.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
These entities consider it
important for the spirit

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:84%
to live the experience
that corresponds to it so

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.180 align:middle line:84%
that its learning can
be much deeper and also

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:84%
faster in the upcoming path
of their future incarnations.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you this example.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about the little
ones, about our children.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
When they are so
small, they don't

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:90%
make decisions for themselves.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But we try to guide their
way through schooling,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
where they will study.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.060 align:middle line:84%
We also choose the
clothes they wear,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
their health, and a long list
of what we as parents attempt

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
to design in the best way
out of love and caring

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:90%
for our children.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Something similar happens with
the universe and the monitoring

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
entities of the universe,
the guardians of destiny,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
who try to choose the best, the
right thing for our learning.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Only when we have
sufficient consciousness,

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
sufficient spiritual maturity
as journeying spirits

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
may we interact in
decision-making.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And going back to
the previous example

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
of why I was born in a
more difficult family

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
or why I was born in
a more complex place

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to learn or to grow, I
guarantee that, according

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:84%
to this knowledge, the
most difficult places,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the most complex environments
are those that, in a better

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:90%
way, purge the spirit.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
In other words, calm seas do
not forge skillful sailors.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And there is a perfectly
established life arrangement,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
which is almost
like a highway where

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:84%
the human spirit, already
dressed as a human,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:90%
is traveling.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
coldly calculated

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
unless during that transit,
greater consciousness

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
is acquired, activating
a clause in that contract

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:90%
law in that life agreement.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:90%
And that clause is free will.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:10%
For example, the fate of
these journeying spirits

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:10%
could be that one person will
be an attorney, another person

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:10%
to be a writer, another person
a doctor, and another person

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:10%
maybe a truck driver,
different experiences.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
They could live a long
life, or they could

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:90%
pass when just a teenager.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.780 align:middle line:84%
They are all life agreements,
the contract laws,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.660 align:middle line:84%
which obviously, from
the human perspective,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
we don't always understand.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:84%
However, when you are
in that destination,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
on that map that was
previously drawn out,

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
free will clauses, when you
are in higher consciousness,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
it allows you to make small
changes, in that fate, that

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
has you driving a red car
on that highway of life,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.930 align:middle line:90%
which you can't avoid.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But that free will,
that awareness

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
can make you decide if
you go faster in that car

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.300 align:middle line:84%
or if you slow down,
if you want to stop

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
at the corner for a
moment or paint it green

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and travel more distance.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
That is, those
small changes only

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
happen, according to these
messages and information,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
if there is a greater
consciousness,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness is
relative and proportional

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to your usefulness
in that agreement,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
in your usefulness to the world
where you have incarnated,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
your usefulness, your
actions for your own life.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.670 align:middle line:84%
This contract law
and everything that

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:84%
happens in your transit on
planet Earth, in this case,

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not only subject
to your desire

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to live more in that blue
paradise that is the Earth.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But what else you can do in
your learning experience that

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
can also help those around
you, your family tribe or even

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:84%
beyond your family tribe,
which was expanded upon

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:84%
for your learning experience
but, rather, to overcome

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that circle and be a more useful
person for the peace process

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and balance of the planet
where you have decided to come?

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a really wonderful
subject, because so many of us

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
have grown up with the idea
that our purpose in life

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:84%
is to grow old, study for
a career, find a trade,

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
earn enough money to
survive, find a partner,

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
have children,
take care of them,

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.390 align:middle line:84%
grow old, accumulate
savings, have our own house,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and then depart.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And we think we were great human
beings because of our degrees,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.920 align:middle line:84%
because of the
house that we bought

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
for our wonderful children
and having given them the best

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
That's not enough.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:84%
In the spiritual world, you have
to be the same loving father

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.160 align:middle line:84%
or mother with people outside
of your family circle.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if we decide
to have children,

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
we have to be wonderful and
responsible people for them.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But can we feel the same
love and the same quality

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
to serve people
outside of our circle?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It's what is called the
redemption of humanity,

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
what is called working with
love for those around us,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:90%
for others.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And according to this
spiritual information,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic travelers who have
come to the school worlds

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
do not have to limit
themselves solely

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to those experiences of
their personal knowledge.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But they have to go further and
be useful to a higher purpose.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And discovering it is
the most important thing.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:10%
You will remember when we talked
about the Mayan prophecies

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.540 align:middle line:10%
and of the great calendars,
such as Tzolk'in calendar,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:10%
with 260 days, and
the Haab calendar,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:10%
the solar calendar
with 365 days.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
They spin and move together,
like gears on a great machine,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in order for them to coincide,
again, being different.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
52 solar years must go by, which
is called the calendar wheel.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And the guardians of
tradition of the Mayan world

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
say that when a person
turns 52 in his life,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
if you reach that age,
at that time at least,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:84%
you should already understand
what your life's purpose is

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:90%
and be carrying it out.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It is very interesting because
the same energies, according

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
to this information, that were
conspired during their birth

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:84%
are replicated again
in year number 52.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a myth or a symbol,
however you want to look at it.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's very
important to assess how

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:90%
we're going through our lives.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:90%
We are spirits.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.980 align:middle line:84%
We come from somewhere
in the multiverse.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And we are living an elusive
experience as humans,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:84%
with names given to
us by our parents,

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
with sexuality, with
mental characteristics,

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
with our social characteristics,
all that we are now,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
which will disappear
when we depart.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And we will return to being
that which came to Earth.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And we will have to
make an assessment.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:84%
While I was on this
planet, what did I learn?

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.120 align:middle line:90%
What did I do for others?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I think this reflection is very
focused on the famous papyrus

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of Hunefer, which is
over 3,000 years old.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
This Egyptian papyrus
shows Hunefer,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
a person who has just
passed, who finds himself

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
on the scales of life,
where his heart is

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
weighed with a feather.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, if Hunefer's life
was a righteous life, a life

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.860 align:middle line:84%
absent of sorrows,
his heart will not

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:90%
weigh more than a feather.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It will be light.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Then Thoth the Atlantean, the
mystical Hermes Trismegistus

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:10%
for some esoteric schools,
appearing with the head of ibis

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:10%
recording the information
in the book of life,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:10%
allowing him passage.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And Hunefer will meet
Osiris Orion, which we will

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:90%
address in the next episode.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And he will meet the guardians
of the universe, perhaps

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
the mythical council of Ma'at,
which suspiciously reminds me

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:84%
of the guardians of destiny
or the lords of karma.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.940 align:middle line:84%
That is, at some point, when we
leave planet Earth and return

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.600 align:middle line:84%
to our cosmic source,
our heart symbolically

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.250 align:middle line:90%
will be weighed with a feather.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
The great masters say
that the best preparation

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
for the highest initiation
a human being can have,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
which is death, is
to live righteously.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Neither our parents nor
the university or anything

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
has prepared us for that moment,
which can happen at any time.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It is a great initiation.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
There are human
beings who fear death

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.060 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know what comes after,

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.590 align:middle line:84%
others who fear the way they die
or the pain, others who may not

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:84%
fear death because they don't
know that it exists, as such,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that we pass on to
another reality.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Nor do they fear the pain,
but they do fear attachments,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that is, leaving things on
Earth that were not fully

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:90%
taken care of.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Are we ready for it?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I think the Hunefer papyrus
explains it very well.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:84%
A righteous life, the heart
lighter than a feather,

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
living righteously in
love and in service

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
is the best preparation
to return home.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:84%
As my friend Fabio
Zerpa said, now,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is it possible to experience
different planes, existences,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:84%
information that involve
our life in the multiverse,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
being anchored here on
Earth in this physical body?

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
The answer is yes,
but not a total yes,

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
because if we remembered
everything in detail, if we

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:84%
had access to great,
complete cosmic information,

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
our minds couldn't
fathom being confined

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:90%
to this human experience.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't be able to stand it.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.869 align:middle line:84%
And knowing all that
information could possibly

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
hinder our human
learning since there

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
has to be a bit of naivete,
if we can call it that,

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
to live the human experience
in a spontaneous way.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, when
a traveler enters

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
the paths of
consciousness, they could

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
access fragments of information
that reveal their way,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that they are paving the
path that they are traveling.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But accessing the total
memory is obviously

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
not part of the laws
of the universe,

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:90%
because it is not meant to be.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be living a
completely suitable learning

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:84%
What's more, we could be
living simultaneous existences

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And now human beings and
some projection of us,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.610 align:middle line:84%
some double, some
holography of us

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:84%
is being replicated
elsewhere in the universe.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But these beings say,
why try to understand it?

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The important thing
is that we are here.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And for now, we
have to understand

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.155 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of our life here
and make our life here fruitful.

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And is there a possibility
that at some point,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:21.940 align:middle line:84%
although we cannot comprehend
it, of course, intellectually,

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that all those existences,
realities, projections,

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and singularities
can come together,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.225 align:middle line:84%
at least for an
instant, within us?

00:18:31.225 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:90%
A great teacher taught this.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And we will talk about
it in the next episode--

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:90%
unconditional love.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Unconditional love is
what unites everything,

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.990 align:middle line:90%
what explains everything.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, all this information
from the journeying spirits

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:84%
who may arrive on planets
with a specific mission

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:84%
has been interpreted
in many ways,

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
especially in New Age groups.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And there is a very
important topic,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:84%
which is known as seeds
from the stars, that is,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
spirits from other
worlds or realities

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that may be born on Earth
as part of an aid mission.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Although in essence,
it is the same concept,

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it is
appropriate to analyze

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:90%
this matter in greater detail.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I will begin by saying
that, obviously, it

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult to
confirm if a human being has

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:90%
cosmic memories.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not referring to the
cosmic origin of their soul,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but to another interpretation,
which points out

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that some people are
extraterrestrials

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
who lived on other
planets and are now

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling a mission
infiltrated as human beings.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Although this is very
difficult to accept,

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:84%
according to our research
and personal experiences,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:90%
yes, it is possible.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
There are cases of
beings from other worlds

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that could be living as humans.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But they do so in silence
without attracting attention.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they
would be hindering

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
their anthropological mission
within our human society.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
All this has generated,
as I have already said,

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
different points of view and
also bizarre interpretations.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
One can find suggested
meditation techniques

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
on the internet
with certain steps

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that only take 12 minutes
for the individual

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to be activated as a star seed
and recall their cosmic origin.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I think this is an exaggeration,
besides the fact that it

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is very dangerous to encourage
these kinds of thoughts

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and ideas.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
In addition, as if
this were not enough,

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:84%
various channelers have
offered private sessions to,

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
in session, read the
person's internal information

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and tell them if they are a
being from Orion, Andromeda,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:90%
or Pleiades.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I have always said that beyond
the fact that there are people

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
capable of connecting to this
information who dwell on other

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:84%
planes and help other
people to interpret them,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
we cannot mix all cases, because
it is a very dangerous matter

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:20.410 align:middle line:84%
if we fall into suggestion
and conditioning.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is the reason
for my reflection.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
In all this, we may
also delve into what

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:84%
is called the indigo
movement, which

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
points to the emergence
of a group of children

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:84%
with a high level
of awareness as part

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:84%
of a great evolutionary leap
that humanity must take.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Undoubtedly, we are experiencing
important transformations

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that
children represent

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:90%
the hope for that change.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I know that there are
children with an awareness

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and perception who unequivocally
blaze the trail of hope.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a reality, but
we must also discern.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I think calling a child
indigo because they

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
don't want to study
and because they

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.350 align:middle line:84%
claim to remember
experiences from other lives,

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.430 align:middle line:84%
in exotic places merits
much more in-depth research,

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.630 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:84%
All the children
of this generation

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
are exceptionally
special because they

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:84%
have come at a historical
moment of the Earth.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
The term "indigo"
was coined in 1982

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
by American parapsychologist
Nancy Ann Tappe.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.500 align:middle line:84%
She used in her book
"Understanding Your Life

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Through Color," a very
interesting work, where

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
she assured that she had noticed
that many children had been

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
born with indigo-colored auras.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
This was toward the end
of the decade of the '70s.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Tappe later affirmed that 34%
of children under the age of 16

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:90%
were indigo.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:10%
However, other
studies on human aura,

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.300 align:middle line:10%
the energy field
surrounding living things,

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:10%
added that there were different
colors in the supposed

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:10%
cases of indigo children
who reflected these very

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:10%
particular qualities.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So to better
understand this enigma,

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:84%
others began to coin
other terms in addition

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to indigo, like crystal
children or cosmic children.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And, here, it was
also said that some

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of these little ones,
cosmic, crystals, or indigo,

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.320 align:middle line:84%
in this particular case,
were extraterrestrials

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.170 align:middle line:84%
or elevated spirits
from other worlds

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
who decided to live as humans.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But I reiterate it is
very difficult to confirm.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that much
more can be learned

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
about the mission of a being
with come from other realities

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:84%
by their humility
and their silence.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, I hear before
Tappe's book, there

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:10%
was an important
springboard that we

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.730 align:middle line:10%
must mention, a famous
book, "The Star People,"

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:10%
the work of the prolific
American writer Brad Steiger.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.380 align:middle line:84%
The renowned UFO
specialist was convinced

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that a percentage of
the human population

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
descended from
extraterrestrials,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
or that some humans could
directly be infiltrators.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Steiger had been tracking
all this for many years.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in 1976, he
had published the "Gods

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:10%
of Aquarius," a book inspired
by a spiritual belief

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:10%
of Native American Indians,
such as the Hopi, the Zuni,

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:10%
or the Dakota, which claims that
humans may have been created

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.770 align:middle line:10%
by visitors from the stars.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Steiger believed
that star people

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:84%
could be identified since
they are people with a very

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:90%
characteristic stamp.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
According to his research,
they would usually

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
be different humans who
feel isolated, alone,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and misunderstood, with the
feeling that they are not

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:84%
of this world, with a
feeling of nostalgia

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:01.870 align:middle line:84%
for the stars and difficulty
fitting into human society.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So based on these
observations, Steiger

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:84%
prepared a list of 30 questions
to identify them, incredible.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Among them, I could mention,
does your blood type

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:90%
have a negative factor?

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you have conjoined double
vertebra in your spine?

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you have some deviated ribs?

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you suffer from
chronic sinusitis?

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard whistling
or buzzing in your head?

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Have you always felt like
a stranger in this world?

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that your parents
are not your real ones,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
as if you had a family
member somewhere far away?

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Have you felt the need to look
for your origin in the stars?

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, this is a small sample.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:84%
The investigations of Brad
Steiger and Nancy Ann Tappe

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:84%
later inspired other
writers, such as Lee Carroll,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
indigo children.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I reiterate-- and I think
this reflection is important--

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:90%
all children are special.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Each being comes
with its own stem

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill a mission
of unique learning.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
information is very important

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:12.000 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we are all
here on Earth for a purpose.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the fact that there may
be extraterrestrial beings that

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
are living as humans, that
is, who were born on Earth,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:84%
have forgotten their origin
and may be fulfilling

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.110 align:middle line:84%
a silent mission,
beyond the fact

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
that some human
beings have become

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
aware of their
supposed previous lives

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in order to fulfill
some missions,

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and beyond the fact that some
children, without a doubt,

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
are excelling in this generation
due to their sensitivity

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to nature and the
creatures of the Earth,

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
we must not forget that
everyone, absolutely

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
everyone, who is here on Earth
is special, because we all

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
chose to come at this historic
time, in this special time

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.400 align:middle line:90%
to live life,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to be useful and live
with others in peace.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of whether we feel
different, aside from at times,

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we
do not feel part

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.840 align:middle line:84%
of this human system
in which we are living

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and of which we are part,
regardless of our sensations

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions, we are here.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:23.430 align:middle line:84%
We are spirits who live a
human learning experience.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And only when we finish
this process here on Earth,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
only when we get out of that
car on the highway of life

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:84%
that I described and back
to our true home will

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:40.540 align:middle line:84%
we reflect deeply on how it went
for us on our transit on Earth.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And on our next
trip, we will leave

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.210 align:middle line:84%
for Orion, the
mysteries of Egypt,

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and the great mission
of Jesus of Nazareth.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm Ricardo Gonzalez Corpancho.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're on board
"The Arc of Time."
