00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened 6,000
million years ago?

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
I am your host,
Matias De Stefano.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I
am going to explain

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:10%
that 6,000 million years
ago, matter was formed.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I am also going to
explain how matter

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.220 align:middle line:84%
was formed through the trinity
of creation, which includes

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
sound, light, and form.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:10%
In this planet that we live,
in the third dimension,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:10%
we are bounded by the trinity.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:84%
The trinity is a concept
that unites us all, and not

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:84%
only in concept, but also
in religion and science.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:84%
The trinity is the thing
that made us exist.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Trinity was born from
the second dimension.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
The second dimension
started to divide itself

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:84%
in order to create the
positive and the negative.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:90%
In the middle, the neutral--

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
it was that spot where the
whole energy of the universe

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
was going back, and from
which it was going out.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So these two vibrations
start to split and split

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and split, like a mythosis
in the cells, once and again

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:84%
in every direction,
going so far away

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that the concepts
of the unity start

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:84%
to split as long and
as far as it could,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
in the positive
and the negative.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, when it
got the most expanded,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
the force of the neutrality
started to push them back

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:90%
to the source of energy.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:90%
So it was kind of an echo.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
That echo that was created
from the duality started

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
to make waves around the
universe that we call time.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Time started to move like
waves in this big ocean.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And every movement had
a different vibration.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:10%
Those waves were
so low and so high,

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:10%
then started to move
so much that it started

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:10%
to create energy in
between polarities,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:10%
positive and negative, moving
this energy around and making

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:10%
it like a spiral.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And that spiral
started to create

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:90%
the energy for the first time.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Energy is what we call
light, and vibration

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:90%
what we call sound.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:10%
When they went together
to the very same spot,

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:10%
and all the energies and
sounds from the universe

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:10%
went to the core of
neutrality, the duality

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.510 align:middle line:10%
of positive and negative
create a new reality, what

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:10%
we call the matter or the form.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The form would be the shapes
of the universe, would

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
be the way in which the
consciousness will move,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
which was no more the expansion
and expression of the universe.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But now it begins
the experimentation.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Experimentation
would be the states

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
of the universe in which
the mind and the polarity

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.506 align:middle line:84%
can experience everything
that they were creating.

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Literally, time became space.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Literally, every perspective
starts to be experimental.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beginning
of the universe we know.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning
of the third dimension.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
In just one word, the
geometry was formed.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of geometry
in the universe

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.180 align:middle line:84%
is to help the consciousness
of the first dimension

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and the second dimension
to have a plan.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
That's the moment when
the cosmic plan was born.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
The cosmic plan
doesn't have a goal.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The only goal that it has is to
follow the lines of geometry,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to have an order,
to have a purpose,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to have a coherence on the
movement of the experience.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, from polarity, it
creates positive and negative.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And from that point we
create a third one that

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
would unite them all,
because when we are polarity

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:90%
we just have this perspective.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
So we need a third one.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
The third one allows us
to see those polarities

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.500 align:middle line:84%
from one only being, and
not being two of them.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So trinity starts
to be the third eye.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
We have two eyes,
positive and negative.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
have the third one,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:84%
which allows us
to see everything,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%
not only one perspective.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So the trinity of
the universe starts

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
as a way to understand
from where we go

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and how we have to do this
path around the universe.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:10%
So these three
patterns will allow

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.340 align:middle line:10%
us to know that we
have this point to go,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:10%
this other point where
we are heading to.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to
make the whole pattern

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
to get to the first one, with a
new interpretation of duality.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:10%
That is the moment where
the spirit creates the soul.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:90%
And the soul creates the body.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:10%
The body, the soul, and the
spirit is what we call a being.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And a being is the
three vibrations

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
that will help the consciousness
of the universe to understand

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
itself through experience.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The holy trinity that
we are talking about

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is not about a
god, a holy mother,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.850 align:middle line:84%
and a son that will guide us,
like Christianity would say.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
The holy trinity is
vibration, energy, and matter.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:90%
Matter is the body.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are not
three different things.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
They are the same thing
vibrating in different levels

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They are only one
reality, only one thing,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
but in different
ways of expression.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So trinity will be the
tool that the consciousness

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
of the universe has
to experience itself

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:84%
in different levels
of consciousness.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So 6,000 million years
ago, that vibration

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and that light in
the universe started

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
to go all to the same spot.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And from there, the patterns
of the universe started

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:10%
to split and create the network,
the network of reality--

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:10%
the matrix, the geometry.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:10%
We started to call
the spots like nodes.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:10%
The nodes are the spots where
all the energy concentrates

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:10%
in spiral.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we have these lines
that goes through one of them

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:90%
to the other one.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:90%
And we call that a mission.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to start from
one spot to go to another spot.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And we have a
mission to accomplish

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:90%
to get to that other spot.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:84%
When we accomplish
the whole pattern,

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:84%
we had accomplished
our purpose in life.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So the consciousness traced
a plan in which we all--

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
all the parts that were
split from the universe--

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
had to follow these
lines of geometry

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
so we don't lose
each other, so we

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
don't lose in the big
creation of the mind.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:10%
So matter will be the
focus of the universe,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:10%
where we can know that
we cannot do everything,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:10%
that we have to focus
on just one thing.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:10%
That's the purpose
of forgetting.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:10%
We are memory.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:10%
We are everything.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:10%
But in matter, we
must forget everything

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.250 align:middle line:10%
because it's the only
way you can concentrate

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:10%
in the spot you are heading to.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So matter will be
the patterns in which

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
we have to go through
to learn, step by step,

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
the different parts
of who we are.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:84%
The patterns that
we were creating

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and that started to
split in the universe

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
are our goals in the reality
to create more experiences

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.470 align:middle line:90%
in every step we give.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:90%
That, we call evolution.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Evolution is to try to
experience and get better

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
in that experience of learning
and teaching in every geometry

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:90%
we are going to.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the first stage, where
we create these three patterns.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And we activate the spirit.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is the first
thing that gets physical.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:84%
We used to believe that spirit
is something that is not here,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
that is in another level, and
that we are the physical part.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:10%
But we, the physical ones,
are just the last expression

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:10%
of the spirit.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.120 align:middle line:90%
We are not separate things.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.240 align:middle line:84%
We are the same thing, vibrating
different levels of matter.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
explodes in the universe

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is the spirit itself,
and we call the fire.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
That, also, we call
the tetrahedron.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron is the
matter that lights the spirit

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron, after
that, creates the cube.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The cube will be the
pattern that holds

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:90%
every dimension in matter.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Then we create the octahedron.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
After the octahedron, we
start to breathe to create

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.360 align:middle line:90%
the network of the icosahedron.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have also
the dodecahedron

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
after that, where we will
hold the creation itself

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that we call the matrix.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:10%
The matrix will be the 12
faces of the universe that

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:10%
are heading to the expression
of the whole reality.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So the first five
expressions of geometry

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:84%
hold the spirit, the
soul, and the body

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
in many different
levels of vibration.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:10%
The first one, as I
said, the tetrahedron,

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:10%
will allow us to feel
the fire, the spirit.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit is also
here as a tetrahedron.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
When you start to multiply
the tetrahedron as a fractal,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
once and again, once and
again, once and again,

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
you will hold the
spiral, where you

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:90%
will find the shape of the DNA.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA is the physical
expression of the spirit.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is not
something that is outside.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is something that
was created, that is physical,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and we call the DNA.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:10%
Every pattern that
was created in spiral

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:10%
through the shape
of the tetrahedron

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:10%
is the fire of the spirit,
and holds every information

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:10%
in the whole universe
since we started,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:10%
since 6,000 million years ago.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
That shape, our expression
in the universe,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:84%
allow us to realize
in the third dimension

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have the
spirit above our heads,

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.050 align:middle line:84%
that we have it
within in our blood,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and that we, our spirits,
live in this matter,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.393 align:middle line:90%
in this third dimension.

00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:31.685 align:middle line:84%
Third dimension is conditioned
by the second dimension,

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:90%
in between time and space.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:90%
Time and space are relative.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:90%
They are not something physical.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:90%
They are not something real.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Time and space are
just the perspective

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:84%
of the self trying to
focus in just one step

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:90%
to find one aspect of the being.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:90%
So we choose the time.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We choose the space in
which we want to be born,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.360 align:middle line:84%
where we want to
express ourself,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and which is the
tetrahedron that

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:90%
is most aligned to our purpose.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So we need this tetrahedron in
the positive and the negative,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and we would call, in the
third dimension, mom and dad.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we put
them all together,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
we create an
octahedron that will

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
allow us to divide our being
in many different levels

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, like the
mythosis of the soul that

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:90%
creates the chakras.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And the cube that holds every
dimension in ourselves we

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:10%
call now the cells.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:10%
Cells are cubes.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:10%
Split in many, many,
many thousands of them,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:10%
that creates a sphere.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:90%
A sphere is not a sphere itself.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
It's the conjunction
of every geometry that

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
was expressed in the universe to
create a perfect sphere, which

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.960 align:middle line:84%
would be the perfect shape to
leave every possible reality

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.670 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can see every
dimension is through a sphere.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why, in the universe,
the most evolving beings

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:middle line:84%
are spherical, like the cell
in the microcosmos and the sun

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:90%
or a planet in the macrocosmos.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
When you find the sphere, you
will realize that inside of it

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you have every pattern
possibly created.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can
go through this reality

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:84%
of the third
dimension, the only way

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you can go out this dimension,
is if you finished the patterns

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:90%
that you have created.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I used to explain, when I was
a kid, that when I was a spirit

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw this big supermarket where
we have all these geometries

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.730 align:middle line:90%
in different sections.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
choose every geometry

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that we call mom, purpose,
mission, our DNA, will.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You have different
things that you hold

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:90%
and you put in your bag.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
learn how to put them

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:84%
all together, that we
call the moment of birth.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The moment of birth is when you
put all these geometries around

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.580 align:middle line:90%
that we call the shards.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.650 align:middle line:84%
You have astral shards that
press with gravity, press time

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and space to mold yourself
into all these geometries you

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:90%
have picked in the universe.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can experience one
thing, or three or four things.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you are born,
you have to experience

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
all of every line and spot
that creates that geometry.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't finished with
the whole purpose of matter,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to see every dimension
of this geometry,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
you have to go
back and try again.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:90%
So that, we call karma.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Karma is not
something that is bad.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
We used to call
karma like something

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
that you've done bad things and
you are repeating the course.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:90%
But really, it means learn.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Karma is all these things
that you haven't learned yet.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you have learned
it, it becomes dharma.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
understand the whole reality

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and heal this
karma-dharma wheel is

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
if you experience every spot
and line in these geometries,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
through your lives in
different times and spaces.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
third dimension

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
will be the place where you
have to practice the coherence.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Coherence is the most difficult
and the most important thing

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:10%
that you could ever
have in the universe

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.620 align:middle line:10%
of the third dimension,
because coherence

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:10%
is to be a line in between
the heritage of the spirit,

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:10%
the heritage of the soul,
and the heritage of the body.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:10%
If you want to
call it vibration--

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.970 align:middle line:10%
the spirit, the energy, which
is the soul and emotions,

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:10%
and the matter the DNA,
which is our history

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:10%
in the third dimension.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
So they are like
grandfather, father, and son.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are like
a tree of life.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate beings.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:84%
They are all connected
through the same vibration,

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
which is the spirit.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the third
dimension, you have

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
to experience every
possibility of those three.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And you have to align the
three realities in just one.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
That's why the third dimension
is the most difficult

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:84%
dimension, because you have
to put every geometry you have

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
created since the very
beginning of the universe

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:90%
in just one being.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have too many
emotions, too many experiences,

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
pain, suffering and all
these realities that

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
are not built from another
being in another part

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But they were created by
you, by yourself, who created

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:90%
this reality to understand.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you're not
able to understand

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:84%
why you have created, you
start to have headache.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And you're stuck in the process.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And when the geometry
is stuck, the chakras

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.360 align:middle line:84%
are not able to
roll, to go through.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And that stuck the chakras.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes an illness--

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:90%
sick.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:47.290 align:middle line:84%
So every process that we
think is something bad

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:84%
that is happening
to us, it's not

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
because someone is
sending that to us.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It's because we are stuck in
the process of not understanding

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:90%
why we choose this experience.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So the third
dimension is the one

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
where you have
come to understand

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
who you are through
experience, just experience.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you have to
experience as many things

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
as you possibly can
in the third dimension

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and to live as many lives
you can possibly live.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
This is not a dimension where
you have to escape from.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Third dimension is
the one that allows

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the other dimensions
to experience

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.780 align:middle line:90%
what they have created.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was in
another dimension, I

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.350 align:middle line:84%
used to remember that for many
of us, when we were called

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to be born in the third
dimension for the first time,

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:90%
we felt it was an honor.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
We didn't feel like, oh, it's
terrible we are going there.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
What I felt was, I am
glad that someone--

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
myself-- picked myself
to go and live the things

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:90%
that I have think about it.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
It's like living
your own dreams.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the most
important dream

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.807 align:middle line:84%
you could ever have created,
the third dimension.

00:20:11.807 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, when we
are just spiritual beings,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.250 align:middle line:90%
we are just one light.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And we are expressed in
one level of vibration.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
People used to call this
the different rays of light,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
like violet ray or
the blue one, pink--

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
different rays of light
from where we come from.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
That means the different
level of vibration

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
in which your spirit
is vibrating, so

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:90%
from where it was created.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:10%
But when the
spiritual being starts

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:10%
to go out the first dimension to
split in the second dimension,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:10%
you will have now
a big opportunity

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.770 align:middle line:10%
to fill every color
of every light,

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:05.710 align:middle line:10%
because when it split you have
the most lower vibration, which

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.450 align:middle line:10%
is the negative,
and the most higher

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:10%
vibration, which
is the positive.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So in between of them
is not just one light.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
It's many of those
lights, that goes

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.150 align:middle line:84%
from the very dark red
to the very high violet,

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:90%
crossing all the rainbow.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So that, we call the different
energies of the universe.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:10%
But they were just one split
into positive and negative.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And that creates a lot of them.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
vibration they have,

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:84%
they will express and
experience an echo of frequency.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Low frequency, which
would be like a very low

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
vibration, and even more
higher and higher and higher

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:90%
vibration and frequencies.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So these vibrations creates
different perspective

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.190 align:middle line:90%
in which you can see the truth.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:90%
We call that emotions.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.803 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are the different
ways you can see the truth.

00:22:10.803 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:10%
That's why in the
third dimension,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:10%
emotions are so important.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are really
important, not only for humans

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
but for every being existing,
because every being existing

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:29.600 align:middle line:84%
has chakras and have this energy
engine that makes them work.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So we had put those
emotions, cultural beliefs--

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that's why we think that
humans are the only ones that

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%
have emotions.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:90%
But the planet has emotions.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:90%
The stones has emotions.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Every being has emotions
in the third dimension,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
because we are all
bounded by energy.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So the different
vibrations of energy

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:90%
creates these different chakras.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And these different chakras
has different patterns

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The first ones were the
fire, the energy of fire,

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
that some people
call the Kundalini.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
That's why the tetrahedron,
the seed of that energy,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:90%
is in the first chakra.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to
go to the cube, which

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
is the second chakra, then
the third chakra and so on.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:10%
So we have these
different patterns

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:10%
of energy creating
the shape of the body.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So every part and every
geometry, what it will do

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
is to divide itself as
many times and many spaces

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:90%
as possible to create the body.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So every geometry, multiplied
for many, many thousands

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of times, it will
shape the organs

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that will help us to
create our bodies.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So the energy moving within
and outside all the time,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:90%
like a wheel--

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Chakra means wheel in Sanskrit.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:10%
So those wheels are
creating so, so many energy,

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.350 align:middle line:10%
like a torus which is
spinning around itself,

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:10%
that its brightness starts to
create different lightnings

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:10%
and lights around
that shape the matter.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So the matter is a
consequence of that vibration.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So every organ you have is
the product of that vibration.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, also,
when you go to nature,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.520 align:middle line:84%
you will see that some
fruits and some vegetables

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and some animals has the shapes
of the organs of your body.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they are also
a product of that vibration.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
you have an illness,

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
you have to see which
organ is the one that needs

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.850 align:middle line:90%
more energy with that shape.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And you will find that
some seeds and some fruits

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and some vegetables
has the shape

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:90%
and the colors of those organs.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So when they start,
you can go outside

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and look for that energy, and
eat it to have that frequency

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
and energy to heal the chakras.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Also, emotions heal the chakras,
because the other people

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:90%
is a resonance of you.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you try to align your
chakras, maybe some people,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
just with some words or some
feelings or some sharing,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
are just aligning your chakras
with the same vibration

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:90%
and the same patterns.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.740 align:middle line:84%
When you try to understand
how the matter works

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and how reality works
in the third dimension,

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
the most accurate
statement you could have

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.860 align:middle line:90%
is, for us, technology.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I used to call that the
body is like a computer.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:90%
The body is the hard drive.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the soul
is the software,

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
which is the program that
goes into the computer.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
And then you have Wi-Fi--

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
internet-- which
we call the spirit.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:07.925 align:middle line:84%
So now, entering in the new
time to understand matter

00:26:07.925 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:84%
and the reality of
the third dimension,

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
that we work

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
as a product of the
internet, creating a software

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:90%
to develop a computer.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So we should change our way
of thinking about reality,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
not as something separate in the
third dimension, like something

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:90%
holy and something material.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But all of that is just a
consequence from each other.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why coherence is the most
important thing in the matter,

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
because coherence is when
you have aligned the three

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:90%
aspects of yourself within you.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
find your own truth

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and your own
perspective of reality.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano,

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:84%
for this series on the
creation of the universe.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:10%
we will dive into the
four pillars of reality

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:10%
and how that affects you.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:16.075 align:middle line:90%
