00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What was life like
in Atlantean colonies?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.050 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
will explore life

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:84%
in Khem, which encompasses what
we know today as ancient Egypt.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:10%
When Atlantean
civilizations started

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:10%
to split all around
the world, they

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:10%
knew that in order to open the
portals through time and space,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:10%
they needed to be
balanced and aligned

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:10%
with all information
of the world within.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
We weren't able to open
the doors of time and space

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
in the planet until we got
really aligned with our purpose

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
on Earth as humans.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was creating
these colonies

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
in these special spots in the
world where they could reach

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:90%
this awareness of the self.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:10%
When Atlantis was
in the main islands,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:10%
they started to create this
path to acknowledge themselves

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:10%
through the Mediterranean
Sea, and they were also

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:10%
creating a path in Europe
and the Middle East

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:10%
that the most important
one was that one that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:10%
held the energy of
three continents and one

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:10%
important plateau.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The delivery of energy from
Africa, Europe, Middle East,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and Asia are pushing that
energy of the planetary grid

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
with all these forces
towards the Sinai Peninsula.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
That means that the region of
Israel and the Sinai Peninsula

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
are the places where the balance
of the energy of the heart,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the plexus, and the root chakra,
and sacrum chakra of the planet

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:90%
are connected.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So the strength to creation
is empowered in that region.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Atlanteans-- they recognized
that if we are willing

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to create realities, we needed
to create that strength--

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:90%
that force from the Earth--

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
That is why the river
Nile was chosen to create

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:90%
the path towards enlightenment.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Atlanteans recognized that that
region in Middle East and North

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Africa was the most important
region from where they could

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
take all the
information, and they

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:84%
remembered that the
Aessir who created them

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
chose that region
because of that reason.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The energy flowing between
the sea of life in Galilea

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and the sea of death in
the Jordan River and all

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the information from the deserts
around and the river Nile

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
were so important for
Atlanteans to reconnect

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
with the importance
of creation that they

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
said if we get this alignment
to become gods and goddesses

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.490 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, we will be
able to open the portals

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and handle time
here on this planet.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
That is why the ancient priests
and priestesses from Atlantis

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
decided to build this
country that we named Khem.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Khem was the builders of
the portals of the truth.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
We were the beings searching
for the enlightenment in order

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.430 align:middle line:90%
to create our own realities.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.960 align:middle line:84%
For us, that's the main reason
why Khem was so important,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and our daily life was
to try to reach balance

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and to reach knowledge to
awaken the power of the soul,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
the body, and the spirit.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:10%
The goal of Khem was to make
Atlantean gods and goddesses

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:10%
Gain-Ebedis means
lands of great wealth,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:10%
where a lot of minerals-- a
lot of food-- can be taken--

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:10%
all the resources in order to
create the portals in order

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:10%
to create the temples--

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:10%
was so important because
of the flow of something

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.280 align:middle line:10%
that we call Tulfah,
The Great Flow.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:10%
The Great Flow-- Tulfah--

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:10%
it was the River Nile.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:10%
And it was important from
the beginning to the end.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:10%
The beginning of the River
Nile, the Tulfah, was Nan-ah.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:10%
Nan-ah was the lake that now we
call Victoria Lake in Uganda.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:10%
And this was called the
Mirror From Heavens.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So Nan-ah was the
window to the beyond.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And from there, all the
energy from the stars

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:10%
came to this big lake, and from
there all the water started

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.350 align:middle line:10%
to flow through the Blue Nile
and go through Uganda, Sudan,

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:10%
and Egypt, and into
the Mediterranean Sea.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
All this flow-- the
Great Flow of energy--

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:90%
was the shape of a body.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Imagine having the feet of
a person in South Sudan,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
legs over the territory

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
until you find the
spine in North Sudan,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.400 align:middle line:84%
and the whole spine in
Egypt until the skull

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have every
chakra along the River Nile.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And because of that
energy, we decided

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to build the temples to create
the path towards enlightenment

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that would help us to reconnect
with the portals of the planet.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Many people know and understand
that the human body has seven

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
chakras, but there are two
chakras regions that are not

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:90%
spoken about very much--

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
the ones of the
knees and the ankles.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
A chakra is basically
a wheel of energy.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the energy that begins
to manifest by the vibration

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and movement of the geometrical
patterns that forms us.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
A chakra is like an engine
that allows the energy to spin

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and manifest realities,
pulsing the flow of vitality

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and information
between all dimensions.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
The structure of
a chakra is based

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
on the patterns created by the
main platonic solids generated

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:90%
by the resonance of the vacuum.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, we have
chakras everywhere--

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:90%
in atoms, cells, organs.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
All of them feed one
another with energy,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
creating a network.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And in our body, the
main ones are seven--

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.530 align:middle line:84%
crown, third eye, throat,
heart, plexus, sacrum, and root,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
with other two extended
from the root chakra

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:90%
in the knees and ankles.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
The knees chakra,
with color burgundy,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
is related to the mission and
the patterns-- so all the path

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that created the network of
collective memories in history.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
The chakra of the ankles is
magenta, related to the purpose

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%
and destiny and freedom--

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:84%
also, the matrix and
all the connections

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:90%
that we make in our existence.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the body
in this perspective

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand that
we are a network of energy,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:90%
sharing information constantly.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And in taking these other two
lower chakras, we not only work

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
with our own self, but
the self with which we are

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:90%
connected to related to others.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:84%
This is how the Atlanteans
viewed the body--

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
related to the image of a
cube with nine dimensions

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:90%
from where all realities emerge.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The region of Gain-ebedis was
from North Libya to Egypt,

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
the Cyprus Island, Lebanon,
Israel, part of Jordan,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:84%
part of Arabia, South
Sudan, Uganda, and Ethiopia,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
and Eritrea.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:84%
These countries were the regions
where the Atlanteans settled--

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the country that
would not only give

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
resources for the civilization,
but also resources

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:90%
for the being--

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:90%
for the spirit and the soul.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
The main priests and
priestesses from Atlantis

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
went through all
the river from North

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
to South to find the energy
of this huge flow of life

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:90%
that we call now the River Nile.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And they figured out that
the connection to Earth

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:84%
was the highest point in
what we call now Ethiopia.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The region of Ethiopia was
called the core of Earth.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And from the core of
Earth, all the minerals

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
were taken to build
the being, which

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:90%
would be along the River Nile.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
We call that region Thi
Gangha, and Thi Gangha

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
was the big land
of enlightenment

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:90%
from the core of the Earth.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Thi Gangha and Eliapolimbi
were the two regions

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:90%
in the South of this country--

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Khem-- that gave us the
strength from Earth--

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
from the roots of Earth,
giving us the food and animals

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
and also the minerals.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
These minerals were brought from
the South in Ethiopia and Sudan

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
to North into the regions
of Ruhnubah and Ruhnilazoh.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And they were put in the
North to build all the chakras

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:10%
along the River Nile.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:84%
The process of the country
was to create the biggest

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:90%
human in the planet.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
The biggest human
would be the body

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
of every civilization imprinted
there in North Africa.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Every human would have to
go through the River Nile

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:84%
to enlight itself in
this Initiatic Path

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:84%
towards enlightenment--
towards themselves.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And once they achieved the
correct vibration in the body,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
in the soul, and
the spirit, they

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
would be able to get
inside the pyramids.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And once they are
inside the pyramids,

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
they were able to open the
portals of Orion here on Earth.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is why after
the first big pyramid,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
they created the other
ones that were aligned

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
with Orion's portal so we could
open the doors through time

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Every being in history that
was looking for enlightenment

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
had to go through this path
that started in North Sudan

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:90%
and finished in Cyprus.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.340 align:middle line:84%
The goal of Cyprus was
to touch the spirit.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
The spirit with that island
where the ancient temples

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that were there were
to connect the people

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
with their own spirit
and to bring them

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.570 align:middle line:84%
to life through the region
of Lebanon and Israel.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So all this cycle
of North Egypt,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Cyprus, Lebanon, and
Israel were the cycle

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that every being
has to hold in order

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to get to the brain and the
matrix of the universe--

00:11:55.390 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
this region, meant to be
the head of the biggest

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:90%
human in history in geography.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
The portal of Israel
with the City of Peace--

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
YerÃº Shaleim-- was the region
that would balance the soul

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:90%
in between life and death.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The region of Lebanon
would be the door

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:84%
of the spirit towards the soul,
which would be in South Israel.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Sinai Peninsula
would be the portal

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.300 align:middle line:84%
from where the spirit and the
soul would enter the body.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The northern region
of Egypt would

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
be the connection of the pineal
gland and the hypophysis gland,

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and would attach the spiritual
world with the physical world.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it
was the region--

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
the Giza region--
where everyone would

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:90%
go to live like gods on Earth.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Geographically, the
energy of that region

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
allowed Atlantean
people to be in touch

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.710 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of the planet
and the energy of the stars.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
In order to recognize
how Atlanteans

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
used to build
cities and towns, it

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:84%
was not like a futuristic way
of seeing the civilization.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:84%
They used to build the cities
with big stones, because as big

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
as they are, and as
long as they are,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.380 align:middle line:84%
they would hold the
information and the vibration.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they built these
cities in the shape of circles,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
but their temples
used to be built

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:90%
like squares or like cubes.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they do
that is because they

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
were trying to emulate the
structure of the universe.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
create the chambers

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
so you could be in the center
of the eight dimensions

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:90%
and become the ninth dimension.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So the structures of the
buildings in Atlantean times

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.330 align:middle line:84%
where big stones, and
the way you can read

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
can recognize the
architecture of that time

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:84%
is not only because
they are very big,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.150 align:middle line:84%
but also because
looking to the corners.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:90%
If you see in Peru, in Egypt--

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:90%
in other regions of the planet--

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
they have the same
structure of construction

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
in which big stones
are connected

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
by a very soft
corner that was not

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:84%
only to prevent
earthquakes, but it was also

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
to move the flow of energy
around the building.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the temple
in front of the Sphinx,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the most ancient
temples from Atlantean times

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:90%
that you can see and touch.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And also when you
go to Osirion, which

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
is behind the temple
of Abydos, that's

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.500 align:middle line:84%
the other temple
from Atlantean times

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that you can see, that you
can feel-- that you can touch.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.720 align:middle line:84%
These temples are the only
temples that you can still

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
see from the Atlantean
times, and some of them

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:84%
are also in Peru, in Bolivia,
and in Mexico, in Colombia.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Some ancient structures
in the Mediterranean Sea

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East--

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
all of them are
built by Atlanteans.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
The temples that
they were building

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.340 align:middle line:84%
at that time, each one of
them were for each chakra.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The first one was the
root chakra in Sudan,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and then the second
chakra in South Egypt.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can follow the
temples through the spine,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
because the shape of
the Nile is exactly

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:84%
the shape of the
spine of a person.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the shape
of the River Nile,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you will find the places where
you can attach every organ.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So at the same lines
of these organs,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:02.990 align:middle line:84%
you will find the temples where
the ancient Atlanteans used

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:90%
to settle their constructions.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are hidden
in the underground,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and they were
covered by the desert

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:90%
and by the mud of the river.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
The river used to be more
wide, more open, more big,

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:90%
and with much more water.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was more ice
in the highest mountains,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.850 align:middle line:84%
because there was
a glaciation, so it

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:90%
was more cold at that time.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And the desert was
smaller, so savanna would

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
reach until the North of Egypt.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And some animals,
like elephants,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
would live in that region,
which now they can't

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
live because of the desert.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:84%
All the temples were
lost, because they

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
were covered by the
time, the geography,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:90%
and the change of weather.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
When the Age of Leo ended
about 12,000 years ago,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:90%
the era of Cancer began.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
And the era of Cancer
brought the big flood

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
that covered many regions in
the planet with big rains,

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
and also the end
of the glaciation.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
All the civilization
went away from the seas

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:90%
and went to live to the rivers.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
In this period of time, the wars
between the different families

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in the regions of Khem
ended with a process

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment, and it divided
the country in many regions.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
This division brought
a lot of conflicts

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
in between our
people, and it was

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.690 align:middle line:84%
the end of the process
of consciousness

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
during the period of
the Atlantean colonies.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Living there at
first was very easy,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.500 align:middle line:84%
because everything
was ruled by women.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything was ruled by
circles, and the civilization

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
was treated like
sons and daughters

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:84%
until Gemini time came,
like around 6,000 BC.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
This period of time in
history made a division

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
in between North and South
regions of the consciousness,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and they were
against each other.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So they were making
what would become

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Egypt in the next period.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The loss of consciousness
and the polytheism

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
that started to
create a new idea

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
of the temples of the holy
places in the River Nile.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:84%
As the desert started to
grow and the only food--

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.520 align:middle line:84%
the only things that they would
have was just in the river--

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.820 align:middle line:84%
they would start to fight
for the power of who

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:90%
controls the river.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
That brought the idea of
a pyramidal structure.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So they created the
military, and they

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
started to create the
idea of a new country

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:20.180 align:middle line:84%
in the era of Taurus, 5,000
years ago where Egypt began.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They tried to emulate
what Atlanteans

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:90%
did 12,000 years ago.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
They rebuilt the temples
with new architecture.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.060 align:middle line:84%
In Atlantean times, they didn't
have round-shape columns.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have the
structure of an Egyptian

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:90%
or a Roman or Greek structure.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Our temples were square
with square columns,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and that's the main difference
between ancient Egypt

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantean Egypt.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.470 align:middle line:84%
When they started to
build the new temples,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
they used the structure
of Mediterranean cultures.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you can find
these big temples that

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
were built 3,000 years ago
in Egypt that were financed

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:90%
by Greeks and Roman people.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Those temples tried to emulate
what the Initiatic Path was

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:90%
and to understand how it worked.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It was beginning in what we
now call Abu Simbel, which

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:90%
it didn't exist before.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:10%
The first temples
that we can relate now

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:10%
to the first Initiatic Path
was in Abu Simbel in Philae

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:10%
and in Kom Ombo.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:10%
These three temples were
meant to work in relation

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:10%
with the body.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So they would prepare the
Initiatic people to know

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:90%
how to handle the body--

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
how to understand the
importance of the body

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
through the three
chakras that represented

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.090 align:middle line:84%
the root, the sacrum
chakra, and the feet.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
The feet would connect us
with the root of the planet,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and then the other
with sexuality,

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and the other one
with the creation.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
These three first
chakras would teach us

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
how to go through a process of
healing our history, our DNA,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and healing our
emotions in the way

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that we can create
with neutrality and not

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:90%
through the darkness emotions.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
We learned in those
temples how to handle

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
the most deep and
strong emotions in a way

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
that we could understand
they were energy.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It was not how to
control those emotions,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
but learn how to use
the energy of the body

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring that
energy to enlighten

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:90%
the mind and the heart.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
In the first temples, we had
to face fear, frustration,

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and hunger, and all the emotions
that were the worst that we

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.710 align:middle line:90%
could ever have.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But we needed to learn
how to handle them,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:90%
not to get rid of them.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:84%
We had to prepare our
bodies to be the machines

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
to hold that information
and to prepare the soul

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to be this engine to
create all the energy

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:90%
for the spiritual mind.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in the next
temples like Edfu, Luxor,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Karnak, and Abydos
Dendera those temples

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
where the ones preparing the
plexus chakra and the heart

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
In that region, we were
preparing our soul to be

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
related to everything--
to become everything,

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to channel the
information from the plants,

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
from the minerals, from
plants, animals, other people,

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:90%
civilizations, families--

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
so to recognize who we
are, where we come from,

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
and how we can
transcend everything

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:90%
that we think we are.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we needed to
learn about love, so the love

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:84%
in the way of sexuality, the
love in the way of creation

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and how to become the mother
of the network of the matrix.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
of creating life

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
through the soul, the
memory, the water--

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:90%
the feminine aspect of reality.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
In those temples, we were
prepared in the soul.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:90%
The first ones were the body.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.760 align:middle line:90%
The middle ones where the soul.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And then the third chakra--

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
the third eye chakra
and the crown chakra--

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.000 align:middle line:84%
were the pyramids that
we had to go and prepare

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of our body to
be imbalance of vibration,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:90%
of chantings.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So we had to be prepared on how
to speak, which words to use,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and how to enlight our vibration
to get enlightened in colors,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in soul, and to achieve
the spiritual mind

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:31.010 align:middle line:84%
through the last temples
in the mind, which

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:90%
would be the pyramids.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
After you had lived in every
temple and all the tests--

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:84%
like 33 tests that
you had to go through

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
in these temples
with these masters--

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
with these priests
and priestesses--

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.180 align:middle line:84%
you were sent to the desert
in the Sinai Peninsula

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.100 align:middle line:84%
alone without food, without
water, without anything--

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
just yourself, to
prove yourself that you

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:84%
were really able to achieve
your goals through illumination.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the hardest
part of the preparation,

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:84%
because you thought that
the Great Pyramid would

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.170 align:middle line:84%
be the last part
of the preparation,

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:84%
but the real path
of preparation was

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:28.280 align:middle line:84%
when you were sent to
find the lands of God.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And the lands of God was to go
through the desert of Sinai,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:90%
and then die in the Dead Sea.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You had to face death, and then
go through the stream of life

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to be reborn again
in the Galilean Sea.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you would find
the temples of time in Lebanon.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And from there, you
would have to go and face

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:10%
the eyes of the snake in Turkey.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.480 align:middle line:84%
When you did that,
you would go again

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:84%
to Cyprus, where
nobody was there--

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:90%
only the spirit.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
And then you'd get enlightened.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you could take a
boat again to the River Nile

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and find yourself bringing
the spirit to the body.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:10%
The ceremony to become
a real Arsayian, which

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:10%
would talk to the world,
was to cross by yourself

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:10%
the Habbadabtra.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:10%
Habbadabtra was the mirror
to the beyond after death,

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:10%
and it was the lake that
now we call Qarun in Egypt.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:84%
You were meant to go by night
and just lie in the water

00:26:53.390 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and breathe deep and float
in the water in the darkness.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:84%
What would happen there
is that all the stars were

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:09.410 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the water, so you
would be sailing with the gods.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
You would be part of the gods,
but knowing that that water

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:90%
was filled with crocodiles.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:84%
If you were able to
reach the balance,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the darkness
were in the water

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and the stars were
also in the darkness,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and you would sail
with your own body,

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.020 align:middle line:84%
nude through the
water of Habbadabtra.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
It was because you were ready to
be part of the divine on Earth.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
For us today, it's important
to recognize the power of Egypt

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and all the River Nile--

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Khem-- because from
the very beginning

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that region was the one that
prepared every human working

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:84%
for the consciousness
of the planet

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of the
divine on Earth.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So along all the
history, every master

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:08.180 align:middle line:84%
had to go through that river
to find the power of the self--

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:84%
to find the power
of the portals,

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and to open the portals
within to become

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.250 align:middle line:90%
the key of heavens on Earth.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.520 align:middle line:90%
So every culture, every master--

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
every being that is remembering
the importance of Egypt

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
in the past and the
present are the ones

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that recognize that are the
keys to open those doors.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
for us to recognize

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
the power of this river,
because it was not only

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:90%
that time that was important.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It is still today, even if
you cannot go and do the whole

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
process like we
did in that time.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You can still visit
those temples,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and the information is
still alive in the stones.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:90%
So you can go and feel it.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Just breathing the
information there,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:84%
you can do the same path
that every human had

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:84%
done in Atlantean
times and awake

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:90%
that information in yourselves.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:18.680 align:middle line:10%
As many people go and walk
this path to illumination--

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:10%
walk this path of initiation--

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:10%
then you will become part
of those keys opening

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:10%
the heavens on Earth-- the plan
that we call the Ater Tumti.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and guide,
Mattias De Stefano.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:84%
the concepts imprinted on the
Egyptian gods and goddesses.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:90%
