00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Most spiritual teachings
speak of going within,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.951 align:middle line:84%
within holistic codes and the
signs of the sixth dimension.

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.953 align:middle line:84%
This is the dimension
of the architects

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:42.209 align:middle line:84%
from which the third
dimension is projected.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth dimension,
there is no matter,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:90%
no physical realities.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.468 align:middle line:84%
There are only geometric
models that designs

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:56.556 align:middle line:90%
the patterns of the cosmos.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.559 align:middle line:84%
What we experience here
in the third dimension

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.561 align:middle line:84%
begins with the
holographic designs

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.149 align:middle line:90%
from the sixth dimension.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.151 align:middle line:84%
And locking this
dimension within,

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:12.072 align:middle line:84%
we are able to create
our own reality.

Why is it important for spirits
to transform ether into matter?

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.556 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
In this episode,
we will describe

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.352 align:middle line:84%
the process in which the
spiritual mind creates

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:47.149 align:middle line:90%
the physical worlds.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.651 align:middle line:84%
One of the main questions
that we all have

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.404 align:middle line:84%
is where do we
come from, and how

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.448 align:middle line:90%
all this reality was created?

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:58.493 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, all the
reality that exists,

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.831 align:middle line:84%
it just exists because
we hold it in our minds

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:06.126 align:middle line:84%
and not because
it really exists.

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:11.173 align:middle line:84%
All that we can
touch, feel, smell

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:16.595 align:middle line:84%
is everything that we had
created in different realities

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.264 align:middle line:84%
so we could experience
what we are,

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:22.768 align:middle line:84%
what we already know
about ourselves.

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:27.314 align:middle line:84%
And the main idea of
creating the realities

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:32.152 align:middle line:84%
that we know today, it was to
have the environments in which

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:36.781 align:middle line:84%
we could be seen,
where we could relate

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.284 align:middle line:84%
our shapes, our
ideas of ourselves,

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.621 align:middle line:84%
and we can touch it
and experience it.

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:47.834 align:middle line:84%
So that is why the spiritual
mind of the universe

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:52.005 align:middle line:84%
needed to create the path
so we could understand

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.885 align:middle line:84%
the ways in which we could
express experience, integrate,

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:03.392 align:middle line:84%
and transcend ourselves through
the different dimensions.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:84%
That is why the spirits in the
first stage of the universe

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.899 align:middle line:84%
needed to create as
many ideas as possible

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.487 align:middle line:84%
so we could see each other
in different reflections.

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:20.409 align:middle line:84%
The way we created this,
it was through the mind.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.453 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the mind of
the universe is like a sun.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.873 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the light,
everything is there,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.584 align:middle line:84%
everything comes from
the suns that were

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%
exploded at the first time.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.758 align:middle line:84%
And then by gravity, it all
comes back to the same spot.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:39.158 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the mind
of the universe being

00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:84%
exactly the like a sun with
a lot of rays of light going

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.395 align:middle line:84%
into different directions,
into every direction

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:52.149 align:middle line:84%
without blocking any
part of the system.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.445 align:middle line:84%
So it could give light to
North, South, East, West,

00:03:56.445 --> 00:04:00.657 align:middle line:84%
to any part of the places
where you can see the sun.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:05.245 align:middle line:84%
And that is related with
different perceptions

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.956 align:middle line:90%
of the mind and the universe.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Every ray of light
coming from the sun

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.754 align:middle line:84%
is seen in different planets,
in different systems,

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.255 align:middle line:90%
from different stars.

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:20.385 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that every
one of those rays

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:25.682 align:middle line:84%
are a spirit, the spirits are
just the rays of light coming

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.852 align:middle line:90%
from the sun, from one self.

00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And this explains how every
spiritual being in the universe

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.571 align:middle line:84%
are just only one being looking
into different directions.

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.781 align:middle line:84%
When we see that,
when we understand

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.703 align:middle line:84%
that the light coming from the
consciousness of the spirit

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
is just the mind trying
to reach every limitation,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.293 align:middle line:84%
every farthest spot
in the universe,

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.755 align:middle line:84%
it's this mind trying
to reach everything

00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:01.801 align:middle line:84%
that it could possibly
imagine in the whole reality.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.513 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call
the Ivssa Eubath,

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:09.684 align:middle line:84%
and it was the field where the
universe creates mind, ideas,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle line:90%
thoughts, dreams.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:18.151 align:middle line:84%
This energy was a positive
and negative energy

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.112 align:middle line:84%
flowing around moving
the energy of light

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:22.989 align:middle line:90%
through all the universe.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.618 align:middle line:84%
And these created the
different perspectives

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.287 align:middle line:84%
in which the creators,
the minds that

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.623 align:middle line:84%
were dreaming in
the universe, could

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.084 align:middle line:84%
see the possibilities
of everything

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:90%
that they could possibly do.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
stage, the spirits

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.344 align:middle line:84%
were just looking into the space
like if it was a movie where

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:49.349 align:middle line:84%
they could see every timeline of
everything that could possibly

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.686 align:middle line:84%
be created and they could
see the past, the present,

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:56.147 align:middle line:90%
and the future of all of it.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:06:00.652 align:middle line:84%
This is related with
Plato in Greece used

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.863 align:middle line:90%
to call the world of ideas.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:10.036 align:middle line:84%
This mind of the universe that
was creating all the shapes

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and mixing all the shapes
to create new ones,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.793 align:middle line:84%
all this was just an
illusion, a projection

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:20.589 align:middle line:84%
from the sun creating
different levels of vibration

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.425 align:middle line:84%
through the heat or
the cold according

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to where the rays of lights
were moving through the space.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.101 align:middle line:84%
This energy and vibration
is what we call ether.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:39.941 align:middle line:84%
Ether was just sound,
ideas, mind lights vibrating

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.402 align:middle line:90%
through the spiritual world.

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:45.113 align:middle line:84%
From ancient times,
ether means heaven,

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:49.534 align:middle line:84%
means those things that are
out there and you cannot touch,

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:52.996 align:middle line:84%
those things that are
related with the blue sky.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:54.164 align:middle line:90%
That's the ether.

00:06:54.164 --> 00:07:00.003 align:middle line:84%
The space of light, the space
that you cannot see but you

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:07.927 align:middle line:84%
just can feel, it's the reason
why everything is connected.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.764 align:middle line:90%
The main rays of light were 12.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle line:84%
These 12 rays created
the first lights--

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:19.147 align:middle line:84%
the first ideas of how the
universe should be created.

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:22.651 align:middle line:84%
These structures
of light of sound

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:26.071 align:middle line:84%
were the different perspectives
and the different concepts

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
that we have from God,
from the universe,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.036 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we call the
vibrations of the truth.

00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:36.831 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call now
the archangels, the aspects

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.543 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that were
projected from this core

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and that filled the universe
with this energy creating

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.844 align:middle line:90%
ideas, visions, and dreams.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:52.389 align:middle line:84%
That's why we also call
the universe the dreamer,

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:57.811 align:middle line:84%
and we are its dreams that
are in a physical form trying

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle line:84%
to leave every
one of its dreams.

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:07.237 align:middle line:84%
The spirits that were
projected in these 12 shapes

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:12.617 align:middle line:84%
were the ones trying to create
different ways in which they

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
could experience this
creation, these ideas.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.582 align:middle line:84%
According to their
own vibration,

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:24.629 align:middle line:84%
they settle different aspects
of these experimentations.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.007 align:middle line:84%
So according to their
level of vibration,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:32.053 align:middle line:84%
they would have a name, a
vibration that represents them.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the groups of
spirits appear in the universe,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.437 align:middle line:84%
and that's where our
spiritual names come from.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
The vibrations in
which the light

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
was projected into the universe
created the different levels

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.866 align:middle line:84%
of sounds that creates what we
call now the spiritual names.

00:08:52.866 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:84%
These different
names could create

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.998 align:middle line:84%
the idea of structures in the
universe for the first time.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:04.919 align:middle line:84%
These 12 structures were
like mirrors reflecting

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:08.298 align:middle line:84%
the light of the spirits
towards the core.

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.885 align:middle line:84%
So as farthest the
light of consciousness

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:16.389 align:middle line:84%
would go in the universe,
these 12 structures of sound

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:21.436 align:middle line:84%
would create a mirror that would
shape the path towards the self

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.730 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:29.486 align:middle line:84%
This is like a big bowl
expanding through the universe,

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
but it is really not expanding.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.449 align:middle line:90%
It is going inside.

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:39.037 align:middle line:84%
As farther you go in
the outside, the closest

00:09:39.037 --> 00:09:42.207 align:middle line:90%
you are to the core.

00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:45.181 align:middle line:84%
This system created
like a labyrinth

00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:49.651 align:middle line:84%
in the universe in which
every being-- doesn't

00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:54.928 align:middle line:84%
matter where it goes, it
will always go to the inside.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:10:00.225 align:middle line:84%
And this was always repeated
once and again, once and again

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:03.186 align:middle line:84%
during the mind time
of the universe.

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:06.898 align:middle line:84%
This flow of energy through
positive going out and negative

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:11.361 align:middle line:84%
going in in between
the mirrors of mind

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:16.991 align:middle line:84%
created such amount of energy
that every one of the spirits

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:21.037 align:middle line:84%
could create their own
timelines and their own ideas

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.372 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:26.876 align:middle line:84%
So this idea about
leaving was one

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:30.129 align:middle line:84%
of the first things
that made spirits

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
to understand that they
were able to imagine

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.472 align:middle line:84%
the ways in which they could
live, experience, feel, smell,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:45.854 align:middle line:90%
see, touch all of their ideas.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:49.983 align:middle line:84%
The main idea of
the ether was to put

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:54.237 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the negative and
the positive in the magnetism.

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:58.199 align:middle line:84%
Magnetism for the mind
was this connection

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that put everything together
like a bond of vibration that

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.041 align:middle line:84%
makes everything
transform constantly

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.085 align:middle line:84%
in between positive
and negative.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.796 align:middle line:84%
So it would gather
every experience

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
of positive and
negative into one,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.888 align:middle line:84%
creating the structures that
would build for the first time

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:23.266 align:middle line:84%
the biggest structure
ever created

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.895 align:middle line:90%
in the universe, an atom.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:31.107 align:middle line:84%
This atom created
the first structure

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:36.237 align:middle line:84%
that was the bricks to
build every other reality.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:41.117 align:middle line:84%
That is why the main creation
of the spirit was the ether.

00:11:41.117 --> 00:11:44.495 align:middle line:84%
The ether put together
all the structures

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:48.625 align:middle line:84%
of positive and negative,
and by bending itself

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.609 align:middle line:84%
through time and
space would start

00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:55.256 align:middle line:84%
to create different
ideas of structures

00:11:55.256 --> 00:12:02.722 align:middle line:84%
that we after that call
the earth, the water, fire,

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.641 align:middle line:90%
and air.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:06.601 align:middle line:84%
And in Atlantan
times and Khem time,

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:10.438 align:middle line:84%
we understood the tetrahedron
is the species of fire,

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:14.442 align:middle line:84%
the cube is a species of
earth, the icosahedron

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.236 align:middle line:84%
is a species of air,
and the dodecahedron

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.446 align:middle line:90%
is the species of water.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:21.699 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the ethereal beings

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:27.747 align:middle line:84%
in the octahedran,
which is the self.

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:35.004 align:middle line:84%
So these statements of reality
were all bounded by the ether.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Ether is related for humans
like the energy of love.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Love is the closest
concept that we could have

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.728 align:middle line:90%
to understand what ether is.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:53.856 align:middle line:90%
Love is similar to gravity.

00:12:53.856 --> 00:13:00.071 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is the connection in
between all the realities,

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.449 align:middle line:84%
but gravity is
not something that

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:05.576 align:middle line:90%
attaches polarity together.

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:10.498 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is the strings
being stretched

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:13.584 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.045 align:middle line:84%
Space and time are
the same thing,

00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:21.968 align:middle line:84%
are all these structures. that
you can relate with the spider

00:13:21.968 --> 00:13:26.431 align:middle line:84%
web that you can stretch in the
universe, and by stretching it,

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:32.061 align:middle line:84%
all the ties get this high
level of vibration or low level

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of vibration like in
a guitar, the strings

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.276 align:middle line:84%
of a piano or a
guitar, that starts

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:40.069 align:middle line:90%
to vibrate in different levels.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So gravity is not something
that pulls us towards something.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.536 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is
stretching realities

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.039 align:middle line:90%
and that connects them all.

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
you have a spider

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.047 align:middle line:84%
web in the mind in this
reality like neurons connecting

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:02.008 align:middle line:84%
the whole network of
reality and you just

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:08.056 align:middle line:84%
put your hand in four
places of this network

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:13.811 align:middle line:84%
and you just start to tie them
to turn it so it stretches

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.271 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So all the strings start
to be really tight.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And that creates
the idea of water.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.744 align:middle line:84%
That creates the idea
of earth, fire, and air.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.955 align:middle line:84%
But the strings are the
same for all of them.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth element is
indeed the first one,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.463 align:middle line:84%
the main material of mind that
connects all the vibrations

00:14:40.463 --> 00:14:43.382 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:47.845 align:middle line:84%
This structure of
creation was the one

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:53.184 align:middle line:84%
that bent the ninth, eighth,
seventh and sixth dimension

00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:58.815 align:middle line:84%
into the fifth, fourth,
third, and second dimension.

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
This structure created the
new idea of the universe

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.241 align:middle line:84%
so every one of the portals
created through ether

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:12.328 align:middle line:84%
would be able to not
only believed in the time

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:14.914 align:middle line:90%
but also believed in the space.

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:20.211 align:middle line:84%
So what before it was the
species of earth, fire, air,

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:25.383 align:middle line:84%
and water in the ether
realities now would bend itself

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:28.678 align:middle line:84%
so many times once and
again in every expression

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.639 align:middle line:84%
that the vibration
of the atoms would

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:36.811 align:middle line:84%
be stretched so much and so much
that gravity would be harder.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.981 align:middle line:84%
And this gravity would
attach by vibration.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.692 align:middle line:84%
All the other atoms
in the same rhythm

00:15:42.692 --> 00:15:45.736 align:middle line:84%
are vibrations creating
the first structures

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:50.241 align:middle line:84%
of minerals of water and
the first sparks of fire

00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:54.787 align:middle line:84%
and the first gases
that created air.

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:59.125 align:middle line:84%
Ether then was this energy
that connects every reality

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:06.048 align:middle line:84%
through time and space, and once
you have these different levels

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:10.595 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the universe
and this vibration

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:15.224 align:middle line:84%
creating the names, each one
of them has their own job.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:19.187 align:middle line:84%
Their own job was to
relate their own process

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:23.941 align:middle line:84%
through earth, through
fire, through air,

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:28.237 align:middle line:84%
through water in the past, in
the present, and the future.

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:32.992 align:middle line:84%
So we have the total phases
calling the 12 archangels

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:37.413 align:middle line:84%
of reality or also in the sixth
dimension the 12 architects

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:90%
of realities.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.085 align:middle line:84%
The 12 architects were
not people or beings

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:46.047 align:middle line:84%
outside the system
creating the system.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:49.258 align:middle line:84%
They were the
conjunction of ideas

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:55.556 align:middle line:84%
that are connected by the
same amount of energy that

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:59.435 align:middle line:84%
modifies itself in order to
see the different perspectives

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.979 align:middle line:90%
of itself.

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:06.858 align:middle line:84%
This being is for the
image is like a puppet

00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:10.488 align:middle line:84%
with many strings, and
each one of those strings

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.115 align:middle line:84%
is like one of those
rays of light coming

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:15.159 align:middle line:84%
from the core of
the universe that

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.412 align:middle line:84%
moves through
vibration the only one

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:20.205 align:middle line:90%
being that they are projecting.

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:24.961 align:middle line:84%
So every one of
our spirits is just

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:32.385 align:middle line:84%
a line, a string that is moving
the body of an archangel.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:35.596 align:middle line:84%
This main structure
helps us to understand

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:38.391 align:middle line:84%
that every creation
in the universe

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:42.270 align:middle line:84%
is being created
by each one of us.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.439 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
bigger creating us.

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.366 align:middle line:84%
It's the smallest
part of. the universe

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:51.529 align:middle line:90%
creating the biggest ones.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:55.157 align:middle line:84%
By understanding
that every being is

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
an energy that we call soul
and that we all are connected

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.832 align:middle line:84%
through time and space,
we can understand

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:08.838 align:middle line:84%
that everything is just one.
only being divided into many.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:13.551 align:middle line:84%
And that also explains
the relationships

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:17.388 align:middle line:84%
we have with other
souls, with the families.

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:21.559 align:middle line:84%
The souls that are
bounded in families,

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:23.519 align:middle line:90%
they travel in groups.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.813 align:middle line:90%
They are all the same vibration.

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:27.857 align:middle line:84%
So what we can
understand about that

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.193 align:middle line:84%
is that every being
being connected

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:35.865 align:middle line:84%
are just different bodies
of just one only soul.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:40.578 align:middle line:84%
This means that as the tree
has only one trunk, which

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:43.247 align:middle line:84%
is the spirit divided
in different souls,

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:46.292 align:middle line:84%
these souls that
are energy start

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:50.838 align:middle line:84%
to split like mitosis to create
many other souls from just one

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:53.883 align:middle line:84%
vibration, and those
other souls can

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:57.595 align:middle line:84%
leave many and different
lives through the matter.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:03.601 align:middle line:84%
So we can think that
our body has one soul,

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:08.731 align:middle line:84%
but we are part of
groups of souls.

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.984 align:middle line:84%
Normally to understand
how many souls are just

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.445 align:middle line:84%
one body in the
universe, you need

00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:19.575 align:middle line:84%
to multiply yourself
and find the number 144.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:25.456 align:middle line:84%
Once you have 144, you will
find the amount of souls

00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.917 align:middle line:90%
that are bounded to you.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:34.131 align:middle line:84%
This 144 creates the structure
of what we call the octahedron.

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is the
being, but each one of US

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.678 align:middle line:90%
has its own octahedron.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.972 align:middle line:84%
But in the universe
there are thousands

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:48.104 align:middle line:84%
of octahedrons that are created
by 144 souls which are all

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.439 align:middle line:90%
connected to just one soul.

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
This only being that
has this 144 aspects

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.823 align:middle line:84%
are all these
soulmates that we have

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:03.285 align:middle line:84%
in every planet, every
dimension, every world so

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:06.872 align:middle line:84%
in the ethereal realities
and the physical realities,

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:08.624 align:middle line:90%
so that's the bigger soul.

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:12.253 align:middle line:84%
That's the big
soul that unites us

00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:17.174 align:middle line:84%
all in different
parallel realities.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
All these different beings
that exist in just one soul

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.431 align:middle line:84%
are divided in different
times and different spaces,

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.392 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't mean that
they are living all

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:30.396 align:middle line:84%
as humans in our own
reality in this time.

00:20:30.396 --> 00:20:34.442 align:middle line:84%
They can be in different
times in different spaces

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.318 align:middle line:90%
and be different realities.

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:41.449 align:middle line:84%
So maybe one of those
soulmates are just a stone.

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:45.536 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of them are living
in Jupiter or out of the galaxy.

00:20:45.536 --> 00:20:48.956 align:middle line:84%
They are split all
over their reality

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:51.292 align:middle line:84%
because they are just
mirrors through time

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.586 align:middle line:90%
and space of yourself.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:58.048 align:middle line:84%
So it's not something
we need to look for.

00:20:58.048 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's something we need
to be connected to.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:09.477 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all this structure
of octahedrons one matching

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:14.773 align:middle line:84%
with the other like creating
this structure of geometry

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:18.319 align:middle line:84%
that dividing itself into
thousands and thousands

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:22.907 align:middle line:84%
of millions could create
billions and billions of beings

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:27.703 align:middle line:90%
that are just one soul.

00:21:27.703 --> 00:21:30.748 align:middle line:84%
This structure can
create a sphere,

00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:36.295 align:middle line:84%
and this sphere that is
created is just one soul

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:41.759 align:middle line:84%
that is divided in thousands
of souls all connected to one

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:45.221 align:middle line:90%
core, which is the spirit.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:48.057 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call
the spiritus mundi.

00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:52.186 align:middle line:84%
The spiritus mundi is how
thousands and billions

00:21:52.186 --> 00:21:56.357 align:middle line:84%
of beings related
in just one sphere

00:21:56.357 --> 00:22:00.986 align:middle line:84%
are projections of
just one same energy.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:06.242 align:middle line:84%
So every being doesn't matter
which realm, which time,

00:22:06.242 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:90%
which space.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.957 align:middle line:84%
They are all just projections
from one only self

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:19.338 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't matter through which
reality, through which animal,

00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
plant, stone, human, doesn't
matter in which dimension

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:28.514 align:middle line:84%
in this planet if fourth
dimension, fifth dimension

00:22:28.514 --> 00:22:31.183 align:middle line:84%
of earth, in the
third dimension,

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:35.104 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter to which one
of them are you related to.

00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:38.983 align:middle line:84%
You are connected
to the same spirit.

00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:43.612 align:middle line:84%
That was a term
used by the ancients

00:22:43.612 --> 00:22:48.993 align:middle line:84%
to explain how alchemy worked
because the transformation

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:54.164 align:middle line:84%
of realities was not
how to handle or modify

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:56.083 align:middle line:90%
structures outside yourself.

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:59.295 align:middle line:84%
It was to know that
you are a projection

00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:03.382 align:middle line:90%
from the core of this mundus.

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:06.844 align:middle line:84%
And from that core, you
could be able to relate

00:23:06.844 --> 00:23:10.639 align:middle line:84%
with the main structure
of every being that

00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:12.349 align:middle line:90%
is living in this world.

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:18.939 align:middle line:84%
So by changing yourself,
you can change this reality.

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:21.859 align:middle line:84%
It's not a concept that
helps us understand

00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:23.611 align:middle line:90%
that everything has a spirit.

00:23:23.611 --> 00:23:27.489 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to understand that
everything is just one spirit.

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:32.828 align:middle line:84%
And if you reach that one
spirit, you become the world.

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:35.331 align:middle line:84%
This is the connection
to the divine,

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:39.918 align:middle line:84%
and the beings that were related
to it have different names.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:44.089 align:middle line:84%
One of them was Buddha
who could relate itself

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.966 align:middle line:90%
with the beings of the nature.

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:50.012 align:middle line:84%
That's why he knew that he
could understand himself

00:23:50.012 --> 00:23:54.600 align:middle line:84%
through the beings alive that
doesn't matter if they were

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.852 align:middle line:90%
animals or plants or humans.

00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:59.438 align:middle line:84%
He could talk with the
spirit of the world.

00:23:59.438 --> 00:24:02.691 align:middle line:84%
And another one of them
that we know the most

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:08.238 align:middle line:84%
was Jesus when he connected
with the pattern of vibration

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:11.992 align:middle line:84%
that the ancients call
the spirit of the world

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:15.579 align:middle line:84%
that in four letters
we call Yweh.

00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:20.417 align:middle line:84%
This concept is just the
vibration of the spirit.

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:22.544 align:middle line:84%
It's not someone
outside the planet.

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the planet, and that's
the goal of all of the beings

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.304 align:middle line:84%
that are willing to
change realities.

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.932 align:middle line:84%
You-- in order to
change the world

00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
and to use the alchemy
to transform the matter,

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.939 align:middle line:84%
you have to become the spirit
that projects every matter,

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:46.694 align:middle line:84%
and that's the concept
of spiritus mundi.

00:24:46.694 --> 00:24:48.946 align:middle line:84%
So every being in
other dimensions

00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:52.199 align:middle line:84%
was a projection that
went through the patterns

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:56.203 align:middle line:84%
of darkness to find the
different possibilities

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:58.956 align:middle line:84%
of itself, creating
consciousness

00:24:58.956 --> 00:25:01.667 align:middle line:84%
through civilizations,
through species

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:05.337 align:middle line:84%
that would be able
to allow spirits

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to live their own dreams.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.512 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we now
are our own dreams.

00:25:13.512 --> 00:25:17.558 align:middle line:84%
We are living the dreams that
we created in many dimensions,

00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:19.935 align:middle line:84%
but we are not
separate from them.

00:25:19.935 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
We are all ether that are
very stretched in the gravity

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:31.155 align:middle line:84%
that we are pulling so
the spirits can feel,

00:25:31.155 --> 00:25:35.826 align:middle line:84%
can hear, can listen,
can see, can touch,

00:25:35.826 --> 00:25:45.753 align:middle line:84%
can be born so we all spiritual
beings can live our own dreams.

00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:47.463 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:50.048 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.301 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will discover

00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
how the six dimensional
architects of realities

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.557 align:middle line:84%
create experiences and
worlds through matter

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:02.476 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution
of consciousness.
