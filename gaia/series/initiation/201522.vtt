>> How was the concept
of Atlantis formed?

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.085 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
the beginning of Atlantis.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:84%
When I was born in the
colony of Atlantis,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember everything
that we could possibly

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
know about Atlantis, about
our mother civilization,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.940 align:middle line:84%
through the stories of my
grandfather in that life.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather used to tell all
the stories about our families.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most important
stories that they had

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
was that we all came from the
breathing of the universe.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The breathing of the universe
was called ham, het, hum.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we called the
universe at that time

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
was the consciousness of
every dimension creating us.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So we were the
sons and daughters

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:90%
of the breath of the universe.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And after the breath, nine tears
were dropped in the universe

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that we called the
nine dimensions.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And from the sixth dimension,
and then the third dimension,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
four statements came to this
planet for the first time.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And the story said, the
first ones in arriving

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
were the Nemnir then the
Soffhir, then the Alithir,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:90%
and then the Aessir.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And the Aessir had sons
and daughters with humans.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.675 align:middle line:84%
And that created us, the Sem,
the people from Atlantis.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:10%
The Atlantean
people were what we

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:10%
used to call Khef or Khefian.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:10%
They were the sons
of the first mixed

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:10%
between those people coming
from the stars and those people

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:10%
from Earth.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Humans and the Aessir--

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that you may know
like Annunaki--

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
were the first
ones to be engaged

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:90%
and to make a civilization.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So the first humans created,
as we know them today,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.090 align:middle line:84%
were sons and daughters of
them in the Middle East.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
All the creation of Atlantis
was around 16,000 BC.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.540 align:middle line:84%
In between 4,000 to 5,000
years before Atlantis

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
began as a
civilization, the Aessir

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
were testing to see if
their DNA from the stars

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
was able to be readapt
in this planet.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The giant Aessir were
from outside this planet.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can accept
the energy of this planet

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:90%
is by being born here.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Aessir and
Nemnir and other cultures that

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
came from the stars, it was so
difficult for them to survive

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
here because everything changed
really fast in this planet--

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:90%
weather, geography, everything.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
adapting everyday--

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:90%
viruses, bacteria.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
couldn't stand

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
the constant transformation
of this planet.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why most of them had
these meetings in which they

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:84%
said, if we don't transcend
ourselves through our kids,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:90%
then we will just be myths.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And we will die.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the Aessir
split in two groups--

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
the ones willing to control
humanity and the ones

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:84%
willing to live
through humanity.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:84%
There were many parts of this
Aessir that have this child.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were treating
them in different ways.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:84%
There were some
Aessir that treat

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
the humans like their own
kids-- like sons and daughters.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:90%
So they were family for them.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And they understood
the importance

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
of transcend their DNA, their
culture through the culture

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:90%
and the DNA of humans.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were
protecting them and treating

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:90%
them like their family.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:84%
But there were other
ones that thought

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
about humans like slaves to
harvest energy and harvest

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:90%
mineral.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:84%
As we need salt here to survive
in our bodies, some minerals

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
in our blood, they needed
gold and some other minerals

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:90%
to survive in their planets.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So because their
planets were dying,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to
reach other places.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
Confederation guided them here,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because their DNA was able
to match with the humans.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's why they came here.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But they use humans to find
this gold for them to survive.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So what they needed is to
put this powder of gold

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and breathe this powder of
gold, put it in the skin,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and that would made
them all the minerals

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
necessary to survive
in this planet,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:90%
to have more light from the sun.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But there were
other civilizations

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that were looking for us
long before Aessir came here.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:90%
And those were their Arcturians.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Arcturian people
were the ones working

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
with those Aessir that treat the
humans like sons and daughters.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to propose
to those Aessir to protect,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
like a father, the most
important sons and daughters

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:90%
from their creations.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And they promised them that if
they would take care of them

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and they would transform
their DNA into the blue ones,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
instead of the Aessir,
what would happen

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:84%
was that they would
transcend into the light.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:10%
And they will be
eternal forever.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:10%
So that's why some Aessir
and some Arcturians

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:10%
did a trade in
which they decided

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.510 align:middle line:10%
to choose some of these
kids that they had created

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:10%
and take it very far away
from where other Aessir could

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:10%
find them.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
These kids were
prepared to be the sons

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:90%
and daughters of the stars.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, in order
to bring the information

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
from other levels
of consciousness,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
they needed to
have in their blood

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:90%
these levels of consciousness.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
And the planet has 12 doors--

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:84%
12 doors to 12
constellations, 12 doors

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and portals through the stars
that open the information

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
from every constellation.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
choose 12 kids--

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
girls and boys-- to be the basin
to put all this information

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:90%
in their water, in their blood.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.630 align:middle line:84%
These 12 first kids were
called the 12 families.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:10%
As we call it in Khem,
they were the Dasnai.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:10%
Dasnai means the great
families, the big families.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.380 align:middle line:10%
And those families were brought
through the Indian Ocean

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:10%
and the Mediterranean
Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:10%
so they could seed their new
kids their new information very

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:10%
far away from the Aessir
that treat them like slaves.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So these 12 kids would be
taught to be gods on Earth.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:90%


00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:10%
The father of civilization
for Atlanteans were Thalan.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:10%
Thalan was what the
Greek called Poseidon.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:10%
Thalan was this Aessir with
all these other Aessirs

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:10%
that before they had
this idea of creating

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:10%
what after was Atlantis, they
would spread their regions

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:10%
in the Middle East.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Middle East, as I said,
was the main portal

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:90%
of the planet at the time.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
and all the energy

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:90%
flowed better in that region.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So they would be
connected to the stars,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
even if they were
living here on Earth.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So the main region where
all these beings were living

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
was all the region of
Anatolia, Iran, part of Africa,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:90%
and part of Asia.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a long period of time
in which the Aessir where

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:84%
trying to decide what
to do with his world

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and what was their purpose here.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
As I said, they
knew that they were

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
going to die eventually
because they were not

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.930 align:middle line:90%
able to live in this planet.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying, in one
way, to take as many resources

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
possible from this
world, and the other ones

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:84%
to survive through
the reproduction

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and through the
living with the humans

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and transcending
through history.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Thalan was the one in
charge of the islands

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
in the Indian Ocean and the
southern regions of Arabia

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and the Persian Gulf.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:10%
This portal, the most
important portal,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:10%
was where today is the Oman
Peninsula, Musandam, that we

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:10%
call the Portal of Ahura Mazda.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:10%
This portal was in charge
of Poseidon-- of Thalan.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:10%
So all the information
from the sun and the moon

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:10%
would come to their lands.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:10%
This main spot was connected
to the main portal of the sun.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
from the spiritual world

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
would be downloaded through
the Musandam Peninsula

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:84%
and reach the whole Eden Garden
in the Persian Gulf and Iran

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and all the mountains
till Anatolia.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So all this power was
brought from the sun.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
But that way it could be
downloaded and understood here

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:84%
on Earth was through
the energy of the moon.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, in
Khem and Atlantis,

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:90%
we call the moon in-ku.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:10%
In-ku meant the protector,
the one that protected Earth.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:10%
And in-ku was this feminine,
masculine aspect of reality.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that the moon was
moving the energy of the water.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So we knew it was
connected to the water.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
That is why Thalan
was the one in charge

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.030 align:middle line:84%
to decode the information
coming from the moon

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:84%
here on this planet
through the water.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we related
him with the project

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of giving water the
information from the stars.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is why their
sons and daughters

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
were the ones able to adapt
that information from the stars,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
from the light of the
moon, from the waters

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:90%
into their own blood.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
When he realized that his own
information and the information

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of the divine in
the Middle East was

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
kept in the blood
of his own children,

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:84%
the other Aessir around were
willing to conquer and to have

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:90%
that information from them.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is why he decided
to protect his own child.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And he became the
protector of the seas,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:90%
what we call the Thalan.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:10%
So Thalan became the
protector of the new humanity

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:10%
because he took care of his
own children in faraway islands

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:10%
where other Aessir
couldn't find them,

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:10%
so the information of
the moon and the sun

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.225 align:middle line:10%
could be here on the blood and
the cells of their own childs.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Thalan was not a god, but
they treat him like that.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Because for them,
Thalan was the one

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
that brought them
through the seas

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to be protected from the
Giants around the planet.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he was the father
of the mother civilization.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The 12 families, at
first, had to learn

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:90%
about how to live on the Earth.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
They were meant to understand
the ways of this planet.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were prohibited
to go out the islands.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
As some Aessir prohibited
the first humans

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to go out from the Middle East--

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:90%
like we know the Eden Garden--

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
these other families,
they were prohibited

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to go out from the islands.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the project
of humans, we

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
were meant to
bring consciousness

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So while the Arcturians
and other beings

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
were thinking about
these families,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
where we have to prepare
them to understand

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:90%
how to find the power within.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So when they go outside
they don't build an empire,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:90%
they just built a network.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
As the Mu people
were trying to bring

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:84%
this idea of a network in
this beehive along the Pacific

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, the idea
of Atlantis people

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:84%
was to create this
network of humans

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
around the planet that
for the first time

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
would create a civilization
bonded to the planet.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they could go
to the 12 phases of the Earth,

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and to
download information

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
from every constellation--
but from the self, the being,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and not one against other.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of Atlantis at the
first time was to create, then,

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
a civilization capable to
be adapted to this planet,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to be part of this planet
for the first time,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and to survive in this planet.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And while doing
this, the next step

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:84%
was to see if their culture
and civilization were

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:84%
able to resonate with
the heart of the planet

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.370 align:middle line:84%
so the whole network
of the galaxy

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.174 align:middle line:84%
would be harmonious with
this planet in awakening.

00:15:14.174 --> 00:15:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
The moment when the
Arcturian people came

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and, in the voice of
the Confederation,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.250 align:middle line:84%
they decided that
humans were able already

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
to create the first civilization
according to the idea of

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
put this planet in balance
with the Confederation,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
the process of the
Aessir was finished.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.640 align:middle line:84%
They understood that
it was just a step

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:90%
in our process of evolution.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
In our history when we
listen about the Annunaki

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Aessir,
what we have in mind

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
is that they came here to
create the human experiment.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And that they where our
fathers and mothers.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And that they were the
first ones on creating us.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, not
even them knew that they

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:90%
were part of the experiment.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
we need to understand

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to know why they
had to disappear

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and why they were sent
to the underground.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Because at the
moment when humans

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
were able to survive to
all the bacteria, virus,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and environment of
this planet and they

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
were ready to hold information
from the stars in this planet,

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
so Arcturians and other
beings from the Confederation

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
just said, OK, it's
time for them to leave.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was in that moment,
when the Aessir-- the

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Annunaki-- realized
that they were also

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:90%
a step in the project.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
The human experiment was
not their experiment.

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It was a big experiment
that spiritual beings

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension
created so they

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.109 align:middle line:84%
could experience every
emotion and every potential

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:90%
in just one planet.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.069 align:middle line:84%
So it was just ourselves
in the sixth dimension

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
creating the Confederation
so we could find the Aessir--

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the Annunaki-- to find a
planet, to seed the seed

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:84%
so we can create humans
so we could be born.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So the human experiment
is not an Annunaki thing.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They were part of
the experiment.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So in the big
project, they decided

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.660 align:middle line:84%
that Aessir had ended their
part, their step of evolution.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians tried to
talk to those Aessir that

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
had a little bit of
consciousness to teach them--

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.753 align:middle line:84%
we know that you have
the power to understand,

00:17:55.753 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness to
understand that you

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:84%
have to leave now the
planet because now it's

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:90%
beginning another process.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And those are the ones
that gave the information--

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
a heritage to humans,
the tree of life,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.775 align:middle line:84%
the information of
DNA, the information

00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of the snake, what to
do when they were not

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:90%
here, how to become powerful.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And there were the other ones
in the Middle East saying,

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:84%
we are not going to give
up with this information.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Humans should not
know about this.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:90%
And both of them were right.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the ones giving
the information to humans,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
they knew that
through blood they

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
will awake the wisdom to
understand how the world works.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was
that we were hominids.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:90%
We were Homo sapiens.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:90%
We had no idea where we were.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So all this knowledge
was so powerful for us

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
in such a tiny time of time
that we couldn't handle it.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we needed
to be prepared in islands

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and to be protected
until we could understand

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.410 align:middle line:90%
all this information.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So the ones keeping the
information from humans

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
were the ones saying,
they are not ready.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how to
handle this information.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So that was their
defend on why not

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:84%
to give them the
information of what they

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:90%
were, the project of humanity.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So they kept that
information for them.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were
sent to the underground.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:90%
They were hunting them.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a war in between
the beings from the sky

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and the Giants on Earth
that were held in part

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:90%
of Middle East and India.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And these beings were
called in the ancient texts

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
demons and angels fighting
a big war on the planet.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:90%
But there were not many.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:84%
There were just hundreds
of people from the Aessir.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%
There were not thousands.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying to use
humans to fight for them.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
But when humans realized
that we were working

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
for them, what happened
was the biggest strike

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
in the history of humanity
when they just decided

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:90%
not to work anymore for them.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So the Confederation
came to this planet,

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and they started to change
the vibration of the planet.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
The main technology
that they used to have

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:90%
wasn't the light and energy.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It was the vibration.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
The vibration, the
music, the sounds

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
were the tools that
these civilizations

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
had to transform realities.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the magnetical
reality of every matter--

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
like the magnetic
field of our planet--

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
is easy to change
through vibration.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:84%
When the planet starts
to vibrate different,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
or the sun starts to
vibrate different,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
the waves of time and
space switch a little bit

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.830 align:middle line:84%
the magnetical
realities of our worlds.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to move the
magnetical north pole and south

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:90%
pole towards different regions.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is very low and
very slow in history.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:84%
This is something natural
that happens in thousands

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:90%
or millions of years.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes,
usually, when they

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
have to make a very quick change
in some world, what they do

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
is to send a very
high wave of vibration

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that changed the way
that everything which

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:90%
is magnetical--

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:84%
the weather mostly--
in the planet changed.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So the change of
weather in 16,000 BC,

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
it was forced by them so we
could clear the planet of all

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
these beings that
were not able to adapt

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to this change of weather.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
The cold that
Nemnir were used to,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.220 align:middle line:84%
the Hyperborea civilization
were used to that cold.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:90%
But the Aessir wasn't.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
live in Middle East,

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
in some regions of
the Mediterranean Sea,

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:90%
in India and Pakistan.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:84%
All that region was
part of their empire.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
But what really happened
to them when the cold came,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
it was that they couldn't
stand to live in the surface.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Weather forced the
Aessir to go underground.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.830 align:middle line:84%
That's how we also knew that
humans were able to adapt.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the change was so
fast that many creatures--

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
animals, plants, and
also the Aessir--

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.620 align:middle line:90%
they couldn't stand the cold.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the process of
cooling the planet was longer.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But the first stage
was the one that

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
led the Confederation
know that humans

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.040 align:middle line:84%
were the only ones
with consciousness

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
able to survive in this planet
even if the weather changes.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed
the Mu civilization

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
to grow, and the
Atlantean ones to begin

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:90%
with their process of society.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The Aessir that
hadn't died, they

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
were sent to live
in the underground.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of
humans in history of humanity

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.560 align:middle line:84%
in every place, they would
say that the Giants went

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:90%
to live underground.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Giants would only
talk through the doors

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.935 align:middle line:90%
of volcanoes and caves.

00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, we
knew that the world

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:90%
was divided in three--

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the one in heaven, the one in
the surface, and the one below.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
The one below was what
the ancient Greeks

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
called the Averno, and
we know today as hell.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But this place was not
related to demons, was not

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:90%
related to bad things.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
It was related to their
underground cities,

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
the underground realm
of all the beings

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
that were here from many,
many thousands of years.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.650 align:middle line:84%
That they carved these tunnels
connecting the whole planet,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:84%
so they could survive even if
the weather would change around

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
This allowed them to survive
through thousands and millions

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And they had built these
structures and cities

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:84%
in the underground that are
not only in just one spot.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
They go below every main spot
of the planet, every main portal

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.890 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And they carved these
lines and these tunnels

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to connect all this network
that some people call now

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:90%
the Agartha.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.720 align:middle line:84%
These structures in the
underground, for us,

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:17.120 align:middle line:84%
were the places where the
energy of the planet was kept,

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:84%
the information of
the planet was kept.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And for us, it was not
the place to have fear of.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:26.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a place where
all the registry

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens and
the surface used

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:90%
to go when their time was over.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
This network is around
every continent,

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:90%
and also under some seas.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were, in
some point, used

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
by some humans in the past.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But usually, the Aessir,
Nemnir, and Soffhir,

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who
used these tunnels.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.430 align:middle line:84%
The first ones on going
there were the Soffhir.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:84%
They had to rebuild
their own civilizations

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:90%
in the underground.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were guided by all
these other new civilizations

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
coming from the stars to
create this idea of keeping

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of our planet
within the planet.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:84%
These underground cities were
also in the fifth dimension.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:10%
So they were able to
communicate with other planets

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:10%
in the Confederation using
the electromagnetic fields

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:10%
of the planet.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
happened in the Confederation

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:84%
was that we wouldn't
allow humans

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
to go to some planets
that were very subtle.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And humans could kill them
just by laughing, or loving,

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.870 align:middle line:90%
or being mad, as we are here--

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:51.770 align:middle line:90%
too many emotions.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
cut the communication

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
with other planets through
the network below Earth,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:84%
so humans wouldn't travel
through time and space.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:11.510 align:middle line:84%
This idea of those people who
once controlled the planet

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
living in the underground
was the concept

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that created this
idea in humanity

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that the devil, the demons,
the Giants, the monsters

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
were living in hell
in underground.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And that created
this idea that we

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:84%
have to fear what's
happening in the underground.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And because most of the
Aessir that went to a jail

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:84%
inside the Earth, as I
remember the stories,

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
they used to scream
and shout and be

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.380 align:middle line:84%
mad about now humans taking
the control of the Earth.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And they're losing it it.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, for
us, it was prohibited

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.910 align:middle line:84%
to go to the underground
for a long time

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
because we were scared that
they could come out again.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
At the moment when the
Aessir leave the surface

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and go to the underground,
for the first time

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
humans were alone.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
But there were three
types of humans--

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the one that were very
ancient, the ones that

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
were modified and were
walking around the planet

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and established settlements
for agriculture,

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and those in the islands
that had an idea that they

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
were created by gods.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But they felt that they
were abandoned by some

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.870 align:middle line:90%
of their fathers and mothers.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
It was like losing
their gods and loosing

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:54.750 align:middle line:84%
their guidance of how to
survive in this planet.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.820 align:middle line:10%
But the main thing that
the Aessir gave to humans

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.980 align:middle line:10%
was agriculture.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So they stopped being nomads to
create the first settlements.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Tribes start to appear because
they needed our organization

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and leadership to
guide the people.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.670 align:middle line:84%
That was a good
thing for humanity

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:84%
because we, for the
first time, realized

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that we were the ones
with the power of Earth.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And nobody but us could teach
us or to tell us what to do.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.950 align:middle line:84%
We had agriculture to
take care of ourselves.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And we had also the idea of
the equinox and solstice.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And we begin the
civilization again

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:84%
from that, beginning from
the tools that they gave us.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.414 align:middle line:90%
