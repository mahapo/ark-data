00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> How were humans
chosen to become gods?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
why the Confederation decided

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:10%
to make humans into gods and
how this decision rippled

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:10%
through the galaxy.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The main concept of
the whole universe

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is to be aware of the
self, and that self

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:90%
is what we call now God.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So, in the first dimension
that God was created by itself,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
by the idea of a
creator generating

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
all the vibrations in the
universe, so every timeline,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.420 align:middle line:84%
every spot of the space
in every dimension,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:84%
the main structure
that he created,

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
that it created to shape
this idea of finding itself

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
was this first geometrical
path towards the time and space

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:84%
that was designed in
the sixth dimension.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Through the sixth
dimension, the pattern

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
started to breathe and
to flow into the fifth

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth dimension by
time and the idea of the purpose

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.290 align:middle line:90%
of reaching the concept of God.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:10%
The fifth dimension
would help us

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:10%
to understand the main
idea of the whole process.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We needed to evolve to
prove ourselves that we were

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:90%
able to become gods ourselves.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And that means that this
idea of the tree, the tree

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
creating itself and
expressing itself

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:90%
in so many different beings.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the last process
of its creation,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
it would create
thousands of seeds

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that has the same potential
that the whole tree,

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:84%
so whenever they
are seeded, they

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
could become their new
gods, the new universes.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And this concept was the process
in which the universe expressed

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
itself outside and created
the seeds so it could return

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
to itself, finding that
every part of itself

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:84%
was just a fertilization,
a tiny part of it.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So, every one of those
seeds was the connection

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to get into the consciousness
of the awareness of the self

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
so the beings in the tree
could realize that they are God

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and that they can
become new gods.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So, all the process of
evolution in the unconscious

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.570 align:middle line:84%
way of matter was
to improve itself

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
as much as possible to
reach the forces of the sun,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
of the light in the galaxies, to
reach the main source of energy

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
through the light, and
in the consciousness

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:84%
way was to seek that
light inside, within.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So, the unconscious path
would look the answers

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and feed the emotions
through the outer world,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
the outer material creation,
while the conscience would

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
reach the main idea of
God in the self within.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
The main structures that
move around the universe

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
are the stars and
the galaxies that

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
holds this pattern
of creation, that

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
holds this pattern
of the divine,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.300 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the different aspects
of the self towards the matter.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:10%
These portals are called
the constellations

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:10%
that from the sixth
dimension breathe

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:10%
the energy like a heartbeat
from the core of the universe

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:10%
and aware of the self of
God towards every part

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of the separation, the
distortion of realities.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So, this breathing, would
contact the main idea

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
of the divine with the aspects
in the matter of the divine.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:84%
This means that around
the whole universe,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
we would have these
patterns in the stars that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
would model our
structure of who we

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
are, and will settle the paths
towards this recognizement.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And we needed to go
through all this path

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand that every
reality that we were living

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:84%
was just an aspect of
God, of the Goddess.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
When a planet starts
to be aware of itself,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
going from the
unconscious process

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to the conscious
process, all the portals

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
through the constellations
to the core of the universe

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
are being opened and start
to breathe the information.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And that means that every
being in the constellations

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
can feel how these worlds start
to be breathing and eating

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:84%
this energy in between
dimensions, so they could reach

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:90%
more awareness of themselves.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:10%
This is the moment, the pattern
when all the conscious beings

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:10%
of the Confederation
who are living

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:10%
in these different planets
around the constellations

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:10%
can reach, can seek
for those planets that

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:10%
are being connected
to this network

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:10%
to become part of the aware God.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:10%
So this creates
the idea, the path

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.740 align:middle line:10%
that every being in
those constellations

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:10%
has to go to those
planets and seed

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:10%
the seeds of this information.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:10%
They became the
fruits, the flowers

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:10%
of this big tree of
life in the universe,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:10%
and they took the seeds from
within to seed it in this world

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:10%
so these worlds could be,
again, like these planets that

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:10%
become new trees so
they could breathe

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:10%
and they could
create a new reality.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that,
we needed to seek

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
for the conscious society
or the conscious beings

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in this planet to improve their
DNA so they could download

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
that information
in the planet, they

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
could understand
that information,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and to be ready to become the
words of God in material shape.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:10%
There was the plan
of building societies

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.000 align:middle line:10%
around every constellation
that represent gods and matter.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And that was the goal
that in our planet

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
was called making
humans into gods.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Making humans into gods, as we
did in different other planets

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
in different constellations,
was to bring the information

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
from every constellation
and to shape

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:84%
the path towards the
self, to shape the path

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to awake the potential
that we had in our DNA,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and also seed this
potential from other trees

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
so we could have
all the information

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
from other planets that had
already worked in this process.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
The way you can tell when is
the moment when a planet is

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware is by the
position of these portals

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of the planet,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
you can see every
portal around you,

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the
connection between them,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:84%
creating the
spectrum of the path.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:10%
The spectrum of the path
would be the 12 beings

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:10%
that are creating the path
for the biggest species

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:10%
in the reality, which
is the species of earth,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:10%
the water, air, and fire.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:10%
These species create this path
towards the enlightenment,

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:10%
towards the awareness
of a being in which we

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:10%
have to go through all of them
to understand every perspective

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:10%
of a self, of a planet.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So, that allows us to
receive the information

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:90%
from different dimensions.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like to understand
the whole world,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
you have to go and
meet every country

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and understand every culture
so you can understand

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
how the world thinks.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So, to know how God thinks
and to become this God,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
you need to go through the
process of understanding

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
how to become this God
in the different aspects

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:90%
of the constellations.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what we call astrology.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call the
main portals of the galaxy.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.410 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective, we
are seeing these patterns

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
in these four groups of
three constellations.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
This process would show us
the 2,500 years, mostly,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
that each one of
those times were

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
needed to seed the
main codes of the DNA

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:84%
from the other constellations
to this planet.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So, that was the
molding of the eras when

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:84%
humans and other beings, like
Nemnir, like Aessir, like

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Alithir came to this planet.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So they could seed their
own seeds in the Earth.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
needed the energy

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
of these structures of
the portals in the galaxy

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.510 align:middle line:90%
so they could seed that.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The timelines of
these constellations

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.830 align:middle line:84%
would show us the moments
when the Confederation found

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
the doors to build
realities in our world.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is why it's
so important for us

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
to understand the ages, the
times when this was created

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and how the DNA was transformed
through these portals.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:10%
For us, the most
important time of Earth

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:10%
was the one that helps
to organize everything

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:10%
and to put order
into the idea of who

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.420 align:middle line:10%
we were in these constellations
and the Confederation.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
It was the moment when
humanity was able to understand

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.840 align:middle line:90%
their purpose.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:10%
It was the moment when
the people of Earth

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.810 align:middle line:10%
could work hard in
order to put order

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:10%
in every one of those portals
to seek those portals,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:10%
and to make a balance
in between all of them.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:10%
This time was the
period of Virgo,

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:10%
and Virgo was the period of time
when the constellation helped

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.420 align:middle line:10%
the energy of the planet
to create the idea of what

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:10%
we call now Atlantis.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:10%
When Atlantis started, it was
not because just other species

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:10%
decided to create a conscious
society in our planet,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.010 align:middle line:10%
but what happened was that
this planet was receiving

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:10%
the information from God
through the portal of Virgo,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:10%
allowing the humans to be
organized against the chaos

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:10%
that we had before.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:10%
Because of this chaos that
we have with Aessir people,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:10%
we started to organize
a society that

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:10%
allows us to create a
process for humanity

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:10%
to evolve into other
conscious species

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:10%
and to open the portal for
other species to reach God.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:10%
That moment of history
was when other beings

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.330 align:middle line:10%
in the constellations
decided that the Earth was

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:10%
ready to receive the
information of other seeds

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:10%
and that was the moment
when other beings

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:10%
from other constellations
taught humans how was the path

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:10%
to transform itself into God.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:90%
They did it in different ways.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadean people,
in the fifth dimension,

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.860 align:middle line:84%
brought the
holographic structures

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
so we could have in
our energetic patterns

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
all the information
of what we have to do,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
how we can transform ourselves,
and all the information

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
surrounding our
electromagnetic field

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
was able there to
be downloaded when

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:90%
we weren't ready to do that.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians, in the
other hand, they

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
prepare the vibration of
our blood and our cells.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So, that would help us to
reach the amount of vibration

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:49.320 align:middle line:84%
to match with the vibration
of other civilizations.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
The civilizations living
in between the fifth

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth dimension would
have a higher vibration level,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:84%
so they cannot reach
our own pattern.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So, in order to awaken
the pattern of our DNA

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and the codes of
the seeds that they

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
have given to us
through the history,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
they needed us to be in the
same level of vibration.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So, by raising the
level of vibration

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
of our blood and
our cells, they help

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to decode the
information of our DNA

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
so we could reach
the same information

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:90%
from these other levels.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.870 align:middle line:84%
That created the biggest
leap of evolution

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness in the planet,
because Arcturian people

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
helped every human to
rise its information

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and to start listening and
downloaded all the information

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:84%
from the fifth and
the fourth dimension.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
This created a civilization
allowed to reach other portals,

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to reach the fourth dimension,
and to be able to talk

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:90%
with the fifth dimension.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.010 align:middle line:84%
This Atlantean civilization was
prepared also by Sirius people

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%
with the architecture.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:10%
The architecture
taught by them was

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:10%
how to open the portals
around the planet,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:10%
how to spread around
the planet, and how

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:10%
to understand the process of
alchemy in between the stars.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So downloading the
codes of the stars,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to open the
data of these portals of God

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And to do so, we
needed to know how

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.080 align:middle line:84%
to build the temples
in this planet here,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
in the material way,
so the third dimension

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:84%
could download all this
information from other levels.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
What we did in the
Atlantean times

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
was to not only arise the
vibration of our cells, our DNA

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
to reach the information
of the fifth dimension,

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
but also through
the Sirius people,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
to download it in the shape,
in the material shape,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:90%
to create our societies.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:10%
So, for the Arcturian people,
the importance of becoming God

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:10%
was to be able to awake the
potential of every emotion

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:10%
and every pattern
in our DNA that

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:10%
would help us to
download the information

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:10%
of the whole galaxy.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
For the Sirius people, the
goal was not the humans.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
For the Sirius people,
it was the planet.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they
needed to create societies

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that work like ants, like bees,
so they could work all together

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to build the structures
that help download

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
the information from other
levels of consciousness

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:90%
The planet was the goal.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And for the Pleiadean
people, it was the self,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that the
only way they could have

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to reach the
transformation of realities

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
was through the
physical structures

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
that they created in
the third dimension.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So, that is why
they taught us how

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to build the structure
within, through the chakras,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
through the opening of
the portals of each one

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
of the chakras, we would reach
the path towards the self,

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:90%
towards the universe.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:10%
So, both physical civilizations
plus those who were ethereal

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:10%
civilizations they
helped us to understand

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:10%
that we needed to go through
three steps in every time

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:10%
so we could learn about
ourselves in different levels.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:84%
This was taught to
be the correct path

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to illumination and the
correct path towards being God.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:84%
The process they
created was that we

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
needed to download the
information by finding

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
the perfect amount
of vibrational energy

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:90%
in each one of the chakras.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
That would rise the
energetic pattern of the DNA,

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
awakening the codes of
every race and every species

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:90%
that helps us to be who we are.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:10%
And then we can build
outside the structures

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.950 align:middle line:10%
to help the planet to
be aware of itself.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
stories that taught us

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
how to do that, we needed
to see the doors in the sky

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to build the doors from the sky
on Earth and within ourselves.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
When we reach every
timeline in every space,

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
every history would
teach us the process that

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:84%
will take us to reach
the goal to become gods,

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and that is not
something you can

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:90%
do in just one civilization.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You need to go through the
process of 24,000 years,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:84%
approximately, to help
you understand how

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:90%
a human being can become God.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
This process was being
taught through the temples.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean people taught
about these 12 processes

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
through the 12 aspects of
geometry, light, energy,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and sound.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And we all needed to go through
these three parts of our life

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that we call the youth,
the adult, and the oldest.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So these three
processes would be

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
needed to improve the earth,
the water, the fire, and the air

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves
so we could open

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
the portals through the first
species created in the universe

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:84%
by God, even though there
were a lot of beings

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:53.090 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy that didn't want
us to become one of the species

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
testing how to become gods,
because we as humans have

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
so many energy and so many
emotions in ourselves that we

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
can hold in our own life every
spectrum of these 12 phases.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:84%
We can experience the 12
of them in just one life.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is such
an amount of energy

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that for different
species was something

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that made them decide to not
be part of the Confederation

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:84%
if humans would be
taught how to become gods

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and go through the
portals of time and space.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
One of them said to
the Confederation

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
that humans have so much energy
that they would kill anyone

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy if
they would reach

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
a seat in the
Confederation parliament.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So, they wouldn't
accept that humans

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:84%
would evolve as fast as
they were programmed to do.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Sirian people said
we have timelines.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The timelines are
the moments when

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
the Earth goes through each
one of the constellations.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So, we need to teach humans
that they have only 2,400

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:84%
years approximately to
prove themselves in just

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:90%
one of those aspects of God.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So, if you don't
do that, you need

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to wait for another
24,000 years to prove

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:90%
that you do it properly.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So, preparation to be
God, it's like a clock.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand that
there are some times that you

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:90%
cannot do stuff.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see the
sun at 3:00 AM.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So, what they were saying is
if you need to see the sun,

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to wait
until the sunrise.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So, for the galaxy, this process
would take a lot of time,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to
prepare ourselves as humans

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:90%
to be aware of these times.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So, we were trying
to make humans

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to improve so fast that these
other civilizations would say

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
we are not going to support this
project unless they are really

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:10.280 align:middle line:84%
prepared to show how they
are able to be a part of God.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So, other beings saw that
we had so much energy

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.290 align:middle line:84%
that they were harvesting the
energy so they could evolve.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So, for many beings in
the fourth dimension,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
they tried to make this planet
to be in quarantine separated

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:84%
from all the other beings,
so they could eat the energy

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and grow faster in their
own dimensions and worlds.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:84%
We were not only being prepared
to be gods on Earth, goddesses

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, but we
were also the product

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to feed other worlds
and other dimensions.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
In every process of the
constellations in our world,

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
we need to improve ourselves in
each one of the aspects of God.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't reach it,
if we don't do it properly

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
in every one of
those constellations,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
all this energy is stuck in
our bodies and doesn't evolve.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:84%
They just go and turn around
and go back to ourselves.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So, because of this system,
we have created so much energy

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that is not evolving, but
it's just moving around

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that it became like the
main source of energy

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:90%
for the fourth dimension.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to
put a quarantine of time--

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:90%
not space, time.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.200 align:middle line:10%
The quantity of time
represents 40 periods of time

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:10%
in which humans have
to prepare themselves

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.520 align:middle line:10%
in different aspects.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So, they are not allowed to go
outside to the Confederation

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
or to the portals
unless they are

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
ready in each one
of those emotions.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:84%
The process of what
we call quarantine

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
come from the concepts
in Latin of 40 days.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:84%
40 days would be the
right amount of time

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in which you can make a proper
process to understand yourself

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
your own evolution.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So, we have 10 days to
make a process in the body.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Then we have 10 days to make
the process in the soul,

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and 10 days to make the process
in the spirit, the mind.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
When we accomplish
the 30 days, we

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.140 align:middle line:84%
need to go through the
being, and the being

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:84%
would be a day to unify
physical, emotional, and mental

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
aspects of our beings
in just one spot.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So we are balancing and
aligning this process of what

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:90%
we call the human being.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
That brings us 40 days,
40 days to make a process

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.350 align:middle line:84%
to create a new reality
in our physical bodies,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
emotional bodies, mental
bodies, and the energetic body,

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:84%
which is the being in the
electromagnetic force field.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.150 align:middle line:84%
For other species,
this quarantine

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
would mean that we need
to wait for thousands

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.480 align:middle line:84%
of years, the meaning
of one day for them.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So, every civilization,
every culture

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
can go through every
one of those chakras.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:10%
And that is why if we
go back in our history

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:10%
and also in the
future of our history,

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:10%
we will see that every
civilization, that every race,

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:10%
every species, were
trying to reach the goal

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:10%
to balance each
one of the chakras,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:10%
being each country or each
culture or each empire

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:10%
or civilization,
meaning one of those

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:10%
chakras that has to be balanced
through time and space.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:10%
We are now entering in
the time of Aquarius.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:10%
And the time of
Aquarius is the one

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:10%
that is connected with the
self and God by itself.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:10%
So, we have ahead 2,500 years
in which our civilization has

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:10%
to prove that we are able
to be the beings connecting

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.870 align:middle line:10%
the divine from within.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's our goal in
the next civilization.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's for what all our
past times were preparing us.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.900 align:middle line:90%
The time is ending for us.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
The process of the
quarantine is ending,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and we have to prove
to the Confederation

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
if in the next 2,500 years we
are ready to be part of them

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and we can arise the
vibration of our DNA,

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
awaken every potential that they
gave us from the very beginning

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in other ages, and that
we are ready to become

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness and
the neurons of the brain

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.095 align:middle line:90%
that we call planet Earth.

00:26:05.095 --> 00:26:08.382 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.382 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.910 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
the design of human evolution
and explain the quantum leap

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:90%
to Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.890 align:middle line:90%
