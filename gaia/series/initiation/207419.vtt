>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: Who
are the world's agricultors?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide Matias De Stefano.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
how these genetic scientists

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:10%
operate and influence
Earth and human evolution.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The first time I started
to remember the universe,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I was 15 years old.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I felt really, really
tiny because the universe

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:90%
was so big.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't reach
every part of it.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't reach
the shape of it--

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
how long it was, how big it was.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
difficult to understand

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
where to put all the
dimensions, all the stuff, all

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:90%
the matter, vibrations.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything was so big that I
couldn't understand anything.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had headaches every
day trying to understand it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:84%
until one of my guides
from the fifth dimension

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
told me that the only way you
can understand the universe

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
is not by looking up and trying
to understand how it works--

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:84%
the galaxies and
the solar systems.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But the way you can measure
it and understand it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
is with the closest
reality you could have.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's your own body.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So instead of saying,
look into the universe

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
to reach God, he told me, look
at yourself as your own God,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
like holding inside of
you a whole universe.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And as close as you
get to your body,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:84%
you will see every system
working and spinning

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:84%
like galaxies and
clusters and black holes.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And all these structures
that are within you

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
can help you to understand
how everything works.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, for the universe, you
are like an electron spinning

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
around a planet
between the polarity

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:90%
of positive and negative.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that every
electron in your body

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is a person living in different
planets, a being trying

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
to understand and evolve.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:84%
The electrons has no idea what
is the boundary of your body.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:90%
They can't see the boundaries.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:90%
They don't see the organs.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't see the bones.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't see your
eyes, your shape.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
They can only feel
that they are connected

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to other beings around; other
electrons, other protons,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and neutrons and
that they are built

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
by other vibrations
and frequencies that

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:90%
are within them.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand
that you, a person,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:84%
are an electron spinning around
a proton, which is the planet,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
and that structure is building
a molecular structure, which

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
is the solar system, and
then the galaxy is a cell

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and the cell is a part
of an organ, which

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is a cluster of
galaxies, then you

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
can understand that you
were always inside of you.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main idea
of how the universe works.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It takes the tiny
part of the universe

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and just replicates this in
the same shape over and over.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the best way
you can understand

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that you are living in an
organ of the entire system.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you see is
just not stars in the skies.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:84%
They are cells,
organs in this body.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
As everything is just a
reflection from the bigger

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
body to the small body,
we can relate everything

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.630 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So to understand, for
example, our world,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
we can understand that
every part of the planet

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:90%
has organs as we do.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:84%
We have our own
organs, the chakras

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:90%
that make the organs work.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And we also have continents that
are the organs of the planet.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But we can also understand
that the planet is an organ

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:90%
inside the solar system.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:84%
For us, the solar
system is another living

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
being with the pancreas in
the Sun, which is the plexus,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and then all the other chakras
around, like, for example,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Venus and Earth being our uterus
and kidneys of this system.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
we are the sacrum

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:90%
system of this solar system.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We are both working to
create life in this system.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So we are this part
of the body creating

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
the energy so the whole
body could survive,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:84%
could create a new
organ inside the galaxy.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And then Mercury and
Uranus are the mouth

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and the third eye of
the system, so the mind

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:90%
and the voice of the truth.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And then Neptune and
Mars would be the systems

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
to make root in the matter.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So that would be like the
genitals and the root chakra.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the biggest
organ that helps us to exist,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:90%
which is Jupiter.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And Jupiter for us is the heart.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not the Sun.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The Sun is what makes
us recognize who we are.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But the heart of the system
that allows life in our planets

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is the heart chakra,
which is Jupiter.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the crown
chakra of this system

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
but not in the way
of enlightenment.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's the one that helps
us to understand that matter

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
is the one that gives
meaning to everything

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:90%
that is surrounding the system.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
For the body in the
universe, the main core

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:90%
is not the crown chakra.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The crown chakra is
just the one that

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:84%
helps all the ethereal things to
be downloaded into the material

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's why for
the systems, it's

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
the plexus the
core of everything.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Sun is not lighted
in the crown chakra,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.965 align:middle line:84%
it is the plexus that
holds everything together.

00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
When we try to think about the
most important time and moments

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
of human history
on this planet, we

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't think
about what happened

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:90%
with the DNA modification.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
We are not thinking about
aliens coming on this planet.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The main transformation
that we've

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
been through these
thousands of years

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:84%
is something that people
that study history and people

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that know about what happened
in the past would agree.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And that moment was
when the humans,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking for
survival around the planet,

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
they discovered agriculture.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle line:84%
The moment in which
the nomads started

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
to make settlements, when they
created the first villages,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and they designed this way
of harvesting their own food

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.940 align:middle line:84%
was the main moment when
the whole civilization,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of
humanity changed forever.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
The moment of
agriculture-- the moment

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
when humans decided
and discovered

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that when they were
looking into the sky,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:84%
they saw how the plants,
the minerals were attached

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:84%
to this movement through
solstice and equinox,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
they discovered the keys
to make the plants grow.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
by themselves

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the way they can change the
plants, the fruits, the seeds

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
so they could harvest them,
they could storage them,

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and they could
survive through time.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Agriculture is
for a civilization

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
the roots that gives us the
energy, the amount of vibration

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that we need from
the underworld.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:10%
And that connects us with
the power of survivor,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:10%
the power of living in
this planet, the history.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that connects us
to the core of this planet

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:90%
is related to what we eat.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is relating us
with the system of this planet

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:90%
is through our food.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we were able to
control our own food,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:84%
that moment changed
our blood forever.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
That moment changed
our DNA and made humans

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of the
power that they had

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:90%
to transform all the realities.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.030 align:middle line:84%
For every civilization, when
they discover agriculture,

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
it means that we are now
able to understand that we

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:90%
can control everything from us.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
But agriculture is not
something that is only here

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:90%
in this planet.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Agriculture is something that
goes into all the material

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
reality of the third
dimension and that touches

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:84%
everything that creates
energy to feed the being.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
As further you go
in the galaxy, you

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
will need more and more
energy to hold this system.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So for us, every one of us in
our houses, in our villages,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
in our countries would try
to work with agriculture

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to storage all these seeds
to create our own food.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But for those species that reach
to go outside their own planets

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and they start to leave
to inhabit other planets

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and other systems and
even constellations,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:84%
they understood that in order
to bring that energy, to connect

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.480 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of the spirit,
they needed to harvest energy

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
in every planet.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is how the agricultures
of the worlds appear.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
The shape of these
beings were really big,

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:90%
like twice our bodies.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had like a human shape
but with the head of an ant,

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
this head like the
shape of a heart

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and big eyes like ants but
with the mouth of a human.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:10%
They have these
shiny colors that

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:10%
change according
to the rays of sun

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:10%
and bodies were like
the skin of a fish.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And this organization goes
through all other systems

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and galaxies that flies
in this kind of machines

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
with the shape of a lotus, like
many leaves that moves around.

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And they close like a lotus.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:90%
And they open like a lotus.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:10%
And they keep this
information of every species

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:10%
in those chambers
that are like flowers.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And they bring this information
to each one of the planets.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And they bring to the main
storage information in Orion.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They try to seed
every seed of genetics

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:84%
in every conscious planet
in different planets

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:84%
so they could storage
this information

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and not have it
just in one place

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
just in case something happened.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to build these
greenhouses in every world

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
so we could have different
ways to adapt this energy.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.120 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember that for
them, the universe is not

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:90%
called like God.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:90%
It's called the tree.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:10%
We also have in our cultures
these names of the tree

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:10%
of life, the tree of the
universe, the sephirot.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:10%
They are all the codes
to understand how

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:10%
the universe works like a tree.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:10%
And every planet is like
a fruit in this tree.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So for them, God is the
main tree, the white tree.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And this white tree
has many planets that

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:29.240 align:middle line:90%
are the fruits of this tree.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is to harvest
the seeds and stores the seeds

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:84%
in different greenhouses
so they could then

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
look for that
information and take it

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
from this planet and
seed other planets

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
so the information
never is lost.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to be
part of this organization

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.730 align:middle line:84%
when I was living
in a planet close

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
by what is now called
Rigel in Orion's portal.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The constellation of
Orion has a lot of beings.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
organizations that they had

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:90%
were the world's agricultures.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I was part of one of
those species that were

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:90%
working with the agricultures.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And what we used
to do was to seek

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.800 align:middle line:84%
for worlds in
process of evolution

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
so we could say to all
of them where to go

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and which DNAs we have to pick.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So the main agricultors
would bring this information

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
to our planets.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And they would see these
cells, these main materials,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
like in a holographic lab where
they could see the cell so big.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And they could open the
cell in this hologram.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And by vibration with some
tools in their fingers--

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
with vibration, they would
reorganize the patterns

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA so it could be
balanced to the information

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%
of our worlds.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
We did these modifications
to adapt some other species

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:90%
to different planets.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And this worked for us to
create a vast amount of energy

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:90%
in different worlds.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
It's terrible to
think right now how

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the agricultors of the galaxy
used to see the worlds.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But just think about
your own fields

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
when you try to
harvest your own food.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:10%
When you see a carrot,
lettuce, a tomato and then

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:10%
you cut it to eat, do
you think about every one

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:51.800 align:middle line:10%
of the cells of these
vegetables that you are eating?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the question
you have to do

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
to understand how in a bigger
spectrum, in the galaxy,

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:90%
many species work.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:90%
They cannot even see humans.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:90%
They see cells.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:10%
This civilization from
where I was part of,

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:10%
we've been trying to reach
this planets that could be

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:10%
in the work of consciousness.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:10%
So the harvest of
this information

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't be through
the unconscious.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:10%
If all these worlds that
were creating energy

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:10%
were seeded in
unconscious worlds, so

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:10%
worlds that were
dying, these planets

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't be the proper way
to connect with the self,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:10%
with the main source
of the universe.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.920 align:middle line:84%
So that is why we needed to
seek for conscious planets that

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
were trying to reach us a way
to speak with the universe.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
That is why Earth is
one of those places that

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
started to seek for the
mind, for the awareness,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%
for the spirituality.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is why this
planet was chosen

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and humanity was chosen to be
one of the main engines that

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.690 align:middle line:84%
creates these seeds
for these agricultures

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to seed all this amount
of conscience energy

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
around the galaxy.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
During the process
of Orion's war, what

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I remember was a lot of us,
a lot of the agricultors

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
had pointed to Earth saying we
need to bring our information

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and to be ourselves the
storage of this information.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of us--
many of us decided

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to die in these dimensions
and be born in this world.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So from this world,
from being humans,

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
we could harvest our own energy
and teach others how to do so.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The main thing that
many of us were

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to teach in
this humanity was

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
to make the seeds of
every one of our flowers.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in every
main culture in history,

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:84%
the main flowers were every
one of the chakras that

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
were trying to reach
this energy, this nectar,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:90%
feeding the energy of ourselves.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we properly work
with enlightenment

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
of our own flowers
in our body, we

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
would become the seeds to
feed not only other species

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy but also
the whole universe.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Think about your own body.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't eat properly,
you won't think properly.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:90%
You need to eat better.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You need to eat light in
order to reach the mind.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:10%
So the perfect amount
of energy that you

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.710 align:middle line:10%
eat of seeds, fruits,
plants will give you

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:10%
all the energy of the sun
through photosynthesis

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:10%
that, when you eat it, it
will become your blood.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Through your blood, you
will reach the vibration

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that you need in order
to activate every chakra.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you activate
every chakra,

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:18.750 align:middle line:84%
all the system, the
nervous system of your body

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:90%
will work properly.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine that
this process that you

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
have in your own body,
all these cells that you

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.400 align:middle line:84%
eat from other animals,
plants, stones--

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
everything, every mineral,
every vegetable that you eat,

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.630 align:middle line:84%
they would store that
information that you eat.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:90%
And it goes to your system.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:10%
So all this information
from the outer world

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:10%
would feed your inner world.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that those tiny
cells are living beings

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that now are part
of your own body

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.210 align:middle line:84%
that travel through your whole
system through your own galaxy

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and feed with this information
and see this information

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:90%
in your own cells.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Now take that image
from your own body

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and project it to
the whole galaxy.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the galaxy being
a body with millions,

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
billions, thousands of cells
that we call suns and planets.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:10%
And each one of them has tiny
little cells inside of it

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:10%
that creates this energy,
this amount of energy

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:10%
that we need to go
through all the dimensions

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:10%
of this galactic system.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
When you have this idea,
what you could understand

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:84%
is that every species and
every race in our galaxy

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:84%
is related to the cells
of each one of our organs.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So there will be
many species related

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
to the chakras in our
heads and other ones

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:84%
in the chakras of our
heart, the plexus chakra.

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there
would be a lot of them

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:90%
in the chakras below.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
These chakras below are the
ones harvesting the energy

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
so we could use it to empower
the light of the mind.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.630 align:middle line:84%
When you see that
in that way, you

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:22.100 align:middle line:84%
will understand that we are
just cells inside another body.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So we are not being
used by other beings

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
in other dimensions or other
worlds harvesting our energy.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We are creating energy not only
for us but for the whole body.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
If one planet or one system
doesn't feed the whole system,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like one organ in your
body dying or creating cancer.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
If we stop feeding the
whole body of the galaxy,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:90%
then we die too.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So the process that we need to
learn what other species were

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to teach us is how
to create our own strength,

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
how to create our
own center of power.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So that would
connect us with God,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
with the energy of the universe
so we could be eternal.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:90%
We can create our own energy.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the excess of
those energies could

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:90%
feed the rest of the body.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
think about other beings

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
in the galaxy eating our
energy as something bad.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to think in
a biological way.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to think
that we create energy

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:90%
so the body could keep living.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So we are feeding the
galaxy with all this energy

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
of survival, with all
this energy of creation.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:84%
That is why we needed
the agricultures.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:84%
The world's agricultors
were the beings

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that were looking
for this energy

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and opening the portals
of the energy to feed

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.700 align:middle line:90%
the system of the whole body.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:84%
We are the fertile field
for some of these species.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
When I used to see the
worlds in evolution

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and see how we
interpreted the worlds,

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I could understand that
harvesting those worlds

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:84%
was something that helped
us to reach the divine,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:84%
to reach the idea of
what we here call God.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is the same
thing that we have

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.250 align:middle line:90%
to think about our own food.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:84%
If we are what we eat, we
cannot eat something that is

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:90%
in disorder.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
We cannot eat something
that is distortion.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.310 align:middle line:84%
We need to eat it
properly and enlight it

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:84%
so we could feel
that light within.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
the process of many

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of the species that decided
to transform our societies--

00:23:55.850 --> 00:24:01.310 align:middle line:84%
the goal of them was to help
us to enlighten ourselves.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when we come to
be enlightened beings,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we are our own source
of energy and we

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
feed every species in the
universe by consciousness.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, we don't call
that feeding other species.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:90%
We call that unconditional love.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just another word to
say that we are all together,

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that everything
that we do changes

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.200 align:middle line:90%
the reality of the whole system.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So for the agricultors of the
galaxy, what they tried to do

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
was to make the seeds
the better they could,

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:90%
as enlighted they could.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So when anyone in the universe
would eat or receive the energy

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
from those seeds, they would
receive exactly the amount

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of energy and vibration
to enlighten the cells.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I know there are
many people that

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.470 align:middle line:84%
can feel and can know that
there are many beings eating

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.380 align:middle line:90%
our energy in other levels.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth and the fifth
and sixth dimension and even

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension,
there are some beings

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:90%
that are eating us constantly.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And we are generating
all this energy.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
how to handle it.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there
are some other beings

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that they don't want us to
be balanced because they

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:90%
need the low vibration energy.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, a lot of
beings in the galaxy,

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
they need to reach
the main source.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And in order to reach the
main source of the spirit,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
they need to eat properly and
a high level vibration food.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So for us to be
that good food, we

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
need also to create
our own good food.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:84%
We need to be the main
source of our own energy.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
We need to reach the God
and the goddesses within.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And once we do that, we
will generate so much energy

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in harmony that every
being in the universe

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:90%
could just use our energy.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:90%
And we won't even notice that.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's the main
point of being

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:90%
the seed of the whole system.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Being the seed means
that in a tiny body,

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
we have the power to become
the trees of the new universe.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So inside of us, if
we work within us, we

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:84%
can become those trees where
so many beings can live,

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.070 align:middle line:90%
can thrive.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So the goal that
we have here is not

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:84%
to protect ourselves
from those beings.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's to improve ourselves
to become more aware

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of our potential, of who
we are, who we can become,

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, that the only
tool we have to feed everybody

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.665 align:middle line:84%
in balance is
unconditional love.

00:27:06.665 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide Matias De Stefano.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will discover

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.990 align:middle line:84%
how the conflict for
the power of portals

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:90%
became a problem in our galaxy.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:90%
