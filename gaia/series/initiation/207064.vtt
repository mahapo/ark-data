00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.635 align:middle line:84%
>> How are evolutionary
patterns designed?

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I will
describe the creation

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.400 align:middle line:10%
of evolutionary patterns and
how these patterns are held

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:10%
within the divine DNA code.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
When the universe started to
have this consciousness of who

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
it would become, the
main idea that it had

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
was to go out of
itself and to seek

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:90%
for the reflection of itself.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, it
could see itself

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:90%
in different perspectives.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:10%
From the third
dimension, we can think

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:10%
that when we are talking about
an architect or scientists

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:10%
trying to figure out
something, an inventor

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:10%
would create something
outside of him

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:10%
and do something
for others to show,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:10%
to experience, to be lived.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And we think about this mind
like a being creating something

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
outside.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we believe we are
an experiment from other beings

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
in other dimensions,
and we forget usually

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
that we are also those beings.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth dimension,
the perspective

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have from
that reality is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
that the architect, the
inventor of the reality,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
is not doing
something for others.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It's transforming itself
in different levels.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So in the sixth
dimension, you have

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
beings that are meditating
within and transforming

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the patterns that they
have within to switch it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and to show different
realities in which they

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:90%
could be transformed.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So they were not creators that
created us to leave something

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that they hadn't lived before or
that they hadn't proved before.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Every creation is
a part of everyone.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So we humans or every being
that are alive in this planet

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
are just a distortion
or a new creation

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
but within the body
of someone that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:90%
is trying to change itself.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So whatever we
feel and we lived,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
they in the sixth
dimension also lived it,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
because we are part
of their bodies.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there is no
one ruling the creation.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all of us creating
ourselves constantly.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:10%
This means that
in order to create

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:10%
a new reality for these
worlds, those beings

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:10%
in the sixth dimension
has to experience

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:10%
how it is to live that reality,
to experience that reality,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:10%
to prove that it works.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that, it
has to project itself outside.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:10%
So that's why in
the sixth dimension,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:10%
the self has this idea
of projecting itself

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:10%
in many architects of reality
in which every consciousness

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:10%
that he was divided in could
by itself create new realities

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:10%
and project new experiences and
expressions from themselves.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
This created the first
patterns of the universe that

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
are bounded by the
mind of the universe

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
in the five main
structures, which

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
are tetrahedron, octahedron,
the cube, icosahedron,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and dodecahedron.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
They are the basis
of all creation.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And the mix of these five
structures, all the rest

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of the creations in the sixth
dimension could be transformed,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
could be created,
could be expressed.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So from them, they created the
pattern of the flower of life.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And once they had
this pattern what

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
we could see in
the sixth dimension

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
is these spheres of expression
expanding from just one spot.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
This spot was divided in six,
and those six by polarity

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.960 align:middle line:90%
created the 12th.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
These patterns of creation
in the sixth dimension

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
structured the shape of the
sphere for the first time.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And through that shape
of the sphere everything

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
would be created, because all
the potential of everything

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
would be inside of that sphere
that we in the third dimension

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:90%
call a cell.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.540 align:middle line:84%
This cell that has all
this potential within

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
start to divide itself
in many other patterns

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and many other structures,
but all of them

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
were just the reflection or the
distortion of the first five.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.455 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:10%
When the spheres in
the sixth dimension

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:10%
start to split and create
this mitosis of consciousness,

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:10%
the patterns that we could
see of these 12 spheres,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:10%
the six positive and
the six negative,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:10%
were divided and expressed
in many, many ways

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.290 align:middle line:10%
in their actions.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So what we could see of them
was these dots dividing it

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
in positive and negative.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So in this division,
they had a pattern that

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:90%
connect them through vibration.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
This vibration was
connecting the patterns

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
of trinity, which would
be this tetrahedron

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:90%
shape of the network.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And every one of the cells of
this Elohim of these creators

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:84%
was a projection for the
first one from the core

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and connected to the other ones
by vibration in trinity shape.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The first species on being
created in the sixth dimension

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.840 align:middle line:90%
are related to the geometry.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So the tetrahedron is
the species of fire.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
The cube is the
species of earth.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is
a species of air.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And the dodecahedron is
the species of water.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
being, the ethereal beings

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
in the octahedron,
which is the self.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:10%
So all of the others are
bounded by the octahedron,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:10%
the fifth element.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:10%
And this fifth element is
containing the structure

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:10%
of the tetrahedron, the fire,
and the earth, the cube, inside

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:10%
of it.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And then outside, we have
the water and the air.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So the whole network
of consciousness

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
of every being or every species
were created through those four

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:90%
beings, those four structures.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the
patterns of the universe

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:90%
were divided in 12.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
For many, many times
and many, many spaces,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:84%
12 was the number to hold
the structure of the four

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
first realities, the four
first species, and all

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of reality
from the sixth dimension.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We're bounded to
these main structures

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.058 align:middle line:90%
in the sixth dimension.

00:07:50.058 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Before the Big
Bang, this breathing

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
of the universe in
the sixth dimension

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
was creating the most bigger
expression of all the patterns

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in which when it would collapse
through the energy of what

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
we call love, which is
for us gravity here,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
that gravity collapsed itself in
the sixth dimension and created

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
what we call now the Big
Bang and the third dimension.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
So all the patterns being
born in the third dimension

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
are determined by this structure
of the sixth dimension.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's why from every
conscience point in the galaxy

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
or in the universe,
you will always

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
see 12 spots around that will
structure the way you can see

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
the reality and the
main vortex and lines

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
that connects these
dots that are all spread

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:90%
in the systems in the stars.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But they are connected
through this geometry.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So the portals through
the sixth dimension

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
are open to the third
dimension through those portals

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of those stars that we
call now constellations

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
but once we called lines
or spots in the geometry.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The first matrix created was
for us in the sixth dimension.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we
had the third one,

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.810 align:middle line:84%
which is the one we are bounded
to and we are attached to.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So the matrix that we are in
is held by 12 constellations

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.340 align:middle line:90%
surrounding us.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Talking from the
perspective of our planet,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:84%
these 12 constellations are
the ones that hold the matrix.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So this matrix can hold
every purpose, mission,

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and evolutionary design for
the material worlds we are in.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so important
for us for every culture

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:84%
those 12 groups
of stars that are

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:84%
breathing the patterns
from the sixth dimension

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and bringing them to
the third dimension

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:90%
by holding us through gravity.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So there were the water beings,
the Earth beings, the fire

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:84%
beings, and the air beings
that each one of them

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
had a different
pattern of evolution.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But these patterns are specified
by the sixth dimension.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So all the beings in
the fifth, the fourth,

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and the third dimension
are conditioned

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.760 align:middle line:90%
by these forms, these shapes.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
After we go through
the sixth dimension,

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
every pattern is designing
all the evolution way in which

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:90%
we are going to be existing.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So all the patterns
are already designed

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in different levels
of consciousness

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and different
levels of vibration.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So all the path
that we are having

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
now in evolution in
the third dimension

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is already established
by the sixth dimension.

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
transform these realities

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
is through the
vibration you have.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:10%
You can see from
the sixth dimension

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:10%
that you had created thousands
or billions of opportunities

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:10%
to mix those shapes,
those five shapes,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:10%
and to create different
shapes of evolution

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.240 align:middle line:10%
to adapt to every planet.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:84%
But only one of them,
the ethereal one,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
is the one that helps you
to decide in which vibration

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%
are you going to be evolving.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's the octahedron.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is
the self, the being.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So when a species starts
to be aware of it,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
the self activates
the octahedron

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
in the pattern of
the flower of life.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we start to be aware

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are conditioned in
the creation of patterns.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But we can become those
patterns and transform

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.940 align:middle line:90%
our destiny, our reality.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron was
like a diamond.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
This shape was
called the Red Sea

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that creates all the other
structures that we know, like

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the structures of Merkaba,
that start to split

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:90%
and divide by vibration.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.850 align:middle line:10%
And depending of which
vibration we have,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:10%
the rays, the colors,
the light, the shape

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:10%
would be transformed
into different engines

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:10%
to bring the energetical
world and the spiritual world

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:10%
into the physical one.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the beings
in the fourth dimension

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:84%
understood that if we
have all these shapes,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.480 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that helps
us to decide in which shape

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
or which path are
we going to take

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.860 align:middle line:84%
is the vibration we have to
choose one of those paths.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So in the third dimension,
the confederation

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
has the goal to help every
being in this awakening

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to help them
to be a line in the vibration

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
so they could choose the
proper shape to evolve

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.090 align:middle line:90%
through consciousness.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the confederation
cannot modify the structures

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that were already created in the
sixth dimension by ourselves,

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
but they can help us choose
the vibration and to improve

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
the vibration to decide which
one of those patterns are we

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
going to choose
for our evolution.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
All the species living
in the confederation,

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
they had accomplished
an evolution in which

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:90%
they can feel everything.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:90%
They can feel the planet.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:90%
They can be part of the planet.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:10%
And they don't need to harvest
much food or information

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:10%
from the world to be alive.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And they are so bounded to the
fourth and the fifth dimension

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that their magnetical body,
their geometrical body

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:90%
is more wide and more expanded.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the chakras
are more big and also a little

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:90%
bit out of the bodies.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
That made that all the
information flowing around,

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
it's easier to be shared with
other levels of consciousness

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's not held so deep
in the material world.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
sometimes we see them

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:84%
with this big aura or this
big light surrounding them,

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
like if they were angels or in
these spaceships like spheres.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
that we have with them,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
with the people from
the confederation,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:25.383 align:middle line:84%
is that we still need energy
from other beings, a lot

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of energy from other beings.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:90%
That is why we need to eat.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.220 align:middle line:90%
We need to drink.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We need a lot of energy
from our surrounding.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And that makes that the
chakras are more compressed.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
they have more energy

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:90%
and they are not flowing around.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a bomb.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have a
different design in terms

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
of energy that we have
almost the same shape,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but our whole body is
compressed emotionally.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
In this planet, we are
all very compressed

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
in our third
dimensional reality.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So the design we have
here is more determined

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:90%
by the patterns of the galaxy.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the patterns
we have in our lives

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:90%
are more strong.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.735 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main
difference we have with them.

00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
If we go to the first humanity
when we were living in caves,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
we knew that all the patterns
that we have in our existence

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:90%
were written in our hands.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Our culture, our realities,
our way of thinking,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and the main five structures
of the sixth dimension,

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the tetrahedron, the
octahedron, cube, icosahedron,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and dodecahedron, are
printed in our five fingers.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:10%
So that's why to remember
the codes, what we used to do

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.869 align:middle line:10%
is to recognize
that our hands were

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:10%
the first structure,
the first book

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:10%
to tell all our stories
who we really are.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why hands
were the first books

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
to tell the stories
of our origins.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
And from the caves,
we started to do

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.710 align:middle line:84%
the carvings and the carvings
of the patterns of life.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Every pattern of life is not
only a circle from the sun,

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:84%
but also a spiral that
goes through time.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the second
more recognized patterns

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
that we can see in all history
of humanity in every culture

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.570 align:middle line:84%
is circle within a
circle and a spiral.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:84%
These symbols are all over
the world in every culture,

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and you can find
them everywhere.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:90%
And they all mean the same.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:90%
The cycle of life.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
Fibonacci spiral that

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:84%
helps us understand the
mathematics of the creation

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:84%
through the spirals,
through the torus.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
in the past was try

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
to put the images
in two dimensions,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
carving it in the
stones or painting it.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But the patterns were in many
dimensions at the same time.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's so difficult
to understand them in history.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But all these
patterns start to be

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
split in six, the
sign and the flowers,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and then they
connected the flowers,

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.600 align:middle line:84%
creating the flowers
of life that you

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.880 align:middle line:84%
can see in many cultures too
in the mosaics of Greece;

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
in China, in the lines of
China; in Egypt in obsidian.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And all these places has these
patterns of spheres, circles

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and the hands that are the
main structures of reality

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
and that starts
with five rays that

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
also talk about these five
perspectives of reality

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
from the stars.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we recognize these
first stages of information,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
then we see in the sky
that we are related

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to 12 patterns in the stars.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
constellations of the zodiac.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And this structure was
something that every culture

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
in Mayan culture,
in Egyptian culture,

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
in China, in the Celtic
culture, everywhere in the world

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:84%
they settle these 12
constellations that where

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
the patterns that create the
personality of every being.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:10%
If we are trying to
evolve as consciousness,

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:10%
12 is the pattern that
we have to follow.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And that pattern is
everywhere, in the music,

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:90%
in mathematics, in architecture.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have it not only in
science but also in faith.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why we can be bounded
by 12 gods in Egypt, the 12

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.000 align:middle line:90%
apostles of Jesus Christ.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:84%
12, 12, 12 is everywhere
because they today

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
help us to understand
that we are

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the creation of 12 patterns
that are surrounding us

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.160 align:middle line:90%
and hold us through gravity.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We have these 12 perspectives
in time and space.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
We divided the world in
24 hours, but 12 of them

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:90%
in light, 12 of them in night.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So we have 12 darkness, 12
lighted, and in our time

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:84%
we can divide the space and
the time by these patterns too.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:10%
So all day we are a structure
by the reality of these 12

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:10%
patterns.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why in Earth
we were chosen

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
by many beings in
many dimensions

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
because the movement of
our planet, the rhythm

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
that it has in its rotation
makes the perfect place

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to have the 12 phases of
light, the 12 phases of dark

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:90%
in our daily life.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Also we have music.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Music is something that
connects us all all the time.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So music is also whole
by the vibration of sound

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
with the 12 notes, which are
the seven whole notes and then

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
the five half notes.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So every time we
listen into any music,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:20.415 align:middle line:84%
it's like if someone is
playing notes in our bodies.

00:22:20.415 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
To know that there are patterns
that create us all the time

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and that hold our
reality, it will

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
help us to understand
those patterns

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
to improve our evolution
and to improve our time here

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:10%
Because we usually want to feel
this freedom from the matrix.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.420 align:middle line:84%
We want to go
outside this matrix,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and we want to
have this free will

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
to choose whatever
we want to do.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:90%
But this is also a pattern.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:84%
The pattern of looking for
freedom, for free will,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is another pattern that we
all have that helps us improve

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and not to stay
in the same place.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
When we start in the same
system, the pattern of freedom

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:23.940 align:middle line:84%
pushes to transform
ourselves like a worm that

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.470 align:middle line:84%
goes into a cocoon and
from there to a butterfly.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to feel freedom
to transform ourselves.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:90%
So this is also a pattern.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand
that patterns are not

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
something that hold
us but patterns

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:46.240 align:middle line:84%
are tools that we have
to improve ourselves,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
then we can understand that
everything that is around us,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:84%
everything that had created
us and every pattern

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have in
our lives are just

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the tools to seek for
that transformation.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
These patterns, to know
them, to recognize them

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is something that helps us
to understand who we are

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and why we have decided
to be who we are.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
The main patterns that we
have for our personalities

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:84%
are the 12 stars, the 12
constellations that create

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:90%
our personality, our soul.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:32.820 align:middle line:84%
They mold our soul to be who
we need to be in our lives.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.460 align:middle line:84%
All this information are
all the patterns that

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:90%
allows us to be who we are.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:10%
So we have created
those patterns

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:10%
to help us to work better
in our goals in our life.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:90%
So know those patterns.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Recognize those patterns
in all the reality

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
is not to understand
what is surrounding us.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It's to understand
what we have created

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.775 align:middle line:90%
to experience this reality.

00:25:05.775 --> 00:25:09.262 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.262 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.900 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
how time and space portals
are used in the universe.
