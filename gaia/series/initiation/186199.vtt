[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:26.318 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the seed of life?

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.988 align:middle line:84%
And how does it
create this sphere?

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.783 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,
MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:36.495 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will learn
how the planets were created

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.164 align:middle line:84%
and who were the first
beings that created souls.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.677 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago, I was
living in Ruhnilazoh.

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a region in
the north of Egypt.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.474 align:middle line:90%
We call all the region Kem.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:02.896 align:middle line:84%
And the river Nile was
called Tulfa, the great flow.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:09.319 align:middle line:84%
And we have these two regions
that we call the motherland--

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.574 align:middle line:84%
in the north, Ruhnilazoh,
and in the south, Ruhnubah.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Both of them were representative
of the spirit and the body.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Those regions had just one
spot in which both of them

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.004 align:middle line:90%
were connected.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.881 align:middle line:90%
We call this place Haieptul.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:34.011 align:middle line:90%
Haieptul means the tree of life.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:40.225 align:middle line:84%
And that spot was the core of
the soul of the whole river.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.729 align:middle line:84%
This path is today known
as Osireion Temple,

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.817 align:middle line:84%
or Assyrian Temple, which is
behind Abydos Temple in Egypt.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:57.576 align:middle line:84%
This spot there was the core of
the whole system of schooling,

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:01.705 align:middle line:84%
where we were teaching people
and learning from people

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:08.211 align:middle line:84%
the seven laws of the universe
and about every dimension.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:14.051 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea how exactly
give the information to others,

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.385 align:middle line:90%
to new generations.

00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:18.764 align:middle line:84%
So we started to
paint it in walls.

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:23.352 align:middle line:84%
We started to try to understand
the concepts of reality

00:02:23.352 --> 00:02:26.813 align:middle line:84%
through painting our hands,
through painting animals

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
on the walls, and then to
created hieroglyphics effects,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.863 align:middle line:84%
to carve on the stones, and
then to write in a paper

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:38.116 align:middle line:84%
those carvings and
those drawings.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So since 30,000 or 50,000
years ago, we were--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.047 align:middle line:84%
we've learned to understand the
world in a second dimension.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.925 align:middle line:84%
People from the inner
world and other dimensions,

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:58.553 align:middle line:84%
like the fourth, the
fifth, the sixth dimension,

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:02.808 align:middle line:84%
used to give us all the data
from the other dimensions

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:05.477 align:middle line:90%
in a way we could see it better.

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:06.853 align:middle line:90%
And we could understand it.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.773 align:middle line:84%
That's why in many countries,
mostly in England, you

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.944 align:middle line:84%
can see this crop
circles all around that

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:17.614 align:middle line:84%
make this beautiful
drawings in two dimensions.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:21.118 align:middle line:84%
But they are, indeed, in three
dimensions and fourth dimension

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:25.747 align:middle line:84%
moving around and
spinning in spheres.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:30.127 align:middle line:84%
We understood that we were
multidimensional beings.

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:35.841 align:middle line:84%
So we start to teach and to
learn that the information is

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:38.218 align:middle line:84%
not something in
just two dimensions,

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's something in
many other dimensions.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.683 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the whole
information of the universe

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:90%
was explained by architecture.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.148 align:middle line:84%
In our civilization,
they build this monuments

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:54.609 align:middle line:84%
like temples, pyramids that
were not just pyramids.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.194 align:middle line:90%
They were spheres.

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.573 align:middle line:84%
They were the projection of
spheres in the 3D matter.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.871 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are
this octahedron--

00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.249 align:middle line:84%
in one part physical,
in one part ethereal.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So they can create
the fifth dimension

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.297 align:middle line:84%
and the sixth dimension
and in the core

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:18.048 align:middle line:84%
the first one, the
seventh, and the ninth.

00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:21.553 align:middle line:84%
And if you connect every
spot of the pyramid,

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.806 align:middle line:84%
you can have the sphere,
the perfect sphere,

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:29.436 align:middle line:84%
where it connects the
whole sphere of life.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:33.899 align:middle line:84%
So we could go within
the whole sphere.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:37.194 align:middle line:84%
And in the core, with this
darkness of the chambers,

00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:40.572 align:middle line:84%
we could connect with every
dimension just one spot

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.408 align:middle line:90%
and in one moment.

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:48.538 align:middle line:84%
But we knew and we realized
that a lot of people that

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:52.709 align:middle line:90%
were being born into other--

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.045 align:middle line:90%
into a new era--

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.006 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't
understand exactly what

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.425 align:middle line:84%
it meant to be
inside of a sphere

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:02.511 align:middle line:90%
with the shape of a pyramid.

00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:07.557 align:middle line:84%
So we-- my civilization
decided to write it down

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:08.934 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle line:84%
The only way that
other people could

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.731 align:middle line:84%
see the reality we were
seeing in the darkness

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.399 align:middle line:90%
of the chambers--

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.319 align:middle line:84%
they could see it in
paper or in the wall,

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.074 align:middle line:84%
like drawings, where
it was explained.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:28.662 align:middle line:84%
That's why all this information
about every dimension

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:34.751 align:middle line:84%
was carved very deep in
the stones of Haieptul.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:39.798 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we could leave
all this information for those,

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:45.136 align:middle line:84%
who on seeing it, could see
the three-dimensional reality

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%
of everything.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.017 align:middle line:84%
That's why in Osireion,
in this temple,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.271 align:middle line:84%
you can find for the
first time the flower of.

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:59.025 align:middle line:84%
Life the flower of life
is the design multiplied

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:01.653 align:middle line:90%
for many times in this stones.

00:06:01.653 --> 00:06:05.365 align:middle line:84%
So you could see
every dimension of not

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:10.328 align:middle line:84%
just the second dimension,
but from the second dimension.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:16.334 align:middle line:84%
The most important information
that we had at that point

00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:21.881 align:middle line:84%
was the division of cells,
the biology as a way

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:28.513 align:middle line:84%
to bring the spiritual
world to the physical world.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:34.269 align:middle line:84%
Biology is the best way to
understand the meaning of seed

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle line:84%
of life, of the fruit of
life, of the flower of life,

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.108 align:middle line:90%
and the tree of life.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.485 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
you can understand

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.945 align:middle line:90%
the whole information.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way you
can see and experience

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.453 align:middle line:84%
where we were teaching
about every dimension is

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:56.541 align:middle line:84%
the spheres are cells creating
worlds, creating life.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.878 align:middle line:84%
That's why you should
not stay with information

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.297 align:middle line:90%
in two dimensions.

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:04.883 align:middle line:90%
This is not circles.

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.762 align:middle line:84%
Circles just hold us
trapped in one perspective

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.971 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.931 align:middle line:84%
You have to see
this sphere in order

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.893 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
you have freedom

00:07:14.893 --> 00:07:19.356 align:middle line:84%
into many other directions
of time and space.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:23.485 align:middle line:84%
The first physical
realities were just

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:28.156 align:middle line:84%
a projection of this
spheres in vibration

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:33.745 align:middle line:84%
of the soul that were
dividing itself in many, many,

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:38.792 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of parts that
created electrons, protons,

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:43.963 align:middle line:84%
neutrons, molecular beings,
and this realities that

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.175 align:middle line:90%
created the souls as a body.

00:07:47.175 --> 00:07:51.346 align:middle line:84%
We bodies and planets
are just the projection

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:54.891 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of the souls.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.979 align:middle line:84%
We used to say that
the universe was mind.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Everything was mind.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.776 align:middle line:84%
And the mind created
by idea the body.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:08.738 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit could
experience all their dreams.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.325 align:middle line:84%
But they needed a
breach to connect this

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.536 align:middle line:90%
and to create the matter.

00:08:14.536 --> 00:08:17.539 align:middle line:84%
So this bridge was
called the soul.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:20.834 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the core
of every reality.

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It's the breach
in between worlds.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.382 align:middle line:84%
So you need emotion to
understand information.

00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.844 align:middle line:84%
You need energy
to create matter.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:34.847 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the core of
everything, of the tree of life

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:37.600 align:middle line:90%
is exactly the soul.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.231 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is not something
that you can see as a spirit,

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.482 align:middle line:90%
as a ghost.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:48.737 align:middle line:84%
The soul is a sphere,
a sphere, where

00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
every energy and every
vibration of the universe

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.749 align:middle line:84%
is aware and is vibrating
in different levels

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.715 align:middle line:84%
That's why souls are the way
and the bridges to create life.

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:13.303 align:middle line:84%
That's why spheres are the
most important structures

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.764 align:middle line:84%
in which you can understand
the whole consciousness

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:18.558 align:middle line:90%
of universe.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:22.312 align:middle line:84%
In this region that
we now call Egypt,

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:84%
we have these two
circles of life

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.277 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
spiritual one in the north

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:32.113 align:middle line:84%
and the physical one in
the south and the soul

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.325 align:middle line:84%
there in the middle with
the shape of an eye.

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:10%
We know today this shape of the
three realities of the universe

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.457 align:middle line:10%
as the vesica piscis.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:47.378 align:middle line:10%
The vesica is one
circle turning into two,

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.882 align:middle line:10%
created in the middle
like the shape of an eye.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:54.177 align:middle line:84%
This shape of an eye,
the shape of a mouth

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:59.933 align:middle line:84%
is the shape of the universe
that brings up the soul.

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:05.063 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the creation
in between body and spirit.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.315 align:middle line:84%
It is the one that
connects as a bridge.

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:11.236 align:middle line:84%
That's why we used to say
the eyes are the portals

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.196 align:middle line:90%
or the windows to the soul.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's not because the soul
is within and behind the eyes.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.327 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
shape of the eye

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:23.039 align:middle line:84%
was the one that
help us to design

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
our reality in which the
spirit could experience and see

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.088 align:middle line:90%
the body, the matter.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:38.805 align:middle line:84%
We have this vesica like the
symbol to create every reality.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have this circle, like
the sun connecting there

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.147 align:middle line:84%
with the spheres in
the sky, and then

00:10:48.147 --> 00:10:51.442 align:middle line:84%
the other circle that
represents the Earth

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.695 align:middle line:84%
with a cross in the
middle, representing

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.738 align:middle line:90%
the solstice and equinox.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.783 align:middle line:84%
So both of them-- when they
connect in the middle--

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:90%
they create the consciousness.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.829 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
becomes the body

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.415 align:middle line:90%
and the soul in the same spot.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:11.045 align:middle line:84%
So we have this shape that
has the shape of an eye,

00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:14.215 align:middle line:84%
this shape that is the
shape of the mouth,

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:18.303 align:middle line:84%
and also, if you turn it,
the shape of a vagina--

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.889 align:middle line:84%
that is, the creation
of the mother.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.684 align:middle line:84%
This three aspects
of creation start

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:30.607 align:middle line:84%
to design the meaning of
life in every reality,

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.191 align:middle line:90%
in every dimension.

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.945 align:middle line:84%
So this two circles
that start to create

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge about the
Trinity opens the portal

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
towards the creation
of everything

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
through the duality in
between positive and negative.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.835 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:55.006 align:middle line:84%
When the first dimension
started to expand itself,

00:11:55.006 --> 00:11:58.009 align:middle line:84%
it created the first
sphere, the sphere of mind.

00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.802 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
positive and negative

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:04.098 align:middle line:84%
divided itself into
the vesica piscis

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:06.976 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
two mother cells.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have the
seed in the middle.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.359 align:middle line:84%
And from this two dimensions,
we create the third dimension,

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.987 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly the middle
in between both of them,

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:19.447 align:middle line:90%
like two spheres.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:23.117 align:middle line:84%
And then, it divided in four,
which is the fourth dimension,

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:26.371 align:middle line:84%
and then in six,
and then in eight.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So when the whole sphere started
to be created in the universe,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.672 align:middle line:84%
it start to divide in
many other souls, which

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:37.966 align:middle line:90%
is too much energy.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:84%
So this energies that start
to create these branches

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.597 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of life--

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
it was not physical.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.766 align:middle line:90%
It was energetical.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:51.062 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration of it in
other levels of consciousness

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:54.732 align:middle line:84%
in other levels of
dimensions started

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:59.404 align:middle line:84%
to fill all the universe
and all the mind

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:02.156 align:middle line:90%
until it become the distortion.

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:06.577 align:middle line:84%
The distortion is when
every light and every soul

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:10.957 align:middle line:84%
in the universe start to
touch with the other one.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.292 align:middle line:90%
And the colors start to reflect.

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.044 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot see the light.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:18.464 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see the main
light from the core.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.217 align:middle line:84%
So all the rays start
to reflect each other

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:24.971 align:middle line:84%
and create in this mess
and this distortion

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:27.056 align:middle line:90%
that we call darkness.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.767 align:middle line:84%
This distortion of
darkness create, like,

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:35.189 align:middle line:84%
kind of a mirror
shape in which we call

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:90%
the mirror hole of the reality.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.364 align:middle line:84%
So everything is just
reflected in this mirror hole.

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:47.744 align:middle line:84%
And from that, all
the energy that

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:51.789 align:middle line:84%
reach the edges of the
universe and that mirrors

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.333 align:middle line:84%
start to reflect
themselves in waves

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.586 align:middle line:84%
to the core of the
universe again.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:02.133 align:middle line:84%
So all this energy going
out and then coming back

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:06.929 align:middle line:84%
creates such a force and
an energy in the core,

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:10.725 align:middle line:84%
reflecting every
possibility to the center

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:15.146 align:middle line:84%
that this seed start to be
charged with so much energy

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:20.109 align:middle line:84%
that time and space start to
be united and divided again.

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:26.032 align:middle line:84%
So that moment, where
every vibration was divided

00:14:26.032 --> 00:14:30.369 align:middle line:84%
and then all the energy
came back as unity--

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:33.247 align:middle line:84%
and that's the moment,
where everything

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.708 align:middle line:84%
that was created
in the waves start

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.251 align:middle line:90%
to be created in the shapes.

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:40.046 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:14:40.046 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call the Big
Bang, the moment where matter

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.136 align:middle line:90%
was created from the souls.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:51.057 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:84%
When you see the pattern
of the seed of life,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.944 align:middle line:84%
you will see six
spheres and one inside.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:06.531 align:middle line:10%
This six spheres and
one in the middle

00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:11.911 align:middle line:10%
means the seven laws of the
universe, the seven dimensions

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:10%
in which the
reality is organized

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.168 align:middle line:10%
is the core of the
whole information.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:22.463 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
farther and you can

00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:27.301 align:middle line:84%
see beyond the
second dimension, you

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:30.638 align:middle line:84%
will know that the seventh
dimension is just projected

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:32.682 align:middle line:90%
to the eighth dimension behind.

00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:36.894 align:middle line:84%
So you can see this pattern
in eight dimensions.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
When you project
the other one, you

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
will have the information
of the cube, the cube that

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.736 align:middle line:84%
creates the whole realities,
the first cube that

00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:49.991 align:middle line:84%
creates the protector, which
we call the ninth dimension.

00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
In the core of it,
you will have the void

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.414 align:middle line:84%
of the ninth dimension,
where every connection,

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.292 align:middle line:84%
every reality,
every consciousness

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:01.919 align:middle line:90%
holds in the center.

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:06.883 align:middle line:84%
Those spheres we call the
seed, because they are

00:16:06.883 --> 00:16:10.428 align:middle line:90%
the basement of every reality.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:14.223 align:middle line:84%
From these nine
spheres, you start

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:17.977 align:middle line:84%
to create the projection
of other beings

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.313 align:middle line:90%
in other dimensions.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:23.774 align:middle line:84%
You multiply the nine
dimensions that you

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:26.235 align:middle line:90%
can see in the seed of light.

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:32.158 align:middle line:84%
And you multiply it by
2 in the flower of life.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.576 align:middle line:90%
The flower of life--

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:37.371 align:middle line:90%
you will see 18 circles--

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:40.583 align:middle line:90%
9 positive, 9 negative.

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:46.756 align:middle line:84%
The flower, after that, will
create the fruit of life.

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.258 align:middle line:84%
And the fruit of
life will give us

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:51.886 align:middle line:84%
the information of
the first mother

00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
cell of the information of the
whole universe will be alive.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:05.775 align:middle line:84%
This pattern will show you
this 33 levels of consciousness

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.984 align:middle line:90%
that are hold in a sphere.

00:17:07.984 --> 00:17:13.491 align:middle line:84%
So you have every possible
image of every reality

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:17.036 align:middle line:84%
in every dimension
hold in this sphere,

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:21.082 align:middle line:84%
where that is composed by
many other spheres that

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.794 align:middle line:84%
holds cubes and chambers
within each one of them.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:31.425 align:middle line:84%
This fruit of life we call
them, because creation of souls,

00:17:31.425 --> 00:17:34.512 align:middle line:84%
because these spheres
are the ones that

00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:38.057 align:middle line:84%
reflect the light
from inside and start

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:43.354 align:middle line:84%
to spray in different-- to
split in different vibrations

00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:90%
that we see as colors.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:52.405 align:middle line:84%
This fruit of life is the one
that creates the rays of light.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:57.535 align:middle line:84%
So it's the one that creates
for the first time the soul.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:18:00.788 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the whole
energy that the spirit

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:03.374 align:middle line:90%
needs to create matter.

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:07.128 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this fruit
holds the whole energy

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:08.421 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:10.756 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is
the one that have

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.634 align:middle line:90%
all the information to do so.

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:17.388 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment, where also
this spheres in the universe

00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:23.436 align:middle line:84%
start to create the families,
like the clusters of beings

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:26.689 align:middle line:84%
being connected
through time and space.

00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:30.818 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
our spiritual family is

00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:35.156 align:middle line:84%
the moment, where the
energy of the same family

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:38.284 align:middle line:84%
start to split in many,
many, many others,

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:42.413 align:middle line:84%
creating a new body that
we call an archangel,

00:18:42.413 --> 00:18:48.336 align:middle line:84%
seraphim a big being in which
every cell is a new soul,

00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:49.420 align:middle line:90%
creating new bodies.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
We used to give to the
soul a human perspective,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.929 align:middle line:90%
a human emotion.

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:02.808 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we project
the image of a soul,

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:05.353 align:middle line:84%
like if they were
people with head,

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:08.564 align:middle line:84%
with hands, with
feet, with eyes.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:11.567 align:middle line:90%
But the souls are not that.

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.444 align:middle line:84%
That's only a
projection of ourselves

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.904 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:20.159 align:middle line:84%
But-- what we call
ghosts or spirits--

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.829 align:middle line:90%
but soul doesn't have a shape.

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:25.873 align:middle line:90%
The souls are energy.

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:28.376 align:middle line:84%
You could maybe
see like a rainbow

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:35.341 align:middle line:84%
or see like spheres projecting
light and projecting shapes

00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:42.223 align:middle line:84%
of geometry around, but without
specifical eyes, mouth, ears,

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:44.308 align:middle line:90%
and human shape.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The first souls
created were just

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:52.358 align:middle line:84%
the vibrations being born from
the sounds of the universe.

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:58.155 align:middle line:84%
So the seven first vibrations
were the seven first rays

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:01.075 align:middle line:84%
and colors of the
universe that started

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:06.372 align:middle line:84%
to be themselves projected
to every time and space.

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:11.085 align:middle line:84%
And that's why every
soul first created

00:20:11.085 --> 00:20:14.964 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, where
all the energies like

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:17.633 align:middle line:90%
in expansion as a sphere--

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:21.178 align:middle line:84%
so when they started
to mix together

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.305 align:middle line:84%
and they started
to cross and create

00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:31.897 align:middle line:84%
this great sphere of life
that we call the seed of life,

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
we have this soul as
beings, energetical beings

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.158 align:middle line:84%
without any shape
but the sphere.

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.952 align:middle line:84%
After that, when
each one of them

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:50.499 align:middle line:84%
start to split into many others,
we start to call them seraphim.

00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:53.836 align:middle line:84%
A seraphim could have
the shape of a sun,

00:20:53.836 --> 00:20:55.963 align:middle line:84%
could have the
shape of a galaxy.

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:59.800 align:middle line:84%
They're such a big
beings that they can only

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.386 align:middle line:90%
express themselves in spheres.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:05.014 align:middle line:84%
Spheres, or spirals,
in the universe

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.141 align:middle line:84%
are the shapes of
the first souls,

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:10.561 align:middle line:84%
because it's the movement of
the energy of the universe.

00:21:10.561 --> 00:21:15.232 align:middle line:84%
Every being that you
have seen as colors

00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:19.528 align:middle line:84%
around going through
the shape of a spiral

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:24.116 align:middle line:84%
or the shape of a galaxy, the
shape of a sun, of a planet

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:28.287 align:middle line:84%
is part of the cells that
divided this big being

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:33.959 align:middle line:84%
called seraphims, which are the
biggest beings in the universe.

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:39.757 align:middle line:84%
From there, the planets were
born, from those first soul

00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:41.759 align:middle line:90%
that have these shapes.

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:45.095 align:middle line:84%
After that, through
the division of matter,

00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
through the creation of cells,
the structures of the souls

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.852 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of
the souls start

00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:59.693 align:middle line:84%
to look for new perspectives of
life in which the cells tried

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:04.532 align:middle line:84%
to divide themselves in
order to the gravity in time

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:06.534 align:middle line:90%
and space of each planet.

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:09.912 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we started
to have many other shapes,

00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:84%
like different spheres divided
into different realities.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.212 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
these shape of humans.

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not because we are
similar to God or the angels.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.472 align:middle line:84%
We just projected
our shapes to them.

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:33.602 align:middle line:84%
But they projected their
shapes to us as cells.

00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:38.232 align:middle line:84%
That's why the only reality that
exists is not our human shape.

00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:41.527 align:middle line:84%
The only reality that
exists is the spheres

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:45.906 align:middle line:84%
that created the proton,
neutrons, the cells.

00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:48.242 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
reality that exists.

00:22:48.242 --> 00:22:52.121 align:middle line:84%
The rest is just a
conjunction of gravity

00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:56.333 align:middle line:84%
shaping these spheres
towards evolution.

00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:57.751 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:01.797 align:middle line:84%
After seraphims were created
from these vibrations

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:08.679 align:middle line:84%
of spheres of souls, this new
separations of the seraphims

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:13.475 align:middle line:84%
created the power and the
most powerful energy that

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.811 align:middle line:90%
has a purpose in a creation.

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
This power of cannons
in the universe

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.234 align:middle line:90%
were called it archangels.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:26.697 align:middle line:84%
Archangels are not
human shaped, but are

00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:30.159 align:middle line:84%
like a projection of
those seraphims creating

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:35.164 align:middle line:84%
solar systems, creating patterns
of geometry that condition

00:23:35.164 --> 00:23:37.791 align:middle line:90%
the beings into evolution.

00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's why a lot of people--

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:44.715 align:middle line:84%
we can say we come from the
energy of one archangel.

00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we are the
purpose of experience of one

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:54.933 align:middle line:84%
of the most strength forces of
each one of those seraphims.

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:59.313 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of a tree in
which the ninth dimension,

00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:02.191 align:middle line:84%
the first dimension,
the seventh dimension

00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:90%
is the main part of the tree.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.864 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have these
branches that we call seraphims

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:12.284 align:middle line:84%
and then, other branches
coming from those that we call

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:90%
archangels.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.373 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have many other
branches called angels.

00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:19.416 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have
the leaves that we

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:23.379 align:middle line:90%
call beings alive in planets.

00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:31.345 align:middle line:84%
So we are all just one spheres
split in many other spheres

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:33.806 align:middle line:84%
that creates this
tree of life, that

00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:90%
creates this fruit of life.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.771 align:middle line:84%
So we are the
smallest spheres that

00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:44.817 align:middle line:84%
were created from archangels,
angels, seraphims,

00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.444 align:middle line:84%
and the great spheres
of the tree of life.

00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:49.738 align:middle line:90%

00:24:49.738 --> 00:24:51.949 align:middle line:84%
It's important for
you to understand

00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:55.619 align:middle line:84%
what means the seed of
life, the fruit of life,

00:24:55.619 --> 00:25:01.291 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life, because you
are that, because within you,

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
every sphere that you call cell
is creating the body that you

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.093 align:middle line:84%
are in and holds the information
from the whole universe

00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:13.929 align:middle line:84%
in every dimension
possible created.

00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:19.184 align:middle line:84%
So to understand the
shape of this structure

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:25.482 align:middle line:84%
helps you to understand
how you all were created

00:25:25.482 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and how you can
transform yourself.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:32.865 align:middle line:84%
When you recognize the power of
the cell, the power of the DNA,

00:25:32.865 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
the power of the
atom, inside of you,

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:42.791 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize that the
symbols that you have seen

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual way, in
the history as the seed

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.757 align:middle line:84%
or the flower of life
is not just a symbol.

00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:51.633 align:middle line:90%
It's biology.

00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:56.263 align:middle line:84%
You are in shape
all this flowers

00:25:56.263 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and all this dimensions
being experienced

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.478 align:middle line:84%
in the three-dimensional
reality.

I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as De Stefano,

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:14.656 align:middle line:84%
for this series on the
creation of the universe.

00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.742 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:19.578 align:middle line:84%
we dive into how
spiritual beings become

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:23.332 align:middle line:84%
intelligent species, and the
conflicts that came from that.
