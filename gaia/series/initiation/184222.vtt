00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the matrix,
or the network?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.765 align:middle line:10%
I am your host,
MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I am going to
explain why the matrix exists

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:10%
and how it was created.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
As we were talking about
the first dimension

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and how everything comes from
the mind and the mentalism,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
we could see that every other
reality that was created

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
was just expansion of
just this one reality.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The first dimension is the
one that holds every others.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And the other dimension
that we can tell

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:90%
holds every other reality--

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
it would be the
eighth dimension.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Eighth dimension
is this dimension

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
where you can see
everything, where

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
you can contemplate
the first dimension

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:90%
in every possible way.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
As the first dimension tried to
express in itself in duality,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in trinity, in the fourth
dimension with the statements

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth dimension, and
every part of the reality

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
start to split in
many, many concepts

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
in different times
and different spaces.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The eighth dimension-- you
can see everything just

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:90%
from one spot.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:84%
As you can see from
the first dimension

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are everything and
that you project everything,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the eighth dimension would have
the information of everything,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
of every second, of
every millions of years,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
in every perspective
of the universe.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So you can see it almost
like a shape of a torus

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
going around and spinning
with many, many, many circles,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%
going around.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And every circle will create,
like, the shape of an apple.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And this apple-- it will shows
you that every frame of time

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and space that you can
see from this torus--

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
it will be a part of the
reality of every being living

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:90%
their lives.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:10%
I was explaining that
in fourth dimension,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:10%
you could see the four
pillars of reality

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:10%
and that you have to go through
expression, experimentation,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:10%
integration, and transcendence.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:10%
And every time you have done
the circle, the four statements,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:10%
the four pillars start to move a
little bit in order to show you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:10%
different perspectives.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:10%
So you can create different
lives and different perceptions

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:10%
of the same issue.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So once you have accomplished
every part of this awareness

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of yourself in many,
many lives, you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
have done the whole wheel
of life, the samsara,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:90%
doing the karma dharma wheel.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you have
accomplished the whole process

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.780 align:middle line:84%
of your soul and your--
with many, many bodies.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But in the eighth
dimension, it disappears,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
because the reality is not
just a wheel of many lives

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
in many times and spaces.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
It start to be
different beings around,

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
creating this sphere
and the tree of life.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The eighth dimension you
could see like a big tree.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
We call it the white tree,
the tree with this roots

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
that touch the branches,
evolve, and makes

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
this sphere with many, many
branches and dimensions around.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And every leaf is like a
world or a being living

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
This tree of life is the
reality that we call the matrix.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
The matrix is a web, a
network of connections

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:90%
that it's similar to our brain.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Our brain works also
with two parts--

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:90%
one creative, one logical.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So in this two parts
of the universe,

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
you have all these
synapses going

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
on that connects the
whole information

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
of the whole universe from
the past, the present,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
and the future.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The eighth dimension
is the one that

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
connects the whole
thinking of the universe

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:84%
in different levels of
consciousness, not only mind,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
as in the first dimension, but
also emotional and physical.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.150 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call the eighth
dimension the Akashic records.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And also, we call the eighth
dimension the matrix in which

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:90%
we are all in.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.040 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of the
internet of God.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
The eighth dimension
is the place,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
where you have every program
in, every app, every Wi-Fi,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:90%
every signal.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you will need
is in the eighth dimension.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you are
trying to change yourself

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
or to integrate yourself, you
can just download information

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
from other levels
to your own body.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
All this information is there
waiting for you to be aware

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and in the same resonance to
bring that information to you.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So the network is
this womb of creation,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.842 align:middle line:84%
of thinking that we call the
network of consciousness.

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The network of
consciousness is something

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:84%
that goes through the whole
universe and connects us all,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:84%
connects every
consciousness in the world

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:90%
in every world in every galaxy.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why in its
conjunction, we used

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:90%
to call it the subconscious.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the conscience
that holds us all.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And that condition us all why we
are not conscious of ourselves.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:84%
If we realized that
we, as human beings,

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
are not just beings
above a planet,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
but we are also beings
part of the planet.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
We are also beings part
of the solar system.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:10%
We are also beings with wisdom
and conscience from the galaxy.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Until we'd see that
as a symbiotic being

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
around the universe--
so we are not

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to get in
touch with the eighth dimension.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And that will download
all the information

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that we possibly can imagine
from every time, every space

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in every part of the universe
and even every other universe

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.130 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a lot of people
talking about the matrix

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
as something negative, as
something that you cannot

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
escape, that is like a jail
or a cage, where you are in.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
process of evolution

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is to see how can
you escape matrix.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:90%
But this is not like that.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a thinking that maybe
was born in this planet, where

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
all beings felt that we were
trapped, because we were not

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:90%
taught about freedom.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is not going
away from something.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is being responsible
of your own reality.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Freedom is when you have the
power to decide for yourself,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
not the power to escape
from other reality.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
this planet we don't

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
understand that matrix
is not a cage, where

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:90%
you have to escape from.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:90%
It's indeed the consciousness--

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness and
subconscious of your reality.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to
escape the subconscious.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible, because it
holds everything that you are.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious is not
something under something.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It's surrounding you.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Subconscious is all this.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:90%
In conscience is here.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And the conscience is
the seed of this fruit.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious
and the unconscious

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
is feeding with
energy the conscience.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So the network, the
eighth dimension,

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
is the place that feeds
you with consciousness,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
is the place that gives
you the information that

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:84%
allows every being to be
connected to every dimension

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and allows every
being to be connected

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to every other being in
different worlds, dimensions,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
emotions, physical planets,
the consciousness of God.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything is connected
in the matrix.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
The matrix is you.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:90%
You are part of the matrix.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:10%
If we think that we are a
leaf or a flower in a tree

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:10%
and because we are
a leaf or a flower,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:10%
we are trapped in
the tree, it is

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.400 align:middle line:10%
because we didn't understand
that the flower and the leaf

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:10%
are the product of the tree.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And they are the tree indeed.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:90%
They are not something separate.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
They are not something
that is trying

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.130 align:middle line:90%
to go away from the tree.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They are trying
to feed the tree.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
With every experience,
with every breath,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:90%
you are feeding the network.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic records
is like this library,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
where every book that
haven't been written yet

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and every book that was
written shares information

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is coming
and everything that has come

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
co-exist in this tree
of life, in this reality

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
eighth dimension.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.470 align:middle line:84%
All the information of the
eighth dimension is around.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you try to
escape from the tree,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
it's like if at a leaf
or a fruit of the tree

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:84%
falls down to the floor, but
you will realize something

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
when you fell down to the
floor, that you will be,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
again, food for the same tree.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you have become
a fruit by yourself

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize
yourself, then have

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the seed within that you
are the universe itself.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:90%
So you become a fruit.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And that fruit falls
down from the tree

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:90%
and creates a new tree.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But you will realize
that new tree is

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same as the old
one, but with new experiences.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So the matrix is like the womb
of a mother that you cannot

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:90%
escape.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
You can be born
from your mother.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:90%
But you will die.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And she will still
be your mother.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
The mother is the one
that holds and creates

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.000 align:middle line:84%
our energy, body, and mind
from the very beginning.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So matrix must not
be seen as something

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:90%
you have to escape from.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to see it
as a mother that

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is trying to help you to
create your own world.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the ancients way
to understand the matrix

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and information that
is there is a story

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of Adam and Eve.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
They used to call in
Christianism, a tree of life

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
with apples that has all
the information and wisdom

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But it was prohibited for
humans to eat those fruits,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
because we were not
ready to understand

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:90%
what those fruits mean.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The story tells about
this man and this woman

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to create
a new world, a new reality.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there
is a snake that

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:84%
tells them there
is a tree there,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
where you can find the whole
information about how to do it.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's prohibited for you.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be ready to
understand how to do it.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:84%
This snake-- we used
to call it the devil.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:90%
But the snake is not the devil.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
The snake is the doubt and
the path of illumination.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.530 align:middle line:90%
The snake means the Kundalini.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the process
in which the being

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
has to go up to look for the
fruit in the tree of life.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through
the Kundalini, the energy

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
of the snake, the light
snake around your body

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
to work in every
one of your chakras

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
to be aligned in order
to get that fruit of life

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.800 align:middle line:84%
instead of being prepared in
every chakra, in every path

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:90%
and work itself.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
In order to be aligned to become
a fruit in the tree of life,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
the humans tried to
eat the fruit of life

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and take the
information from others

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that have done the job to
work themselves to the light.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So the tree of life is
the key of the universe.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It's how the eighth
dimension exists.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole beings
and the whole information

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Just combine it in
this eighth dimension.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:84%
In this tree, you have a
lot of minerals in the roots

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of leaves
in the branches.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Every leaf is a living
being in the universe.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
These leaves and these flowers
that are the enlightened ones

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
can help others to become
better, to become flowers,

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.380 align:middle line:90%
to become lift.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And some of them,
to do so, they have

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to die in this reality to go
to the roots and the minerals

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to look for that information and
bring those minerals up again.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why beings from the fifth
dimension, fourth dimension,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
sixth dimension usually
die in those dimensions

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to be born in these
dark dimensions,

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
like the third one
and the fourth one.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
These dimensions are
the roots of the tree.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So the ones that are
considered the flowers

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and the leaves, which
lives in the fifth

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:90%
and the sixth dimension--

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
they must come down and
bring that information again.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And they will feed the whole
tree of life once and again

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
until some of them, some
enlightened ones, the ones that

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.590 align:middle line:84%
recognize that the whole
process is just one being

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to create new
beings around itself--

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
they recognize that are able to
create their own tree of life.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some
flowers become fruit.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Fruit is when they got
the whole information.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And they started to create
the whole information within.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%
They understood the
laws of the universe.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And they become creators
of their own realities.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
They recognize that they
are the seeds of life.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
created this fruit

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
around them, which
are the dharma and all

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.570 align:middle line:84%
this information,
the new information

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.220 align:middle line:90%
of their own experience.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.250 align:middle line:84%
They enlighted, and then
transcend enlightenment

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
to become a fruit in self.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment,
the fruit goes down

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and start to feed not
only the old tree,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:84%
but the new tree you become,
your own tree of life,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%
your own universe.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But this new universe will be
the same one as the latest,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
because you are the same
species of the tree.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
You are the same universe, but
split in many other universe.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So each one of those
fruits are like books

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that holds a new
information of who we could be.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
teaching of this story

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is, don't eat the
information of others.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Just look into the
information of others.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But build your own
information, your own truth,

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:90%
because the universe has done--

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:56.690 align:middle line:84%
has give us the gift to
become ourselves a universe.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the information
from other universe

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:84%
instead of creating
your own universe--

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
so you will be eating the
fruit of that tree of life.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And your own reality
will disappear

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and will be destroyed
by the information that

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:90%
is not your vibration.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why in the story,
when Eve eats the apple,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
the whole story for them is
destroyed, because she was not

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:84%
building their own
information, and he neither

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
were building their
own information.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
They were just living so
quiet and peacefully that they

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
didn't do the work
for themselves

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:90%
to build their own tree of life.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult
to be eighth dimension

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
here on the third one,
because the eighth dimension

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:90%
implies to be--

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to feel-- to be aware of
every timeline and every space

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's the
biggest consciousness.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to understand
every information that you

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.810 align:middle line:90%
have in the internet.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.610 align:middle line:90%
It's almost impossible.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's not necessary to
have all this information.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessary
to look for it.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.950 align:middle line:84%
What you just have
to do is to be

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
open to receive the
information that

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
is in your same
level of vibration,

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to be open to all this new
information that is surrounding

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
you and be aware
that you are part

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
of the universe.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.780 align:middle line:84%
When I explain about
the eighth dimension

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and the Akashic records,
I used to explain it

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
like if it were a library
or kind of a Wikipedia,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
where you can go and look
for any information you want.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But for the eighth
dimension, when

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
you realize that every
dimension is just

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
a perspective of
reality, you will

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
realize that the
eighth dimension is not

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
a place, where you have to go
to look for that information,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
but you have to become
in order to see and feel

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is the difference
between the people that

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get into
the Akashic records

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:84%
to look for information
and the people that

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.800 align:middle line:90%
is willing to transform itself.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The differences are
that some people

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
is going to the eighth
dimension, to the network,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
to the matrix to look
for that information.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And they touch the
information outside their own.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And they put their vibration
and rhythm to that information

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
they touched, because they
touched this information.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So this information, pure in
another part of the universe,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
has to be at the same level of
frequency of the person that

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
is reading it.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:90%
So it could be written.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So you change the perspective
of that information outside you.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And then, you go back.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.280 align:middle line:84%
You explain that
information to other ones.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:90%
But that there changed.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So that information
there now is confused

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:84%
for those other beings that used
to go and pick up information

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:90%
from there.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So when you go outside
to look information

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:84%
from your vibration,
you can do a mess

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:84%
into the network that is
connecting ever being around.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can download
that information is not

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
going there and look for
it, but to be yourself.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Transform into the vibration
of that information.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:90%
So you can download it.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the good way of doing it.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't go and look
for the information.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Just put yourself in the
level of that information.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:90%
So it could be download to you.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
need to be prepared

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.595 align:middle line:90%
to get in the eighth dimension.

00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
We cannot go from the third
dimension to the eighth

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:90%
dimension like if it was a trip.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to be prepared inside
our bodies to be aligned

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and to be centered
in every chakra,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:90%
in every part of our being.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
So we could download information
from the eighth dimension.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
In 2024 and 2026, it
would be a lot of--

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:84%
a big download of information in
this planet for new societies,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:90%
for the new era.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't prepare ourself
in between 2020 and 2022,

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:84%
for example, we are not
going to be able to be--

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.470 align:middle line:84%
to transform ourselves
into that information.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.510 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we need to
be ready in our chakras,

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:10%
ready in our
bodies, in our soul,

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:10%
in our mind to be wide open
to receive that information.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it will
be just like a rain,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
where the water is
just going away.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
To receive that
information, to be

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
open to the eighth
dimension and the torus that

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to transform
ourselves in the next years

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and the next centuries,
we need to be

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
aligned to the network
of the eighth dimension.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is why a
lot of people now

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
is talking about the
reconstruction of the torus,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.950 align:middle line:84%
the information of the
torus, and how it works,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and how it creates
matter, because it's

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
the only way we
can understand how

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
we are going to be able
to transform ourselves

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.740 align:middle line:90%
in fruits of life.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
