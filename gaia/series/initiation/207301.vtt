>>MATIAS DE STEFANO: Why is the
use of trinity in the portals

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:84%
important to unite the
body, soul, and spirit?

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide Matias De Stefano.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:10%
In this episode,
we will describe

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
how the trinities of
the zodiac are connected

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:10%
and why that's important for
the evolution of consciousness.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:84%
From Earth perspectives, we try
to understand the realities.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Like if everything
that exists, we

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:90%
are shaping it through our mind.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
That every constellation
is just an idea

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
of our culture, our
evolution, our way

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:90%
of seeing the realities.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's not
precisely like that.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
We are just the mirror, the
reflection of something that

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:90%
creates everything from behind.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So we understand the world not
just because of our culture,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
because we are the
reflection of some truth that

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:90%
is behind the realities.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So we are trying to
understand something

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:90%
that is already within us.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So to understand this, we can
imagine that we humans are here

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%
in this spot.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
like a veil where

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
all the stars and
all the realities,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
everything that we see and
we project is in the middle.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the other side,
we have this light that

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
is projecting this reality.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And that makes us see what
we are seeing in the outside.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So if we see it
as a line, we will

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:84%
think that there is someone from
behind the scene trying to show

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:90%
a reality and project it to us.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:90%
But everything is a circle.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So if everything
is a circle, it's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
us projecting ourselves
through behind our own reality.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So the same spot that
is projecting everything

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is this same spirit that
is observing the reality.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
This means that we are the
last projection of reality that

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:84%
projects itself in different
realities once and again

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:90%
once and again.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
We are not here
observing the stars.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:90%
We are the stars on Earth.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
We are the material
form of the light.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And the light itself
is a material shape

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:90%
from the mind of the spirit.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So we are the mind
in flesh and blood.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
This means that the universe
is built by three spectrums--

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
the one that is projecting
through the mind,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
the one that creates
the ideas and the lights

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
and the energy in
order to be seen,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and the one that is
projected and that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
lives physically everything that
was projected through the mind.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:84%
We call that the spirit,
the soul, and the body.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
But they are not three
different things.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
They are just three different
processes from just one only

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just one being being
born, growing, and then dying.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just the same
spirit, the same energy

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that goes through
time, experiencing

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.040 align:middle line:90%
different aspects of itself.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So the process of reality to
create a mind, an emotion,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and a body to live the
emotion and the mind

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
would be the same
process that we

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
have to reach in
order to understand

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:90%
that we are our own creators.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:10%
So that is why if the
spirit creates a portal,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:10%
the soul creates
the constellation--

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:10%
the idea of this portal of
information-- on the body,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:10%
see the stars, the planets,
and the realms of reality--

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:10%
so in order to get
again to the spirit,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:10%
the humans, the
conscious beings,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:10%
has to put those
energies, again,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:10%
into the realms and the
suns, and the planets,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:10%
and everything, and the
stars, the constellations

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:10%
so we could understand the
main concepts and ideas that

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:10%
made them being created, the
emotions that that creation

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:10%
moves so they could understand
the concept behind of that

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:10%
so they could reach the spirit.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
process of trinity.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The process of trinity is
the vibration creating energy

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:90%
in order to create matter.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the matter
trying to understand

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the energy so it can rule the
vibration, the spiritual world.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:90%
This is created in trinities.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The trinities of
reality, the process

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
in which the spirit
and the body are

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
bounded in the evolutionary
path through all these realities

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:84%
that are creating
us constantly, this

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:84%
was a project created
in the sixth dimension

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:90%
through the geometry.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So that is why
it's easier for us

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to understand these processes
through the triangles

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:90%
of these 12 aspects of the self.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
In every galaxy, we
have these 12 aspects.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:90%
But they move.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And they transform itself.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Like here on Earth,
our own lives

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.545 align:middle line:90%
are transformed every time.

00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the theory
of the continents

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%
moving around the planet.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Through millions of years, the
continents started to split,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to move, and to transform the
coast, mountains, sea, deserts.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So in billions of
years, the planet

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
was shaping the shapes
of the continents.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So we now can understand that
we have seven continents, five

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:90%
biggest oceans.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And we can name them.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But through the time,
they were only one.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:10%
The unity of them was
Pangaea and the unity

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:10%
of the water Panthalassa.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:10%
And these two concepts, the
positive and the negative,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:10%
is exactly the same as we
understand the universe.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Then this universe from
positive and negative,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the water and earth, start
to split in many others.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So the continents needed
thousands of years

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to appear to create the
shapes that we know today.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So the same happened
in the galaxy.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Thousands and billions
and eons of time

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
needed to create the shapes that
we now understand like the 12

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
constellations.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
So through time, the
stars were moving.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The arms of the
galaxy were moving.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So the evolution of
how we understand

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the divine in the universe
also was evolving.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.610 align:middle line:84%
When we have only one star,
we can relate with God.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But when we can see thousands
and billions of stars

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
that are gathering in
groups that connects

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
with the main ideas of
God, what we can see

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
is that we have many
aspects to cover in order

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
to understand the self.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, in our planet, we
have only one sun and only one

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:90%
moon.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:10%
And that creates also a
duality for our beings.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:10%
This is not like
that in every planet.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:10%
For example, in Sirius,
we have two suns.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:10%
And at the moment one
of them was setting,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:10%
the other one was rising.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:10%
So we kind of had a lot of
light during the whole time.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And we had five
moons that reflected

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:10%
the light of those suns.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:10%
So we kind of have not
much time of darkness.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:10%
And that made us to
understand that we don't need

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:10%
this perspective of duality.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the beings
evolving those planets

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
are aware of a lot of
things that we are not

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
because we need to go to
sleep and we need to wake up.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Those beings that
are aware of how

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to bring the sun during the
whole period of spinning

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of its planet had evolved in
order to be aware constantly

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have the concepts
of a group that represents

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:90%
the dark and the light.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So that is why many
of those beings

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
can't understand our way
of seeing the reality

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:90%
between light and darkness.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
This explains how
every planet has

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
a different perspective from
the 12 aspects of the divine.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
That is why when a conscious
planet can see the stars

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and can reach these 12
aspects, we from here

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
understand that every
realm that exists in animal

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
kingdoms, in vegetal
kingdoms, in mineral kingdoms,

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
and human kingdoms
are like the structure

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in which the spirit created the
ideas in the physical matter.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So that is why we put the images
from the humans, the animals,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and the minerals into the sky so
we could understand and relate

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:84%
these processes that
we are living on Earth

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
but to understand the
concepts that the divine has

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:84%
used in order to
project our realities.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The stars that
vibrate so far away

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
just connect their energy
through the different levels

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:90%
of vibration.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So until the light reaches
and touches and transforms us,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
the main structure are
all the strings that

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.590 align:middle line:90%
connect all these realities.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And that vibration,
whatever happened there

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
or whatever happens here,
just transform our perspective

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:90%
of those stars.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So when we spin,
our planet spins,

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
we can see the time in
12 different aspects.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we
divided the time in 12.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We divided the time in 12 parts
of day, 12 parts of night,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:90%
and the 12 parts of the year.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
For many ancient beings, we had
two calendars-- the calendar

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that was talking about
the sun and the calendar

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:90%
talking about the moon.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The one talking
about the sun would

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:84%
relate every energy of our days
with the 12 constellations.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And the calendar
of the moon would

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.460 align:middle line:84%
talk about the process of
creation in this world.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:90%
So it wouldn't be 12.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:90%
It would be 13.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
It would be 13
because we have 13

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:90%
cycles of the moon in the year.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So all the process in our
planet because we are water

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:90%
is bounded by the moon.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the best calendar
to use for us to understand

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the relationship with the
spirit is the moon because we

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:90%
are part of the body of water.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the ancient
cultures used to use the moon.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Also, that gave the power to the
feminine aspect of this world

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
because 13 months,
28 days-- each one

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
was related with
a period of women.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So in every month, we
could create a new life.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So we knew that while the
moon with the cycle of 13

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:84%
were trying to improve
our blood in our bodies'

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
physical structure,
the sun calendar

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
would helps us to understand the
cycle of our spirits and souls.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So the body was ruled by
the moon and our spirits

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:90%
by the sun.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we understood
that our mother, father,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and the tree of life that
we have in our planet

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
related to the
animals and vegetals

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
were related to the blood,
to the water, to the DNA.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So we needed to be balanced
in that time in order

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.430 align:middle line:90%
to live properly in this world.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But we knew also that
the spiritual mind

00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
was created in this world.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So everything that was in
our mind, our personalities,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
everything that was creating
the way we can see the world

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
was ruled by the sun and
the 12 aspects of the sun.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:84%
This is why still
today we understand

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that our personalities are
not just created by the DNA

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and by our history
in this planet.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But also, they are
transformed every time

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
through the aspects of time
in the other constellations.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.800 align:middle line:90%
That is what creates the zodiac.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The zodiac is like
a key to understand

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.620 align:middle line:84%
what is going to
happen, what happened,

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:90%
and who am I right now.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like a map we can use to
understand how the time works.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
For ancient
civilizations, it was not

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
like to make a
prophecy and something

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:90%
magical from the future.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a clock.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
As we know in our daily
life, that after 12 hours

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:90%
the sun will set.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And we will have night.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And we will have day.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And we kind of
divided the time so we

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
could know when is the
sunset, when is the sunrise.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
For the ancient cultures, they
knew that the biggest clock

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:90%
would be those constellations.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was not just
to understand when

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.860 align:middle line:84%
we have to go to sleep
every day or when

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
we have to wake up, how
many hours we have to sleep,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
how many hours we have to
work and live during the day.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It was also a clock to
understand it was not

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:90%
just for individuals.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.860 align:middle line:90%
It was for the whole planet.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
That helps us to understand
that the process in daily life

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have from being
born, grow, and then die

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
was the three processes that
we also as civilizations,

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
as material realities,
we also live.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
That helps us to
understand that there

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
is a rise of an
empire at the moment

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that the empire reached the
highest point of information

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.240 align:middle line:90%
and rule.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
fall of an empire.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So everyone in the
history of humanity

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:84%
knew that through
this clock we could

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
understand the processes in
which we would rise and fall.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:84%
That helps us know that whatever
is going to happen in history,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.010 align:middle line:84%
it would be related to the
portals and the concepts

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:90%
of the divine in the skies.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible
for a civilization

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
to keep going exactly
the same always

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
because you need to go through
the 12 phases of reality.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:84%
These 12 phases are related
just with the process

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
that every being has
to take in order to--

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.740 align:middle line:84%
become from matter to
energy to vibration.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.470 align:middle line:84%
As I said before,
the main structures

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.190 align:middle line:84%
that were created in the
universe, the main beings that

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
created everyone
else after them,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:84%
were the species of earth
fire, water, and air.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And these four
beings are related

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.430 align:middle line:84%
to the construction
of every reality

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
through the mineral
world, the water,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and the aspects of the
light and aspects of gases.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So every being that were
evolving from those four

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
statements, the four
pillars of the reality,

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
were the physical
projection of the time

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:90%
in the other dimensions.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So why for the spirit,
the process means express,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
experiment, integrate,
and transcend.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:10%
For us in the matter, we will
relate these four statements

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:10%
of the spirit, like the water,
the earth, the fire, and air.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:10%
So these four aspects
in the physical world

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.599 align:middle line:10%
are the ones that
helps us to understand

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.260 align:middle line:10%
the concepts of the divine.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:10%
So each one of them,
the four of them,

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:10%
has a process itself
to be accomplished

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:10%
in order for a being to evolve
from the matter to the divine.

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
This process brings
us to understand

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that from the very deep reality,
the beings in the material

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
world has to look to
the stars and to reach

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of the divine from
the very darkness to the light.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And that process of growth
is different in every planet.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:10%
But the meaning and the
concept is almost the same.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:10%
The first 12 phases
related to the expression

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.450 align:middle line:10%
would be the water.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.450 align:middle line:10%
The water expression
of the reality

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.410 align:middle line:10%
would be for the material
world, the body related

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:10%
to the scorpion
aspect of reality.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:10%
The aspect of
Scorpion will teach us

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:10%
how to survive in the darkness.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
That is why the process
of Scorpion in history

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
was the time when the
eagles from the sky

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:90%
fell down into the floor.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
That was the big
war that created

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
the Aessir, the ones
who came from the stars

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and fell here to live in the
underground like the scorpions.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
That was the most difficult
part of our history

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
because during
that time, everyone

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
had to go deep into our
most darkest dreams.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:10%
During the period
of Cancer, we had

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:10%
to create the new civilizations
according to the water.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.940 align:middle line:84%
That was the big
flood, the big water

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that separates all in different
realms, in different kingdoms.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:90%
So there was no more unity.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
We needed to survive
in different families.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:10%
And that was the creation
of the bounds of our soul

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:10%
and the families that were
split into the world because

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:10%
of the great fall,
and the great flood.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:10%
After that, we lived the past
2,000 years the time of Pisces.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:10%
And it was the moment
where religion were

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:10%
trying to reach the spirit.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:10%
And that is why the
chaos of our 2,000 years

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:10%
ago was the chaos to try to go
out from this physical reality

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:10%
to reach the mind, to reach
something that we call heaven--

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:10%
so something unreal
but that we all

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:10%
wanted to reach because the
spiritual mind were trying

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.070 align:middle line:10%
to call us through the heart,
through the different ideas

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:10%
of our mind.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.270 align:middle line:10%
So related to the
body, Scorpion; related

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:10%
to the soul, Cancer; and then
related to the spirit, Pisces.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Now we have to understand
the physical one,

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:84%
the experimental
part of the process.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.830 align:middle line:10%
That would be the process
of Taurus for the body,

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:10%
the process of
Virgo for the soul,

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:10%
and the process of
Capricorn for the spirit.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:84%
That would be for our bodies to
experience the material world.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Taurus constellation will
help us to understand

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:90%
that we live in this reality.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:90%
And we own this reality.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is our home.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And we need to protect it
and to live it because we

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:90%
are going to be back here.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So Taurus time was
the time of Egypt.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Taurus time was
the time of gold,

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
minerals of building the biggest
houses we could possibly have,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:90%
the temples of gods.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was the time
to honor the material

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:90%
world that we have created.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Then we needed Virgo.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Virgo era in our history was
the time of Atlantean times.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It was the time of order.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So everything that was created,
everything that is physical,

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.090 align:middle line:90%
we need to put order within.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.790 align:middle line:10%
So the Virgo era will put
the order in the beings

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:10%
so we can use every one of
those chakras in a proper way.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And after that, all this
order will be connected

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:90%
in just one, the self.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Capricorn time in Earth is
the experimentation of wisdom.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:84%
The last period was the moment
when Nemnir came to the planet.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So that was the moment when the
wise people from the heavens

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
went to the caves to take care
of the wisdom of this planet.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:10%
The integration
process of this period

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:10%
was the trinity of the fire.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:10%
The trinity of fire would
be for the body Aries.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Aries would be the
process of ego.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
The process of ego is
to fight for something

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
that you believe is yours,
to take care of something

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:90%
that you claim to be the owner.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So that was the time of
fighting for kingdoms.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The war time of Aries
shows us that we

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:84%
needed to take care of ourselves
to survive in this planet.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we need the
process of the soul.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:84%
The process of the
soul would be Leo.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Leo is when the soul
recognizes the power within.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:10%
It's not to take power over
the things that were created.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's to take power
of your own self.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:10%
So the time of Leo
would be the time

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:10%
to rise the kingdom
within, to make

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:10%
the ego the process of the self.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
After that, we need the
process of the spirit.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit would
be Sagittarius time.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The time of Sagittarius
was the time when

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:90%
everyone came from the skies.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And they start to reach
every portal of the planet.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So thousands of years ago,
the time of Sagittarius

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
was the time when
the confederation

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
came to this planet to seed
the seeds all over the planet.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:84%
This time is also related
with the time when

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
the people from the skies give
the fire to every humanity, so

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
giving the power to
humanity to rule themselves.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
To have the power
to rule the fire

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
would be the power to grow to
transform our DNA by cooking

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and transform our way of ruling
the spiritual mind on Earth.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:10%
And the last process
is transcendence.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Transcendence is air.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And the trinity of air
would be for the body,

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:90%
the expression of Gemini.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Gemini, it would be the
time of 2,000 years in which

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the civilization would
split their own ideas

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and they will try to understand
God in different ways.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
This was the period
of the creation

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
of most of the languages that
we have today in our world.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.590 align:middle line:84%
This time was the
period where everyone

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:90%
started to split the ideas.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So everyone was trying
to reach the idea of God

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:90%
After the process of Gemini--

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:84%
the body, the relationship
between everyone,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
like different countries,
different languages,

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:84%
different ways of
understanding reality--

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:90%
we have the process of the soul.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The process of
the soul is Libra,

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is the balance that was brought
by Arcturians and the Sirius

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
That period of time, it
was when the civilization

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:84%
was trying to find
the harmonious process

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:90%
to rule the planet.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:84%
So they gave the power to humans
to rule and to be balanced

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:90%
in humanity in the world.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
After the process
of the soul, we

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.960 align:middle line:90%
need the process of the spirit.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the new era
we are starting right now,

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Aquarius.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius time is to try
to put this loss within.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It's to try to put
those languages

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and those communications
with God within.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So Aquarius is the
one holding the ideas

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:90%
in the mind of the universe.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So that is why the
next 2,400 years for us

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:48.110 align:middle line:84%
would be the time in which
we need to reach God within.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
This four triangles
of realities,

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
these four beings that created
all the patterns around,

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that are
creating our time.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So this big clock is
helping us to understand

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that no matter what we
do, after 2,000 years

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.160 align:middle line:84%
our civilization and the idea of
this civilization will change,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
will die.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And another one will be born.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
This is also the idea not only
for humans and the planets

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
in the physical
shape to understand

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that everything in the
universe is bounded by time.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is happening
in our physical realities

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and in our energetical
realities through time and space

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
are just the clock that
the spiritual mind has

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to understand when is the time
to be body, when is the time

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
to be soul, when is
the time to be spirit,

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and how the three of them
in the four realities

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:84%
can help us to
understand the self

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.595 align:middle line:90%
and what are we capable of.

00:26:49.595 --> 00:26:52.372 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.372 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide Matias De Stefano.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode, we will
explore the confederation's

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:10%
plan to make humans into gods.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:90%
