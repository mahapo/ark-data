Before we take this journey to the origin of the universe, he offers us his unique understanding of the Akashic Records, which contain all information from every dimension of reality. Ancient civilizations knew of these records but accessing them is no small feat. \nAt the beginning of everything, there was no light, space and time. Just thoughts that made waves; waves that made sound and light. And from that, everything we now know came into being. We have been told that our goal is to reach out to the stars. But to truly understand who we are and our place in the universe, we must go inward, to the first dimension. This is where we can find our higher selves and the truth. Our own reality is one of several pillars of reality, and we can learn how to consciously create new ones. We are the architects of reality.\nSubtitles: English, Français, Deutsch, Czech","teaser":"In this first episode of Initiation, Matias De Stefano takes us deep into the first dimension where we understand that all existence stems from unity.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/61ce3e31-e20f-4dd2-83f8-b8ce0388efbf?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/406b85ae-9673-4d3d-8f18-5a0492e4cd2c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/406b85ae-9673-4d3d-8f18-5a0492e4cd2c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/406b85ae-9673-4d3d-8f18-5a0492e4cd2c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":null},{"seriesId":183818,"seriesTitle":"Initiation","seriesPath":"series/initiation","seriesVoteDownCount":1275,"seriesVoteUpCount":20082,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/9a63013e-5bd1-4fe4-a1a2-25158dac4dd6?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2019-09-30","episode":2,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/fb5d633b-659c-403d-8631-830eff450ae5?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b4864919-8c92-4232-88b8-3984f082d5ba?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Matías De Stefano","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/duality","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/9a63013e-5bd1-4fe4-a1a2-25158dac4dd6?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":1,"title":"Duality","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26615","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"New Spirituality","weight":0},{"content_id":"207967","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/hidden-history","name":"Hidden History","weight":1},{"content_id":"26651","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/talk","name":"Talk","weight":0},{"content_id":"122453","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/matias-de-stefano","name":"Matías De Stefano","weight":0},{"content_id":"207739","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/6-hidden-history-rc","name":"6 - Hidden History RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"120011","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"transformation","name":"Transformation","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":166,"voteUpCount":9962,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":47,"seasonCount":4,"preview":{"duration":121,"mediaId":183867,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":183867,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":1526,"mediaId":183866,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":183866,"isFree":false},"id":183826,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"From the single point of unity, in the first dimension, all reality is created by duality.

You can still walk this same path that the Atlanteans did and awaken this information in yourself.","teaser":"Matias De Stefano takes us on a journey to discover chakras along the Nile River and the ancient Atlantean temples that were built to emulate the structure of the universe to create a path of initiation.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/2a77ab58-dcf1-46e7-8c78-4498974084cd?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3d6be90d-5078-45ea-9676-569272d510de?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3d6be90d-5078-45ea-9676-569272d510de?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3d6be90d-5078-45ea-9676-569272d510de?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":null},{"seriesId":183818,"seriesTitle":"Initiation","seriesPath":"series/initiation","seriesVoteDownCount":1275,"seriesVoteUpCount":20082,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2021-03-23","episode":3,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3367c2c5-da63-45ee-8292-d7ee11b3f325?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Matías De Stefano","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/vibratory-language-of-atlantis","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":3,"title":"Vibratory Language Of Atlantis","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26616","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Esoteric","weight":0},{"content_id":"203710","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/atlantis","name":"Atlantis","weight":0},{"content_id":"120386","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/illuminati-symbols","name":"Ancient Symbols","weight":1},{"content_id":"207967","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/hidden-history","name":"Hidden History","weight":1},{"content_id":"26651","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/talk","name":"Talk","weight":0},{"content_id":"122453","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/matias-de-stefano","name":"Matías De Stefano","weight":0},{"content_id":"207739","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/6-hidden-history-rc","name":"6 - Hidden History RC","weight":0}],"voteDownCount":43,"voteUpCount":1770,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":47,"seasonCount":4,"preview":{"duration":126,"mediaId":205218,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":205218,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":1672,"mediaId":205217,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":205217,"isFree":false},"id":203188,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Matias De Stefano introduces us to the sacred vibratory language of Atlantis, which they used to build realities through their technology of frequency and sound.

Matias De Stefano recalls memories from a life in the northern region of the Planet Gludok, near Sirius A, and reveals why these people came to our planet. Before the time of Atlantis, people from the Southern region of Gludok came to Earth to awaken the flow of energy and increase consciousness on our planet. To awaken this earthly kundalini, they activated a flow of energy from the North to the South pole, then horizontally along the planet. This was facilitated by the careful placement of gold disks to open powerful energetic portals around and within the planet.  At these important places, we find the location of ancient temples and civilizations like Mu and Atlantis. Once the kundalini energy was flowing, the people from Northern Gludok came to Earth to work with early humans, the twelve families, and the architects of Atlantis to create temple structures that help humanity harness this powerful energy. \n\nWe must remember that humanity is the consciousness of Earth, as we act as neurons for the planet.

But it failed as this growing empire began using their prevailing cosmic knowledge to assert power and control over the world.  Civil war broke out creating disharmony among the disparate colonies disengaging from control by the mother civilization. The leaders of Atlantis then engaged in a last-ditch effort to control the consciousness of the ever-widening diaspora. This act of desperation led to the demise of the once great civilization, sinking it into the ocean and the annals of mythistory. In modern times, as we are now exiting the Age of Pisces, we are awakening our consciousness as we regain these stories and once again reconnect across the generations. In this final episode of season 3, Matias De Stefano reveals a deeper understanding of the vast pyramid network that the Empire used for control, how the misuse of this power disrupted the planet, and how we must learn from these stories. We are entering into a time when we can rediscover the power we once had, open portals to knowledge in higher dimensions, and once again fully awaken the consciousness of the planet.","teaser":"During the Age of Scorpio, Atlantis was formed as the civilization to unify consciousness with and across the planet.
