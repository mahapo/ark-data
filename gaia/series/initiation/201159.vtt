I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore these two species

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:10%
and uncover how they created
the first human civilizations

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim were the
architects of the universe.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
They needed different
perspectives of evolution

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
in order to create the
idea of a living being.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:84%
In order to have a process of
a living planet and a living

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary path for
every spiritual being born

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.820 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, they
needed the fourth dimension

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to be also rooted in
the physical worlds,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
so that's why they
needed the four

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:90%
processes to create a sphere.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:10%
They needed positive
and negative,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:10%
and also they needed
life and death.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:84%
For human species
when we started,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
we had to understand the
world in a way physical.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
We counted the realities
around us through our fingers.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why we had this count of
10 because we have 10 fingers.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:84%
But we in Atlantan times,
the counting was 12.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
12 was the 10 fingers
plus the hands.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And there was a 13,
which was the connection

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
to the heart, the main point.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So we said that we had 12
aspects in the physical world,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and we have a 13
in the timeline.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:10%
So this structure
made us recognize

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:10%
that we needed to
live and to see

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.920 align:middle line:10%
the reality through 12 different
aspects, 12 different faces.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:10%
And at the moment when the
people from the skies came,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.800 align:middle line:10%
we could understand by seeing
the reality of the planet we

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:10%
were in, that the planets,
that the structures were not

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:10%
only physical but also
structural by time.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we seek
the shape of the 12,

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
multiply it by many times by the
times of the spirit, the soul,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and the body.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we had the
nine path of the spirit,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
the mind, plus the
one that is created,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
realizing about the mind
of the universe, then

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the soul of the universe,
and then the physical one.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So we had the 10/10/10
structure of the universe.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have these 12
faces of realities

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:90%
in the three-dimensional world.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:10%
So uniting the timelines
of the process, which

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:10%
were the 10/10/10,
and then uniting

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:10%
the faces of the process,
which were the 12

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:10%
aspects of numerology
that we had in Atlantis,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:10%
we found 360 degrees.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The people from
the space help us

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
understand that
these two together

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:90%
gave the shape of a sphere.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The shape of a sphere
was these 360 degrees

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that were born from these
three aspects of unity, which

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
were the 10 of spirit, 10
soul, 10 body in the 12

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.110 align:middle line:90%
phases of the matter.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So the 12 by 30 would
give us this reality

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere, which we should
accomplish, that we should see

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
as a being, as a shape, that
we had to imitate to get

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:90%
into the core of reality.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So this introduction of
the time and space dividing

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
by 60, by 30, by
90, was a structure

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
brought by the high-level
beings in other dimensions.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
At the time where
humanity was arising

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we had to
go to every spot of the planet,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
this mathematics
helped us to find

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
the portals of the
planet and the times

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:90%
in which we should do that.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
That helps us to understand
that humanity was not only

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
a civilization in one spot, but
we had to go into many spots

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:90%
into different times.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment we reach every
space and every time in the 360

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
degrees of the
sphere, we were going

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to reach
the mind of God.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was a concept that
the architects of the universe

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:90%
brought.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a concept brought by
the Sirian people from Inna.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones helping us

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we should
keep the numbers of the sphere

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
in order to get to the core.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.025 align:middle line:84%
And that brings us to
understand that the reality--

00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:90%
it was not perfect.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if we created
a perfect reality,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have the timeline
to improve the reality.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the project
was to reflect the perfection

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and make, like, distortion
of the project, so we

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
don't have it specifically the
perfection of time and space.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So we could always evolve
and always transform

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:90%
and not to be the same.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
That was the project of
what we called now Lucifer.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer was the being in
the sixth dimension that

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:84%
created this idea of going
outside the perfection project

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and creating a
little delay in time

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and a little
distortion in space.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:10%
We could have this
opportunity to have

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:10%
another process of experience,
another process of introduction

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:10%
to time and space.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:10%
And this kept us
involved in this reality,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.180 align:middle line:10%
like if it were a labyrinth
from where we cannot escape.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.030 align:middle line:10%
The old architects
of Sirius taught

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:10%
to the architects in
this planet that we

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:10%
had this unbalanced
time and space

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:10%
in the process of evolution.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So we needed to
honor that process

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
and to make it in balance.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have in this
planet the 360 degrees

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and 360 days to
accomplish the perfection.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But the structure of
the sixth dimension

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
switched it to more days, so
we never find the perfection

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:84%
so we could improve once
and again, once and again,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.930 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So this five more days that
we have in our calendar

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
are to help us
evolve in another way

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
so we could be free
from perfection.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Because for beings in this
sixth dimensional realities,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:84%
perfection is something
that settles you

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of
everything is perfect

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.382 align:middle line:90%
so there's nothing to do.

00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And the goal of
the sixth dimension

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is to have stuff to create,
to improve, to transform.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
changed the time and space

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:84%
so we could have distortion
of this reality of perfection.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why these other five
days we have in this planet

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
are those to celebrate
the opportunity

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
to evolve, to
transform, and to honor

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.317 align:middle line:90%
the diversity in the universe.

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Positive and negative
were the ones

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that created the idea
of the mind and heart.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:10%
There were the emotions
and the thoughts.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:10%
And those two ways of
creating the path of evolution

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.340 align:middle line:10%
made these two structures
of positive and negative

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:10%
be limited in the
space through time,

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:10%
by creating these
two species or races

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:10%
that help us to survive in
the three-dimensional worlds.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:10%
Like the reptilians,
the Soffhir,

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:10%
and Nemnir, the
giants, these two

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:10%
were populating
the worlds in order

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:10%
to bring the
emotions and the mind

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:10%
and to put all the
information in just one spot.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But also they needed
another perspective.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.620 align:middle line:84%
That was the integration and
the transcendence of that.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.100 align:middle line:10%
In time, that we have
the four perspectives

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:10%
of the cycle of evolution,
expression, experimentation,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:10%
integration, and
transcendence, we

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:10%
needed also that four
statements of time

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:10%
rooted in the space, what
we call north, south,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:10%
east, and west.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So as reptilians and giants
were the rulers of the north

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and south, the positive
and the negative,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
the new ones on
ruling the space would

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.350 align:middle line:84%
have to be the balance
in between east and west.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
The balance between
east and west

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
would mean that the
cycle of consciousness

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.760 align:middle line:84%
would be to awake
and to go to sleep.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
In every cycle that
we are going to have

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
along the history
and the story, we

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
need the consciousness
to be awake

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:90%
in every part of the sphere.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we needed
two civilizations

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to be in the opposite of the
planet so when one is sleeping,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
the other one is
activated by the sun.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
That is why the
civilization of Alithir

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
has to come to this planet
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the opposite of it,
in the Mediterranean Sea

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and Middle East, the
Aessir had to come

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:90%
to be the race of the sun.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantan times,
we used to call

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.200 align:middle line:10%
them the Alithir and Aessir.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:10%
But now you may know them,
Alithir as the Mu civilization

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:10%
and Aessir as the Annunaki.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:10%
One of the main reasons
why Alithir came here,

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:10%
according to the plan of Elohim,
200,000 years ago was to see

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:10%
if it was possible for some
beings from other planets

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:10%
to live literally in
this planet and to see

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:10%
if the [? immunological
? ] system of the Earth

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't kill them.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So these beings that
came from outer space

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to live in the oceans, they were
trying to understand the Earth

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and to be really connected
to Earth, to plants,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to the stones, to
the minerals, so they

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
could be related and known by
the Earth as a part of them.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But it took a long
time for them to be

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
able to settle a
civilization in this planet.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:10%
And also 50,000 years ago,
the Aessir did the same.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:10%
They started to analyze
the whole planet

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:10%
and to see where it was better
to settle the civilization.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.290 align:middle line:84%
They were more
attached to humans,

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and they used to inhabit
the deserts, the mountains,

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.770 align:middle line:90%
and the continents.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.860 align:middle line:84%
They came to this
planet to populate

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
the vast amount of
ground, and they

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
were ruling the highest
mountains of the world

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
while the other ones
were in the sea.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So both civilizations has this
positive and negative structure

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
in which on one hand had the
west and the Pacific Ocean,

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
were connected to the
water, and the other ones

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:90%
were connected to Earth.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So both civilizations
where one also, Alithir

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
Earth and Aessir

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:90%
connected also to the sun.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were
called the civilization of sun.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And once they settled
in Middle East,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
they created the
first civilizations

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
around 20,000 years ago,
bringing the sun to Earth,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
bringing the heaven
on this planet.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
The Alithir were
guided to this planet

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:84%
through the biggest portal
that the Earth has created.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was when the
moon crashes with Earth.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:84%
The biggest crater that
exists in the planet

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.650 align:middle line:90%
is the Pacific Ocean.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So the middle of
the Pacific Ocean

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
was the portal through
where all the water

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and all information
from the skies

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:90%
came straight to this planet.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why that was the
biggest portal through where

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
these higher level beings could
enter this planet, this world.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And this creator has this
Trinity imprinted on it

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
with Earth, so they
populated all the region

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to hold information
from this crater,

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
and they settle in this
triangle of islands,

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:84%
which is Hawaii; Rapa Nui,
Easter Island; and New Zealand.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
All the information from
water, life, and the sky,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
it's in the middle of
those three islands.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So that is why they had these
buildings in New Zealand,

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
in Micronesia, in the statues
of Easter Island, Rapa Nui.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
All these are bonded
with Alithir culture.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
We used to call the Alithir
the angels of the sea

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:84%
because they were
so subtle that we

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
used to see them like
angels because they

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
had this special way of body
that they seemed so angelical.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
They were very tall
with long face,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and they had always
the same face,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
like, if nothing happened,
not even if something wrong

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:84%
was happening or something
good was happening,

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:90%
they were always centered.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
They were so soft that they
seemed to be levitating.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:10%
And we had this
idea that they came

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:10%
from the core of the light of
the galaxy, the star of Vega,

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:10%
the heart of the galaxy.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:10%
They were these angels on Earth,
connected to air and water,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:10%
and they populated all the
Pacific Ocean and the Indian

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Ocean.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And they were like the
keepers of the information

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:90%
of the water.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So Nemnir were the keepers
of the ice in the past,

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and they were the
keepers of the water

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
so they had a lot
of relationship

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
with all the whales,
dolphins, and the animals

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
in the water that keep the
information through sound

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and vibration inside the water.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Some people remember
that their civilization

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
had like this crystal
cities, like shiny cities.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
specifically crystal.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They were decorated with
quartz, so the vibration

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
can hold information, and
that's what made it so shiny.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
In this planet, we needed
stone to hold information

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
so they had these big
structures made up with stones

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:90%
and decorated with quartz.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So they could have
this information

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.700 align:middle line:90%
shining in their cities.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:84%
And what they used to travel
was more magnetical and moving

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.319 align:middle line:90%
by themselves.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:84%
They used to live here, and
they had no communications

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
with the outer world in space.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
moved through ships

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
that had these
quartz plates that

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
could move through the ocean
by vibration than a spaceship

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Alithir were connected
through telepathy,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and their civilization
used to work like beehive.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They had not this
structure that we

00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
have in society with debates,
with kings or queens.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Even if they had
kind of a queen,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
it was not the ruler
of the civilization.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
They were all almost the
same, and nobody used

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:90%
to say to anyone what to do.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
They kind of just
vibrate, like bees,

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and they could communicate
through that vibration.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
the water, vibration

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
flows better so that's why
whales and dolphins had

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.500 align:middle line:84%
a better communication
with them.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So all the information
of the oceanic creatures

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:90%
was passed to them.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And the information from
the heavens, from the stars,

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
was passed to the
whales and dolphins

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
through them, through
the vibration.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:90%
They had this big heart chakra.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And the beat of their hearts--

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
they used to say, the
beat of the hearts

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:03.080 align:middle line:84%
were listened in every spot
where water could reach.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you could
close your eyes,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:84%
you can even feel the
beehive vibrating still today

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.870 align:middle line:90%
in the planet.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:10%
Aessir, those who came from
the stars, from the heavens,

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:10%
from the unseen,
what we call it,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:10%
they came from one of the stars
of the Orion's constellation.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Orion portal is one of the
most important in the galaxy.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
They were big people,
like the giants.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
They had this military shape
of valor, really strong.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:53.310 align:middle line:84%
You can compare that with the
gods of Greece and Middle East,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that have all these
muscles and big beards.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
They were the first ones to be
really attached to humanity.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.920 align:middle line:10%
All the rest were
just connecting

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.520 align:middle line:10%
with humanity in some
moments and some times

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:10%
and not really in a
strict connection.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But Aessir had come here
to really modify who we are

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:90%
and why we're here.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:84%
They came to this planet guided
by the Orion's constellation

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.440 align:middle line:84%
but not directly from the
constellation of Orion.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
They came from other
planets that were dying.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Because they have nowhere to
go, their confederation kind of

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:84%
guided them here
because they knew

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
that the potential
that they had was

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
able to awake the potential
of humanity very fast.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they came
here, guided by the Elohim

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:90%
with a major purpose.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:90%
But they had their own purpose.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Their own purpose was
to take all the material

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that they could from
this planet so they

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:90%
can rebuild their own planet.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:84%
They needed minerals
from this world

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
so they needed workers to
take the minerals for them.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why they brought
this system of families.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Now they start to rule every
region, like different families

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that had different kingdoms to
rule different races of humans.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And they started to control
them with mind and heart.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.350 align:middle line:84%
They saw that humans, we were
really weak in mind and heart,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
so it was really
easy to convince us

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
they were coming from
heaven so they were gods.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't do whatever they
wanted, it would be bad for us.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
They were really powerful, but
their power was just ideas.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.720 align:middle line:84%
They had only ideas
of how to rule.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And because the
first civilization

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that helped humans to aware of
themselves were the reptilians.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
Aessir, the Annunaki,

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.840 align:middle line:84%
took the reptilians'
idea to show themselves,

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
like part of that
civilization, so they

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:84%
could accept the idea of
power through the snake.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
they chose the Iran

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
portal of the heart
of the snake to teach

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
people about the wisdom
but in their way.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.725 align:middle line:84%
So they took men to do the
control of the society.

00:22:44.725 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
They were the first ones to
bring the language of gods

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:90%
here on planet.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
They didn't use
the mind to talk.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They used the tongue,
used the throat.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:90%
They used words.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So they were more
connected to the humans,

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and they also had
relations with humans.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So many of the
people in this planet

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:84%
were descendants of
those people that we were

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.828 align:middle line:90%
calling the giants, Annunaki.

00:23:18.828 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Due to the evolution
of this planet,

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.520 align:middle line:90%
we have been so many creatures.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
We have inside the
information of ever

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
being in the oceans, every bird,
every reptilians, every mammal.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have all this
information within that

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness and
aware of the individual

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:90%
for the first time as humans.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We call all that
information emotions.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are the energies
that hold all the programmings

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of all evolution and
every being that we

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:90%
have been in the whole history.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So the species
that came to Earth,

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.130 align:middle line:84%
they knew that we had a
part of them in this planet,

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
so they were attached
to that part of us.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And they passed the information
from their own worlds

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:84%
through the codes that
were similar in this world.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So we had the codes of
reptiles in this planet

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
from very, very
long in evolution.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But they took that
information that we had within

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:36.390 align:middle line:84%
to help them to transcend
through evolution.

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
In order to survive in this
planet we needed two emotions,

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.200 align:middle line:90%
and they are very important.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:84%
One is fear, and the
other one is frustration.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Those two emotions were
related to the tools

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:10%
we had to survive because,
through frustration, we

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:10%
recognize our limits.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we recognize
our limits, we'll

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
look for tools in order to
go over that frustration

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:90%
and that limit.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And through the
emotion of fear, we

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.760 align:middle line:84%
knew how to survive because
by hiding, by fighting,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
we could be alive more
time than if we just

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:90%
don't care about anything.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why animals has
just this main emotion,

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:38.520 align:middle line:84%
mostly fear, because it's
the one that keeps us alive.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.164 align:middle line:84%
But this is while
we are unconscious.

00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
The Annunaki, they
were those giants

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that some ancient
cultures call Nephilim.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:10%
They designed a
system to control us

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:10%
and to make fear of us.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
What they did was
to create many ideas

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
in our society, some creatures
attacking us, some demons.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But those creatures,
they never existed.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
They were only in our mind,
but they were using that image

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
in order to control
us to keep going

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:90%
with their harvest of energy.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:84%
This information about
energy that we call emotion

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.880 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important things

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that the universe has
created because emotions

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
are the portals towards
every dimension.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Whoever rules their emotions
are able to transcend

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:84%
every dimension
in just one spot.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that every human is
like a big energy factory that

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
is opening portals
all the time, but we

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to use it.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So the reptilians
first saw this,

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and they thought that women
were the factories of people.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So we had to teach women
how to use that energy.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And from that energy, we would
know how to use male energy.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of a matriarchal
civilization in which the women

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
were ruling through emotion
all the masculine aspect

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:90%
of society.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But after a long time
when Aessir came to Earth,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Aessir took that information
from the emotions,

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and they made us forget
how to handle emotions.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So we had no idea how to
use this factory of energy

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:90%
that we have within.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So as much energy we
lose, they had more energy

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:90%
to feed their own worlds.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is not only for the
species that came in that time.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It's also for the species
that brought them here

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:84%
to this planet in
the fourth dimension.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Fourth dimension
doesn't eat things

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.562 align:middle line:90%
in the three-dimensional world.

00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
They didn't eat fruits.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:90%
They didn't eat meat.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
They don't eat
nothing but energy.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they needed people
in the three-dimensional world

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.890 align:middle line:84%
creating a lot of energy, so
they could eat and survive

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is why a lot of
beings in the fourth dimension

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:84%
are trying to control
that we are not

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:41.100 align:middle line:84%
able to handle our emotions,
so they can still eat.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that we
cannot judge because we do

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
the same with
animals and plants.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:54.610 align:middle line:10%
The teaching of some Aessir,
some Nemnir, some Alithir,

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:10%
and some Soffhir
were to teach humans

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:10%
to be able to handle
those emotions because we

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:10%
had two different people in
every one of those species.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
The ones that said we need
to use humans as factories

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to get our minerals
for our worlds,

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to get energy to
feed our spirits,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and there were the other ones
that said but we are dying.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:84%
If we die and they are
alive, so we lose anyway.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we had to do is
to transcend through them

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and teach them our ways, so
we can survive in history

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.980 align:middle line:90%
through their blood.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have these two
ways in which some reptilians

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:46.720 align:middle line:90%
wanted to control us.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Some reptilians
wanted to help us.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Some Annunaki wanted to help us.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Some Annunaki wanted
to control us.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:84%
There was not all of them
trying to do the same.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's why one
of those families

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:07.490 align:middle line:84%
started to be against the
rules of one of the Aessir,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and they gave the power
to humans to build

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:90%
their own civilizations.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:84%
That is the moment that
every human and every culture

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:23.386 align:middle line:84%
in the planet in the same time
discovered how to handle fire.

00:30:23.386 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:90%
[FLAMES WHIPPING]

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we had
in this mythology

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
in the ideas of Greece
and India and Mexico

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and every culture in
the world, in Egypt, we

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:84%
have these families of
giants that were teaching us

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:84%
how to handle emotions
inside, but also a few of them

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:84%
trying to control
this world, trying

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.470 align:middle line:84%
to control the energy
that we create every day.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Alithir came to see how they
could fit in this planet.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when their
time period finished,

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
they just passed
their information

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.410 align:middle line:84%
to every shamanic
culture in Asia,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia, and all the regions
of west United States, Canada,

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Alaska, Central America,
and all the Andes Mountains.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:84%
They gave that
information so we could

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
have that knowledge of how
to be related to the Earth

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
and heaven at the same time.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But what we have more present
today is what Aessir gave us.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Aessir gave us the
structure of society.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Aessir gave us the basis of our
culture, our society structure.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
They gave us the construction
of the first temples

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:90%
with big stones.

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
We can find these big stones
and big temples that they built

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and they created
all over the planet.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.050 align:middle line:84%
They had settlements
in Middle East

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.290 align:middle line:84%
all over and in the
Mediterranean Sea,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.990 align:middle line:90%
in Central America, in Asia.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.170 align:middle line:84%
They had different
spots, wherever

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
you find these big blocks,
these big stones, that

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.150 align:middle line:84%
are the basements
for the new temples,

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:29.650 align:middle line:84%
were guided by the Aessir
and built by humans.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So even if they have been not
much nice with us in history,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:84%
most of them have given to us
the main tools that we have

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.110 align:middle line:90%
today to create civilizations.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:48.670 align:middle line:84%
They have given us the
power of revolution,

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to realize that there is
no one that can control us,

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have more
power, because we

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.788 align:middle line:84%
are the main source of
the power of everyone.

00:32:58.788 --> 00:33:01.540 align:middle line:90%

In the next episode, we
will explore a series

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.457 align:middle line:84%
on Orion, and why these
major portals became

00:33:11.457 --> 00:33:13.290 align:middle line:84%
the fathers and the
mothers of civilization.
