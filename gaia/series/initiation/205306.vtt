>> How did some humans come to
be called gods and goddesses?

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.860 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
the path some humans took

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
to contact the divine.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
When the main information came
to this planet, the network

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.080 align:middle line:84%
information from the
mind of the universe,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
we understood that everything
was connected through the mind,

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:84%
through very big synapses
that connect every reality

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.930 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
We understood that the
image of this network

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:84%
was like waves through
time that were moving

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
like the waves of
the ocean, but they

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:90%
split in the shape of a circle.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So in order to understand the
circle and lengths of time

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and space dividing and
crossing these waves of time,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
we kind of related with
the spiderwebs, the spider

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.980 align:middle line:84%
webs where the shapes that
represented the most how

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
the waves of time were moving
in a spiral, in a circle way,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and then the lines of
space were crossing

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:90%
all these waves of time.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So this was time
and space connected.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And we start to call
the weavers of reality

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
like, the
interdimensional spiders.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:10%
When the web of the spider
has crossed every timeline

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:10%
and every space line and
start to split and divide

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:10%
by polarity, creating
the spheres, the cells

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:10%
of the first consciousness
of the universe,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:10%
it start to create the
patterns in which every one

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:10%
of those aspects of God would
be expressed, would transcend,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:10%
would create realities.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.780 align:middle line:84%
In order to understand
how they work,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.130 align:middle line:84%
you have to think about
God as a big sphere that

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
holds a tortoise within in
the middle with the shape

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
of the time, and then, within,
you have the other spheres

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
in the seventh and
the sixth dimension,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and then, inside, we
have the fifth dimension.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And these beings
are the patterns

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that hold the core
of reality and that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
breathe all the information
from the outer spheres

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
to the core ones.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And once you have the
fifth dimension patterns,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
you have the fourth, the four
one in the times, and then

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the third one close
by the core, and then

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.520 align:middle line:84%
the second one, which is the
polarity, time and space,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and the last one, the unity.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.180 align:middle line:10%
To understand all the beings,
to understand where they are

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:10%
and how to organize
them, we can call

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:10%
that the main source of energy,
the main concepts of the mind,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:10%
is the god-goddess
that starts to create

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:10%
the process of
patterns around, and we

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:10%
call the masculine
aspect the purpose

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:10%
and the feminine
aspect the matrix.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:10%
So these two aspects
start to first vibrate,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.270 align:middle line:10%
and by resonance,
by vibration, they

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:10%
create what we call
the cherubims or wanim.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:10%
The name cherubims
is the ones that

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:10%
are more pure and more connected
to the source of the energy.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:10%
So these vibrations that we
named the cherubims in history

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:10%
are the main vibrations of
the universe from the purpose

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:10%
and the matrix.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Once we have the vibration,
which is the cherubims,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:90%
we have the energy.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:10%
And the energy
patterns which will

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:10%
be enlightened in
the seventh dimension

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:10%
will be those what we
call the seraphims.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:10%
Seraphims are the beings that
represents the rays of light.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:10%
And each one of them are the
concepts or the main ideas

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:10%
that resonates and
vibrates, creating

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:10%
the energy towards the souls.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:10%
So they are the fathers
and mothers of the souls.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:10%
They are the main souls
of the universe that

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:10%
goes through everything and
that connects every reality.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:10%
And from them, the
patterns of energy

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:10%
start to create the
patterns of matter.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.900 align:middle line:84%
These connections and
structure through geometry

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
we named archangels.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The archangels are the
potentiality structures

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
of the wheels of God,
the wisdom, the love.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So those are really
wide open aspects

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:90%
to cover in the universe.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the sixth
dimension, the structure

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
put some limitations,
some boundaries

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:90%
into all of these aspects.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:10%
So the cells and the
architects of the universe

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:10%
would understand the
limits, the process,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:10%
the endings the transition
in between each one

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:10%
of the learnings and
teachings in the universe.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:10%
So this structure
created the cube

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.630 align:middle line:10%
that connected every
dimension and every reality

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:10%
in different times
and different space.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:10%
This structure in
the sixth dimension

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:10%
that holds every
aspect of the divine

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:10%
and that seeds
the main structure

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:10%
to create every other
reality in the fifth, fourth,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:10%
and third dimension is now
known as the metatron cube.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:10%
The metatron cube is
another way of saying God.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:10%
Is God in the sixth dimension?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:10%
Metatron is a Greek
name with which we could

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:10%
say God in geometrical shape.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:10%
All the parts of
this metatron cube

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.460 align:middle line:10%
would split like different
other seeds or fruits

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.680 align:middle line:10%
to divide in
different dimensions

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.900 align:middle line:10%
and different worlds
and different galaxies,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:10%
creating new
realities, new shapes,

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:10%
and dividing as much as possible
the lights and the concepts

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:10%
of God so we could experience
and create new realities.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:10%
That is why the
metatron cube is related

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:10%
with the light becoming dark,
with the concepts of the ideas

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:10%
becoming matter.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is why it's
the middle point

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
to create all the realities
and everything that we

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
could possibly know and
understand from the universe.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:10%
Everything is connected
through that shape

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:10%
in the sixth dimension.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:10%
So we can find
that the vibration

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:10%
beings in the eighth
dimension would

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:10%
be the cherubims connecting
all the information

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:10%
through the
resonance, and then we

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:10%
have the energy in the seventh
dimension creating the lights

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:10%
that we call the
seraphims, and then

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:10%
we have, in the sixth
dimension, the main structures,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.060 align:middle line:10%
the geometry that we
call the archangels.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So this onion shape
universe shows us

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that we all are the same
being in different aspects,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
in different levels of reality,
and that every being there

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is in the third dimension, to
understand how to become gods

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
in this reality, had
to go through all

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
of these patterns of the flower
of life, the tree of life,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and the masters
and archangels that

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
are in different
levels of vibration.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:84%
The first step
that humanity took

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to understand that they
were part of the divine

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
was to see all around,
to understand the world,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to understand nature, and to put
in every one of those aspects

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:84%
the truly divine, the different
faces of god and goddess.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:10%
So when they recognized that
the nature was the main tool

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:10%
to contact the divine, because
it was the creation itself,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:10%
they started to try to imitate
this nature by culture,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:10%
by sound.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So every culture in
the history of humanity

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
started to imitate
through agriculture,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.450 align:middle line:84%
through the words, the
sounds of every bird,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
every animal, every plant and to
copy those codes, the flowers,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
the seeds, the tree
into our wisdom,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
into our way to transmit
information through history,

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:90%
through humanity.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:10%
By the time the Aessir and
other species from the sky came,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:10%
the concepts of the
divine was different.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:10%
It was not trying to
imitate the nature

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:10%
and to become the
nature, but it was

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:10%
to honor the messengers
of those natures.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So we, for the first time,
took the idea of the divine

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
being everywhere and we
channeled the everywhere

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:84%
in just one spot called
gods and goddesses.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:10%
Even if they were not
gods and goddesses,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:10%
they were the messengers.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So we understood that they
were the ones through which we

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:90%
could connect with the divine.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:84%
After we did that, we
start to create the temples

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:90%
for those messengers.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So we understood that if
we go to those temples

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and we honor the beings
inside of those temples,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
we were connecting
with every tree.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
We have no need to go to nature
to understand the reality,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.560 align:middle line:84%
but if we go to the
temple of the trees,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
we will be speaking with
every tree in the world.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
If we go and speak with
the goddess of the cats,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
we would be talking
with every cat.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
So they started to be the
middle point into the divine.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
But when Arcturian and
Orion and Sirius people

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:84%
came to this
planet, they started

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
to talk to humans how to
talk through this nature,

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:53.490 align:middle line:84%
how to be the messengers of this
nature through space and time.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:84%
These humans were called
the priests and priestesses

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that were the ones in
the middle in between all

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:90%
of these concepts of God.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We understood at that
time that humans were just

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.660 align:middle line:84%
the neurons trying to interpret
the divine in different levels

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
become the messengers

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
of all the realities, we
have to be those realities.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:10%
And the first person
in history that

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.070 align:middle line:10%
were taught about how
to become that reality

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:10%
was the biggest architect
in Atlantean times, Djehuty.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Djehuty was one of those
gods that he was not

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:10%
a being in other
dimensions, he was

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:10%
a priest that was born
in Atlantean times,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.910 align:middle line:10%
and he accomplished to
become part of nature.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:10%
So he was the first
human to be taught

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.860 align:middle line:10%
about how to go through
time and to learn

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:10%
about the future
tools, the past tools,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:10%
and how to build a present image
in every space and every time.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:10%
So that's how he accomplished
to build realities

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:10%
through time and space in
this reality here and now.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:10%
That helped him to build the
idea of a civilization based

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:10%
on other levels
of consciousness,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:10%
trying to imitate the
sky, tried to imitate

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:10%
the different levels
of consciousness,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:10%
of high consciousness in the
sixth, the fifth dimension.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So he would try to put
in these 3-D matter

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
the settlements to
anchor and channel

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
the information from other
high levels of consciousness

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
so we all could understand
the world and the universe.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty and the
first masters that

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:84%
were represented like gods
and goddesses on Earth,

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
they were the magicians,
the architects

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
that could talk with other
levels of consciousness.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And they did it through
their own bodies,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
by the vibration of
their own bodies.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians taught us
that we were the construction

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world, in
matter, from the vibrations

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:90%
of every dimension.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So if we accomplish to reach
every vibration of our body,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
we could speak with every one
of the spheres that create us

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:90%
from other dimensions.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.690 align:middle line:10%
So the first humans
to be prepared

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.270 align:middle line:10%
to become gods and
goddesses, the messengers

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:10%
between dimensions,
they had to accomplish

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:10%
the perfect vibration
in their own bodies,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.650 align:middle line:10%
so every chakra become a
portal through every dimension,

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:10%
through every sphere.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
What these humans
knew and realized

00:13:53.590 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
was that they had 12 portals in
the body and surrounding them,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and at the moment
they understood

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.800 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of
each one of them,

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:84%
they understood the channels
that contact all the creation.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So these 12 portals that we
have are the same portals

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that opens the whole patterns
of the planet through the stars,

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's how they reached
the information in the fifth

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and the sixth dimension of
each one of the 12 spheres

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:90%
that create us all.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The, elohim, the archangels,
are the high level

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness beings
that holds within them

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.130 align:middle line:84%
the structures of
the fifth dimension.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is the
one that replicates the light,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:84%
but with the patterns
of the sixth dimension.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we have the
12 phases of the universe,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
but creating a
quorum of beings that

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
will try to maintain the
balance in between the 12

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
phases of a structure,
and that creates

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.990 align:middle line:90%
the nine lords of reality.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
These nine beings
are the council

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that established the
times and the shapes

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.450 align:middle line:84%
that every being has to
follow in the third dimension.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:84%
These beings are
the ones that tried

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:90%
to structure all realities.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why some of
us used to call them

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:90%
the judges of reality.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We also call that reality,
the judges of karma.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Karma means all the structures
that we have to learn from.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you have not accomplished
every learning and teaching

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
process of every
one of those codes,

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
you cannot go farther the
fifth dimension and you can--

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and you cannot create
your own realities.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you have to
accomplish every karma path.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
judges that shows you

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
if you had accomplished
that or not.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like judges
sitting on the chair.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:10%
They are the beings that
represent that vibration

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:10%
and you can only go through
them if your vibration matches

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:10%
with the same pattern
that they have.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
If they don't much, you
can go through them.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like judge is
saying you did it wrong

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:90%
or you did it well.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:10%
What they are just
doing is, go through me

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:10%
if you are able to become me.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So these patterns
holds all this reality

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:84%
until we are able to
transform realities.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:84%
This means are the
nine beings of darkness

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
on the nine beams of
light, and the 18 of them

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
creates the pattern of the
flower of life surrounding us,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
these cells that covers all
the structures of history

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
in different levels of
consciousness, which would be

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
three of them in past,
three of them in present,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and three of them in
the future, multiplying

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.829 align:middle line:84%
by the darkness ones
and the light ones.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that we
have nine levels of vibration

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in which the universe
could be expressed,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the nine dimensions that
are living three of them

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:84%
in the past, three of
them in the present, three

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of them in the future, and
are the trinity, the feminine,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the masculine, and
the son or daughter

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that are the three aspects of
this creation of realities.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go through
the nine aspects of time

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
in darkness and light in order
to accomplish this phase, which

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
are the 12 phases, and
then you accomplish

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to arrive to the
sixth dimension.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
These beings are
known in our realities

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:84%
like the masters and
guides of every dimension.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth dimension of
time and the fifth dimension

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:84%
of all other realities
and geometry, what we have

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
are all these masters,
enlightened masters that

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
accomplished to understand
every process in realities

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and they became the
patterns of light itself.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is to
resonate to the matter,

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to the system of the
matter, all the process

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
of creation to help us
understand which ways

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
we can take in order to be in
the same level of vibration

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:90%
as them.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can go through
time and space

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
searching for these patterns
through the guidance

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:90%
of these patterns.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:10%
So even the darkness
ones and the light ones,

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:10%
they are living
patterns to us so we

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.550 align:middle line:10%
could reach and understand how
we can build a good reality

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:10%
and how we can transcend
the reality we live in.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:10%
These enlightened
masters are the beings

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:10%
that have lived in
the third dimension,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:10%
the second dimension,
the fourth dimension,

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.000 align:middle line:10%
and they reach the perfect shape
towards the creation, which

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:10%
is the sixth dimension.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth dimension,
all the masters

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that accomplish to transform
themselves in new realities

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
are those who are willing
to open every portal of time

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and space and create new
universes from just one cell,

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
from just one atom.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So the priests and priestesses
of this reality and blood

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and cells embody, they
had to go through all

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
of these layers of
the universe in order

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:84%
to understand that they
were created through all

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
these layers here on Earth.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you can talk to
each one of them within,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
you are able to contact the
idea of god and the goddess.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:10%
That's why the Arcturian
people taught to these priests

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:10%
and priestesses how to
become gods on Earth

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:10%
through vibration.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the first one
on doing this was Djehuty.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.980 align:middle line:84%
This priest was the
one in charge of wisdom

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to realize the
power of the heart,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
and that is why he
represented the moon.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The moon was the one protected
the wisdom in our realities.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
So he was attached to
water through night.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
During the night, you can see
all the eyes of the universe.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the
day, you can only

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
see one eye, which is the
sun, but when it become night

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and the moon is there, you
can see thousands of eyes.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand all
the wisdom of reality.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
That is why he had to understand
every eye of the universe

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:90%
to become the universe.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:10%
This path that he
took was to try

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:10%
to read the books,
the vibrational books

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:10%
of its own body,
which are the 12

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:10%
beings that shapes every human.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
When he understood that, he
created the school of wisdom.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:10%
The school of wisdom
was a path of initiation

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:10%
in which every human
had to go through

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:10%
to rule the vibration of every
chakra and to be able to speak,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:10%
to talk with every dimension,
in every level of consciousness.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have to
understand the sun, the moon,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and the underground, the world,
the physical and more dark

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:10%
We needed to understand
that the three of them

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:10%
were the three schools that
helped us understand that we

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.530 align:middle line:10%
had to follow the
light of the sun,

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:10%
but to understand the main
information of the sun,

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:10%
we had to understand
every eye in the night.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:10%
So that's why the
school of the moon

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:10%
would teach us how to understand
all the wisdom before we

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:10%
achieve the enlightenment.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:10%
And before we
could see the eyes,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:10%
we should understand the
polarity of those eyes,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:10%
the darkness to see
the light in the night.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the school
of darkness, the school

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
ruled by Anubis,
by Seth, by Sobek,

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:84%
they were the gods
that taught us

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:84%
how to handle the snake,
how to handle the giants,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:84%
how to handle the emotions
that were pushing us

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:90%
to the underground.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And these first three
schools were very important

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
because we needed to understand
that darkness was not

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:90%
against us.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Darkness was trying to shape us.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And If we understand the shapes
and if we understand the codes

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
we are living in,
we can handle them

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and we can use
darkness as a tool

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.800 align:middle line:90%
to get the light of the sun.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
These teachings were
also the main statements

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to understand the schools
of initiation in matter,

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.415 align:middle line:84%
and that was the
teachings of the Idilien.

00:23:40.415 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:10%
Idilien were the people related
to the elemental beings.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:10%
So the four schools of Idilien
were the earth, fire, water,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:10%
and air, and these
four pillars of reality

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.660 align:middle line:10%
were the schools
where we, as Idilien,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:10%
had to understand how to
handle the earth, the matter,

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:10%
the plants, the medicine, the
water, our blood, our DNA,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:10%
everything that was
inside of our cells

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:10%
to encode information
in the water

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:10%
to learn how to read the
water, how to understand

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:10%
the fire, the heart, the
information of the spirit, how

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:10%
to modify the realities
through the fire,

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:10%
and then the air to understand
that everything was mind,

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.990 align:middle line:10%
the ideas of the universe and
how everything is connected

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:10%
through this network of mind.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:10%
These four other schools,
other temples were teaching us

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:10%
how to open the portals through
our bones, through our organs,

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:10%
through our heart, and through
our mind so we could understand

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:10%
that our bodies were the
temples that we could rebuild,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.220 align:middle line:10%
we could handle, and we could
take information from them

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:10%
so we could open the portals
through the dimensions.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to be proved
in the will of our bodies,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:90%
in love and wisdom.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The will was how we can handle
every emotion that we have

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:90%
within to construct realities.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:84%
We needed to learn
how to handle bodies,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:90%
how to make it stronger.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:10%
We need to practice
in the reality

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:10%
how to move our
bodies in every one

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:10%
of those materials, the fire,
the air, the water, and earth.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we need
to learn about wisdom.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom would be the
one school to teach us

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:84%
how to make every knowledge
that we could possibly

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
learn into just one, to learn
everything as much as possible,

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and then how to forget
everything we have to learn,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:90%
so to become a wise person.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom was not
about how to answer.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:10%
It was about how to question.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom was the key of
creating realities,

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and in order to
create, you should

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.900 align:middle line:90%
forget that everything is real.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to question
every reality in order

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
to achieve wisdom
in the universe.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
the main teachings

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:90%
of the school of wisdom.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we had
the love teaching.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The love teaching
was how to handle

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
all the energy that
comes from the sexuality

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:90%
to the unconditional love.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:90%
This was the school for women.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The women were
teaching how to handle

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the Kundalini.

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So the energy of love,
the teaching of love

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:54.220 align:middle line:84%
would teach us how to go through
every space and every time

00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
in this line that the spirit
used to get into the matter.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
When you handle the energy
of sexuality in the planet,

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:84%
you can handle the
path that the spirit

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:90%
used to be born in the planet.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Once we had all
these learnings, we

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:84%
needed to learn how to handle
time and how to handle space.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So geometry and mathematics
was the next learning,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and then we had to learn
about how to go through time

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and to heal all our history,
not only to the past,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:90%
but also, to the future.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.180 align:middle line:84%
The only way you could do
that was to be in the present.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So the last two schools was to
learn how to live here and now.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:10%
Once you accomplished the
12 schools of enlightenment,

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:57.170 align:middle line:10%
the 12 schools to match the
patterns of the reality,

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:10%
you could start and begin
to listen the vibrations

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:10%
from other dimensions.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:10%
So what you started to do was
to hear the voices of our guides

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:10%
in other dimensions.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You would start to listen to
the voices and the vibration

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
of the high masters in
the fifth dimension.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.850 align:middle line:84%
You would start to feel how
the elohim are creating us

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
You will start to feel the
power of the archangels

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
in the seventh dimension
holding you in this reality.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you match that all
in every one of your chakras,

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:84%
you become the
messenger of every being

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
that was forming you and
shaping you in every dimension.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And that made those
priests and priests

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.580 align:middle line:84%
who would be able to
become gods and goddesses.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we used to separate
in different levels

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, like humans,
Aessir, the Confederation,

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:05.690 align:middle line:84%
the guides, the angels, the high
masters, the ascended masters,

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the archangels, they
are all the same being

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:84%
in different vibrations
holding one reality.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.560 align:middle line:10%
So when you become
those realities

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:10%
through the portals
of your own body,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:10%
you are able to speak for them.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
call channeling.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.650 align:middle line:10%
Channeling was to download the
information from other levels,

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:10%
like the wire, the
Wi-Fi of the universe,

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:37.040 align:middle line:10%
and download those
patterns into the body

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.160 align:middle line:10%
when you had the
proper information that

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:10%
matches the structure
of vibration and pattern

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:10%
of geometry from those
levels of consciousness.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
allowed the priest

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and priestesses to
download this information.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:84%
By this matching, they
would bring that information

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.010 align:middle line:90%
into the matter.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:06.950 align:middle line:10%
This is also what made people in
ancient times, and even today,

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:10%
made this mistake that
we made the comparison

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.720 align:middle line:10%
that the ancient
priests of Atlantis

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:10%
had incarnated once and
again in different masters

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:10%
through history.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And ascended masters like
Osiris, Isis, Djehuty, Seshat,

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:84%
they were people alive that
channeled this information.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:10%
And also, today, we can relate
them with some special people,

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:38.330 align:middle line:10%
like Muhammad, Buddha, Jesus.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.220 align:middle line:84%
They were people
that were allowed

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to download that information
from other levels

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:90%
They were not the same person.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
They were different persons
channeling and downloading

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the same information
from different levels

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.130 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:84%
