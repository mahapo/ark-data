00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened one
million years ago?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,
Matias De Stefano.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I
am going to walk you

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.220 align:middle line:10%
through the beginning
of human civilizations

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:10%
and what that means for the
future of humanity today.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are the
ancient technology,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
not only from this
planet, but also

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
for many of them that are
part of the confederation.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
In many planets, we used
to build these structures

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
because it was a physical way
in which we could be connected

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:90%
to the 9th dimensions. .

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.870 align:middle line:84%
What we see now
as pyramids is not

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:90%
what you're supposed to see.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
What you're supposed
to see is the sphere.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
They have eight
dimensions within.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
of the pyramids

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:90%
you would see when they move.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You should not see triangles.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
You should see a sphere,
with many triangles

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
moving and waving around.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
There is a main reason
why in every planet,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
you will find these
pyramid buildings.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Like only four phases
or three phases

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
or five phases is depending on
the dimension in which you want

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to connect the faces you
will have, the structure

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
you will create.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So these structures, they
are not to go to the top.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
They are not mountains
where you go to the sun.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
They are structures
to go within.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why the chambers
are very dark in the core

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid, so you
could go within and have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the strength of every
dimension heading

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
towards the center
of the pyramid.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
When you build this structures
around a planet which

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:84%
is a sphere, you
are able to contact

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
the information
of every time line

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and every space of
this network of planet.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can go to the
core of the planet

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and you can go through
every dimension of what

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
this planet means, opening the
portals towards every dimension

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and contact every reality
and every information

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
you want to contact.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
This is like computers from
where you download programs.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.650 align:middle line:84%
But the programs are not
going to the computer itself,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:90%
but the person is within.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can record this
information in a physical way

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.300 align:middle line:90%
is by water or blood.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Water or blood are
exactly the same,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.840 align:middle line:84%
so water is the
only reality that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
can switch its vibration,
its shape, by the information

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%
that it's receiving.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why only jars of water
in the middle of the pyramids

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
or a person in the
middle of the pyramid

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones
that can imprint

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
this information
from every dimension

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:84%
within, activating
it in the DNA,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:84%
or the patterns of
the ice, the water.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So pyramids around the world are
like a big network of computers

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.890 align:middle line:84%
downloading information
from every dimension,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
so we as humans could
have this information

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
towards our own evolution
as physical beings,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
emotional beings,
and spiritual beings.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
All the pyramids in
the world are aligned,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and they work for different
kind of constellations.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
If you see the pyramids of
China, the pyramids of Egypt,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids of
Peru, what you will find

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
is that the Earth is reflecting
the portals of Pleiades, Orion,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and Sirius.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
If you see the
sky, you will find

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
that if you see the three
stars of Orion's portal,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.720 align:middle line:84%
at your left, you will
have the stars of Sirius.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:10%
At your right, you will
find the stars of Pleiades.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you see this
structure and you print it

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth, you will find
China pyramids, Egypt pyramids,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:90%
and Peruvian pyramids.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
So the whole planet can hold
the frequency of the biggest

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
portal towards
the spiritual self

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
in China, towards the biggest
portal of every dimension

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, and then improve
the order of the being,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and the order of
the Confederation.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And all this
crossing of energy is

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
like the pyramids are
aligning themselves

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:84%
so the energy of the sun always
can come inside the planet,

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and keep rolling within to
activate the whole machine.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We understood that the planet
was like a ship, a ship

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:90%
through time.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
people that used

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
to call the Earth like a ship
with no core in the middle,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and it was built just
to do experiments.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But in the past, we
understood that nature is

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:90%
the technology of the spirit.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So there was now other beings
in the universe creating

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:90%
our world.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:84%
They were just understanding
that if this world was allowing

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.830 align:middle line:84%
life to be here, it was
because we were prepared

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to use this ship through time.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids all over the world are
the antennas, the structures

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
for the nine dimensions,
so they could bring you

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:84%
through the times, and
bring all this energy

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
from the whole solar system
to the core of the planet,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:84%
so the planet
itself could become

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
a pyramid, a great octahedron
to create new realities

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:90%
in different times.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
One million years ago,
the Ice Age started.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
This Ice Age started to cover
Europe, America, and Asia,

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
ocean in the south.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
At this period of
humanity, we were

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
starting to
understand who we are

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
as a species, a
different way of species,

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and homo sapiens start being
created around the planet.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment where
the Confederation understood

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that we as humanity
were the ones picked

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
by the evolution of Earth to
be the ones that would activate

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism of knowledge,
the mechanism of thinking

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Every species is a part
of the body of the planet.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:84%
But when some of
those species start

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
memory, to activate

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of itself,
and we became like,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
aware of who we
are, we as humans

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
became the neurons of the
thoughts of the planet.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
That means that
this planet is going

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.810 align:middle line:84%
to create this network
of eight dimensions

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
From many other planets,
the Confederation

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:84%
start to come to
the planet Earth

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:84%
to prepare humanity to
be aware of themselves,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and to give them
tools to evolve faster

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:90%
than they were doing here.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are the
structure of technology

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.330 align:middle line:84%
that ancient civilizations
and alien civilizations

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:84%
from this planet used to use
to contact the ninth dimension,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and to be a creative
being connected

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.329 align:middle line:90%
to the dream of reality.

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The first ones to come from
the stars to this Earth

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.240 align:middle line:84%
were the ones in planets
where it was really cold.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The Nemnir were big beings,
like tall, very tall,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
like giant beings, and they
used to live in the ice.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
They used to live
close by the Poles

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
so they could stand
the heat of the planet.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So while humans were
trying to survive the cold,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
they were living close by the
coldest areas of the planet.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So they were kind of
protecting the ice.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, they
were the first civilizations

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
from other galaxies
or other systems

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
coming here, and recording
the data of who we are,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and why we are
here into the ice.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
At the first stages of
humanity, and the first stages

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of those civilizations
that came from the skies,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
we had this knowledge
that the only thing

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
that can keep information
through time was water.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Water is the only
element that can

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:84%
live through the time and space
constantly and never change.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they recorded
all the information

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:90%
through the water.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to put all
this information in the planet

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:90%
was through ice.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they came here
to record all the knowledge

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
from every civilization,
so we, as humans, could

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
drink that water and have
that information too, aware

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
of our purpose on this planet.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:84%
That is why North Pole
and South Pole became

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
like the libraries
of the planet,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
the places where not
only naturally, it

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
was recorded everything
that we've done,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
we are meant to be,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:84%
but not only as a species
here on this planet,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
but also as beings
around the universe.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
They started to create
these kind of civilizations

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
in the Poles, where they
could protect humanity

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
from other beings from other
levels of consciousness,

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and by doing this, they
start to give humanity

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
the first DNA that moves
us towards what we call now

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapiens-sapiens.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a very fast
evolution in that age.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We humanity were just hunting
and grabbing some fruits

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And from that moment, when these
civilizations came to Siberia,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to northern Europe, and also
in Antarctica, all of them

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
gave us the
information so we could

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:84%
know one of the most
important things that

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
changed human history
forever, storage seeds.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
They were the agriculturists
of the galaxy,

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
so they knew how to
store the seeds of DNA.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So they told us how to
store seeds of plants

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
so we could survive
during all this ice age.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
That was the seed of our
change as Homo sapien-sapiens.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:84%
We started for the
first time a village,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.530 align:middle line:90%
so we started civilizations.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.050 align:middle line:84%
After that, all
the civilizations

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that came from the sky
were willing to give us

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
some part of the
information that they had,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.170 align:middle line:84%
not only from within
but also from outside.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
They gave us tools to
build our civilizations.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
They gave us words to
understand themselves,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
so we start to speak, not
only the languages from Earth,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:90%
but also the languages from sky.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So they start to split
the world so they

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.010 align:middle line:84%
could teach to different
humans, and see

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
the reactions of every
race that we have

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:90%
here towards that information.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
500,000 years ago,
the world started

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to split into four species
that came from the sky.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I used to call the first ones
that came here the Soffhir.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Soffhir were like humans,
but the shape of a reptile.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The reptilian ones were the
ones that came here first,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
because they knew how
to adapt to a world.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:10%
So they came to the hottest
places in the world,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:10%
like Africa, like Middle
East, like Central America.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:10%
They also came to Australia
and southeast of Asia,

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:10%
and all these regions.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:10%
And they were the first one
going around the whole planet,

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:10%
looking for these people to hold
the information of the snakes

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:10%
within.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And they saw that
the only beings that

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.390 align:middle line:84%
were able to understand the
information of the snake

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:90%
were women.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So women were the
first ones that

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
were taught about
the information

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
of the whole universe,
to become alchemists.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
They as reptilians taught
the first priestesses

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
of the planet how
to transform reality

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
from the seeds from the
plants, and became shamans.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Women were the first
shamans of the world,

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and the snakes taught
them how to do that.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So after that, women taught men
how to understand the world,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and then men started to rule
the world from that information.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why this symbol of
snakes were the first symbols

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that every human has honored
in the history of humanity.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they saw
the Soffhir coming

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
from the skies like
gods, and teaching them

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:90%
the information of the snake.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
In ancient civilizations, we
understood that this snake

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:90%
is around the world.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
If you just look very deep into
the formation of the planet,

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:90%
you can see the snake.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It's connected by
the highest mountains

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
along every spinal cord
of the body of the planet.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It was the kundalini
around the whole planet.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And they followed
the path of the snake

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
so they could understand the
information of the whole world.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:84%
This information of the Soffhir
started in Anatolia, Turkey.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:10%
This is where we call the
head of the snake, the head

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:10%
of the snake, where the
whole information of the most

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:10%
important knowledge of how
to survive on this planet

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:10%
was created.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:10%
There in the core of Anatolia,
in the core of Turkey,

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:10%
they created this
small spot where you

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:10%
could see the eye of the snake.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.270 align:middle line:84%
The eye of the snake
was a settlement

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
Anatolia, where everyone

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.496 align:middle line:84%
would go to see the
snake on the eye,

00:16:15.496 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
so they could be connected
to the whole information

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
of the whole planet.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why this region there
was one of the most important

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:84%
in the world to understand
the knowledge of humanity,

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
knowledge of Soffhir.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:10%
After that you could
see the pineal gland,

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:10%
which is close by, the Ararat
Mount in the border of Armenia.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:10%
There in that region, the whole
information of the Caucasus

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:10%
was the information of
the knowledge itself

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:10%
of the soul of the snake.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
After that, you have
the heart of the snake

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:84%
in Persia, so now Iran
and Pakistan, Afghanistan.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
All this region means
the heart of the snake,

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:84%
so it is the place where the
next civilizations coming would

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:84%
activate the heart
of the information.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why many people
from other places

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
stop coming to the head and
to the tail of the snake,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:90%
and they went to the heart.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Persian Gulf was
so important for the creation

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of the new humanity.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:10%
After that, we had the
plexus of the snake,

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:10%
which is the Karakorum, that
we used to know as Tibet.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The Karakorum was the region
where the Taklamakan Desert.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:10%
There the humanity learn
how to be themselves.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
After that, the information
of the snakes go to Siberia.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, in the Baikal
Lake and all the region that

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:10%
goes to Chukotka is the
region where women were taught

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:10%
how to create the realities.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:90%
So it is the sacrum chakra.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, we
had the root chakra going

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:90%
to Alaska and North America.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra is the part of
the kundalini of the planet.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
whole tide of the snake

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
comes from Alaska going through
the Rocky Mountains, Central

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:84%
America, and ending in
the end of the Andes

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:84%
is Tierra del Fuego in
southern Argentina and Chile.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:84%
All this snake that is
going through the planet

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:44.600 align:middle line:84%
is the highest mountains,
and also the Ring of Fire,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.660 align:middle line:84%
where the information
of the Soffhir

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
was settled during the
whole civilizations,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and the places where the
humanity took the information

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
from the snake to understand
how to transform the reality.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So after the Soffhir,
came the Alithir.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:07.190 align:middle line:84%
The Alithir were the
angels of the sea.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:84%
They protected
the Pacific Ocean.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
So they were in the islands
all around the Pacific Ocean

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and the Indian Ocean, protecting
the knowledge of water.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
that were trying

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:84%
to hold information of
water, and to transform

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:90%
the DNA of humanity.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:84%
The Alithir are also known
as the Mu civilization.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization where
the ones that taught

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
humanity how to find the
truth in their bloods.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Nemnir were the
next one's coming.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Nemnir were the
giants of the Poles.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:84%
They were protecting
the ice, so they

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that in every ice
age, brought this information,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and hold this information for
humanity and for the world.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And after them the Aessir came.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
The Aessir is the name
with which I remember what

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:90%
you used to call the Annunaki.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They were son of the
snakes, but they were also

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.640 align:middle line:84%
part of other planets that were
destroyed during the evolution

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:90%
of our systems.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have this
planet anymore where

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:90%
they used to live.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And they came to this
planet, to the core

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:84%
of the heart of the snake,
which was Arabia, Iraq, Iran,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Oman, and all this
places of the Middle East

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
where the garden to
create humanity was built.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:10%
This is because it was
the heart of the snake,

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:10%
and also because a
lot of plateaus--

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:10%
Africa, Middle East,
Anatolia, Europe, and Asia--

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:10%
are pressing with all this
information geologically

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:10%
towards this tiny region.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:10%
So all this region has this
energy going to the river.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
This region was the one where
all the information of humanity

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.350 align:middle line:84%
was held through all the
snake, and the main pattern

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:90%
of the planet, what was Africa.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Africa is from the very
beginning of the planet,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:90%
the core of the flower of life.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Africa is
one of the spots where

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
all the humans and all the
living beings were born.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Because from there,
life comes up.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the process
of transformation of the planet

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
was held around
through the snake,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:84%
but the core of the flower
is in the middle of Africa.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
If we have the
body of the planet,

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
you will see that Egypt is one
of the most important places.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole energy
of the heart chakra,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:17.120 align:middle line:84%
the root chakra, the sacrum,
and the plexus are going there.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:10%
The whole planet,
even the Poles,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:10%
they were holding
this information,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:10%
creating this
interdimensional information.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
important by itself.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are not the
machines that work for itself.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
They don't work if we
don't go in, if we are not

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:90%
aligned with our own pyramids.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why many of
them aren't working.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:84%
They are like very
old technology.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They are like dead
in most of the cases.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So this happened
because we didn't

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
have maintenance on them.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing, is because we didn't

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.710 align:middle line:90%
have maintenance of ourselves.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can upload
or download information

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:84%
from a pyramid is if you
are able to handle that.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need to
understand that there are

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:90%
pyramids all around the world.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But until we then
activate our own pyramids

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
within, our own octahedron,
our own power from the heart,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:90%
our own chamber inside--

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.400 align:middle line:84%
if we don't find the darkness of
the void in the ninth dimension

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
within, we are not
going to be able to get

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
into the information that
goes through those pyramids

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.550 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's good
to know where they are.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It's good to know about
the structure they have,

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
the histories that
they have, which were

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.567 align:middle line:90%
very different from each other.

00:23:57.567 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing that they

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
have to teach
about themselves is

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that they reflected in
the architectural way

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:90%
what we have within.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So in order to activate
every pyramid in the world

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and become again like the
mirror towards the unity,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
you have first to
become your own pyramid.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the goal for
the future of humanity.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We need to become
our own technology,

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:84%
to be a line to the self to
go through every dimension.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, when
we realize who we are,

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
we can go to the pyramids, and
we can get in the pyramids,

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and say the most important
verve in the universe,

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:84%
we can bring all the information
from every dimension inside.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The most important
verve in the universe

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:90%
is when you realize who you are.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, I am farther
than your personality,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
farther than your body, than
your soul, than your spirit,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
when you realize that
the three of them

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.880 align:middle line:84%
are just the essence
of who you really are,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
when you get into the chamber
of a pyramid and you say I am,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:84%
the real I am, so you
connect the whole network

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.520 align:middle line:84%
of the eight dimensions here
on the three-dimensional world.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
