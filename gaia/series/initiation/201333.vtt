>> How was the Galactic
Confederation created?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will explore
the beginning of the Galactic

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Confederation and how this
group governs the galaxy

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and the human experiment.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
To understand the Confederation
and how it was created,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
we have to begin to understand
the awareness of one

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:90%
individual, of oneself.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.350 align:middle line:84%
When the universe
start to realize

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that it was able to create
beings from its own body

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and in the sixth dimension,
they were the architects

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
of that creation of that
development of every creature

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
of every being that could be the
eyes of the self to understand

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:90%
every way to see itself.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.130 align:middle line:84%
They realized that there was two
ways in which the consciousness

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:90%
would be aware of itself.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.200 align:middle line:10%
One would be the unconscious
and the other one

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:10%
would be the conscious.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:10%
In our planet, our societies
are not built by consciousness.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
They are built by
unconsciousness.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And what does it mean?

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
We do everything to
survive, not to transcend.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.430 align:middle line:84%
That means that
everything that we

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
have created as a society
in Earth is about to--

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
how we can do to survive to
be better to improve ourselves

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
but to keep all the
resources for us.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So because we are still so
bounded to eat and to drink,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:84%
of course, we needed to
have all the resources

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and to keep all the
resources as much time

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and as much quantity
as possible.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:10%
That made societies that divide
countries that divide kingdoms

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.680 align:middle line:10%
that organize a structure
that there is rulers

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.740 align:middle line:10%
and there is a king and there
is someone administrating

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:10%
all the resources.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And in the other hand,
we have the beings

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that recognize the
individual, the self.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So it became the awareness of
the individual, the beings,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
of the own self.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:10%
In the fifth and
the fourth dimension

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:10%
when they started to design
the system of awareness

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, they
needed to put this idea

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:10%
that at the moment that
every being and every group

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:10%
and every civilization could be
aware of who they really are,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:10%
they could now share that
information with others

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:10%
and try to make an
organization that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.110 align:middle line:10%
helps the whole body of
a planet, of a system,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:10%
of the galaxy, of the
universe to be aware of itself

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.832 align:middle line:10%
and to be organized in the
path towards consciousness.

00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
The first undoing this
process were the Pleiadians.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
They live more in
the fifth dimension

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.130 align:middle line:84%
than in the third dimension,
so they have the perspective

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:90%
of the subtle realities.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
can see everything.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
From the fifth
dimension, you can

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
see every process in the fourth
dimension and all evolution

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
patterns from the
third dimension.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were traveling

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
through all the galaxy,
reaching and searching

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:84%
for those unconscious
being that would

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
be evolving into fourth
and third dimension.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
To be aware of themselves like
civilizations like villages,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
cultures, languages, they
would develop themselves

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
to understand the universe.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.820 align:middle line:84%
When a conscious
species recognize

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
that they are the entire cell
that they inhabit the planet,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
they are now able to
resonate with others.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you become aware
of the entire body

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
you are part of,
what you recognized

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
is that you are vibrating
in the same level,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
so vibration is the
key to understand

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:90%
how they started to connect.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
When the whole planet thinks in
the same way that recognizing

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
every individual,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
so every self of the
planet recognized the power

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:84%
that they have in
the self which we

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
call a planet is like every
dot in a sphere connecting

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:90%
to the court.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
What we have is the
perfect harmony,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and that perfect
harmony resonates

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:84%
in vibration with
other cells around

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:84%
in other galaxies
in other systems

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:90%
that exactly resonates the same.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all because of vibration.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.580 align:middle line:84%
When they started
to resonate, they

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
could listen the same songs, the
same music from other planets

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:90%
doing exactly the same process.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And by vibration, they
start to travel through time

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth dimension.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So that is how they started
to talk through mind

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
with other planets
and they started

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
to create this bound
between all of them

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
that they were ready to
became the cells to awake

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.725 align:middle line:84%
the whole body that
we called the galaxy.

00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So what the
Pleiadian people were

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
doing was to go picking those
planets around the galaxy,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and when they reached them they
were sending the information

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:84%
from the fifth dimension to the
more aware beings in evolution

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
so they could feel the
path towards the self.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we started
to call the channeling

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
or receiving
information or listening

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:90%
to the voices of angels.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:90%
They were not angels.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They were Pleiadians talking
from the fifth dimension

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and saying to us that
we had a purpose,

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and our purpose
was to get united

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and to find ourselves
through the culture

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
through the civilization
and that we had a purpose

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:90%
to reach divine through matter.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were guiding
other species around the galaxy

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to evolve like putting a
light in the end of the tunnel

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:84%
so we would reach that
purpose of creating

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
these civilizations
that helped them

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to reach a proper way
of seeing the hope.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:10%
And the way they created
this is through the people

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:10%
in the third dimension.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
When they reached
the third dimension

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
in awareness and
evolution, planets

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.300 align:middle line:84%
like the ones in Arcturus,
the ones in Sirius

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
started to realize
that they reached

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:84%
this amount of evolution, this
amount of awareness of who they

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
are, and they recognized
that they are not

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
a species on a planet,
that they were the thoughts

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of the planet in blood.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So when they
recognized that, it's

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
the moment when the
civilization, the species,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
become the consciousness
of the planet.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's that moment when
the Pleiadian people start

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
those planets were

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.510 align:middle line:84%
able to be in this organization
that would help others

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:90%
to realize who they are.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's how in
the third dimension

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth dimension
from Sirius and Arcturus

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.024 align:middle line:90%
created the Confederation.

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So what they did with
the Confederation

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
was different levels
of organization.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.370 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension,
they had this idea

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of the circle of
nine lords of light

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and nine lords of darkness.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
The nine lords of
darkness were the ones

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
trying to rule the process
of the third dimension

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and every pattern that
we would need to evolve.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And the nine of
light, they would

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.530 align:middle line:84%
be the circle that is like a
fraternity of light workers

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that help to find the
purpose and the path

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:90%
through the third dimension.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The 18 of them were
representing the flower of life

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
and every cell in evolution
in the planet in every planet.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So from the fifth
dimension they were

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
working to have this idea
of how everything works

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and how everything
should be in harmony.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:10%
The main goal of
the Confederation

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:10%
is to be in harmony with all
the process of evolution.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:84%
If there was a planet that was
resonating in a wrong way, what

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
they would do was to bring
people to those planets

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
to make it resonate better
so the balance of the galaxy

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:90%
would be in harmony like music.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:84%
So what the third dimensional
beings of the Confederation did

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.206 align:middle line:84%
was to organize
something like the UN.

00:09:55.206 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The UN of the galaxy,
this Confederation

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
would be civilizations
in the third dimension

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that they would really travel
through space using time

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in this spaceship
that usually are

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.230 align:middle line:84%
like UFOs or spheres of light
that they were traveling

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
through time in every planet
and they had these meetings

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and reunions to
speak about how we

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:84%
should be holding this
harmony in the reach

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.871 align:middle line:90%
of the consciousness.

00:10:25.871 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
There were many species
part of the Confederation.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:10%
Many we don't know, that we
don't have a name for them.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The most important, of course,
were the Sirius people,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Orion people, and Arcturus,
Lyran, Pleiadian people.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Even though Pleiadian people are
not physical most of the time,

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:84%
they used to talk with
some of the leaders

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
of the Confederation,
and normally

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
what we know about the
Confederation is those

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:84%
who are more physical
or similar to us

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that they have these physical
shapes and they have cities,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
they have parliaments
so they could gather

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and they are more similar
to our structured health

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.740 align:middle line:84%
When I was living in Gludok,
I was once a watcher of one

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:90%
of those reunions.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
What I remember of
that reunion, it

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.035 align:middle line:84%
was the first time I remember
someone speaking about the Blue

00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Pearl.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Blue Pearl
was the Earth.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:10%
And the Earth was
called Anglusaha.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:10%
And this planet for
us was in the path

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:10%
of reaching the
perfect resonance.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So they were asking
themselves in that reunion

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
if we should accept these
beings, these mammals to be

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
part of the Confederation
or to prepare them

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to be part of the
Confederation, and I

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
remember most of them saying
no because for most of them,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
emotions were like an illness.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So humans have so many
emotions that they can only

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:90%
use it for electricity.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:84%
We have so much power and they
are so high level in vibration

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and not too much connected
to the third dimension

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that our laughs could make
them die by a heart attack.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
All the energy that
we create every day,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
it's for them to
enlight planets,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
to enlight their Sirius.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why some people
from the Confederation

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:84%
use us as batteries and
some others trust us

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
like potential beings
from the Confederation.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But they all share the same
because their Confederation

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.880 align:middle line:90%
is not someone--

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not good people
fighting bad people.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:84%
They are all together
trying to find the balance.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the
Confederation travels

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
through time, not space.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why they are in
the fourth dimension.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:10%
Mostly traveling through
the fourth dimension,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:10%
they can see the whole process
of evolution of every being

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:10%
so they can see what do we
need, what have we done,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:10%
what are we going to do.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So they have an idea
of their whole spectrum

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities,
but the only thing

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that decides which
possibility will be chosen

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:90%
is which vibration are you in.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Because the lines of time--

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of
time is according

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:90%
to your own level of vibration.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
If you vibrate higher, you
will be closer to the future.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have a very
lower, you will be closer

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to the past, so more structure.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why what they do to
see our process in evolution

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
every planet is to go to those
planets in the fourth dimension

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and to do like a scan to
the vibration of the planet

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
and to see how it's resonating
in every region; if it is not

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
harmonic, so they can see
that we are still in the past

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and working into
our own problems.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So they cannot help us
directly because we know that

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
the process of consciousness
is something that comes from

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.370 align:middle line:90%
within not from outside.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:10%
So that's why they cannot
be involved in our process

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:10%
of evolution.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
They just can watch
and observe, so that's

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
why there are many, many
beings observing our process.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:10%
And we can see them sometimes
in tiny spheres of light that

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:10%
goes through the skies or the
fields, and sometimes a few

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:10%
of them left some
messages in the field

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:10%
so we can have the codes of
some vibration or information

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:10%
that we need to work in
that specific moment.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So they use the portals to
send this geometrical messages

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
through time and
through vibration

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
so we could have some
tools, some keys.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:10%
And they just look into
our level of vibration

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:10%
how our checkers are working,
and they go from one planet

00:15:53.630 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:10%
to another one looking into
what our pulses of vibration

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:10%
in Earth, for
example, affects Mars

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:10%
or Jupiter or other planets
so they can see what

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:10%
size our magnetical vibration
is arriving to other planets,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:10%
and if we reach the entire
system, the solar system,

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:10%
and affecting the
sun, too, so that's

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:10%
when they have to take part
of the process of resonance.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:10%
So they are watching
us all the time,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:10%
and it's like if we are watching
ourselves from the future.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:10%
When the Galactic Confederation
sees the potential

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:10%
of every planet,
what they try to do

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:10%
is to teach us how to balance
our emotions because emotions

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:10%
are the main structure
and an energy that creates

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:10%
and that connects us all.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The waves of emotions are
like the waves of the sea,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:84%
of an ocean, so if that
ocean is unbalanced,

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:84%
then you have a really
bad time in the sea.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
So you are not able to
go through very quiet.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So you need to handle
the emotions in order

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:90%
to be balanced.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's not control emotions
because you cannot control

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.380 align:middle line:90%
the sea.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
You cannot control the oceans,
but you can learn how to sail

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%
on them.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
trying to do is

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
to teach this
evolving planet how

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
to sail on these
oceans of emotion

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:47.790 align:middle line:84%
so we could use
it in our purpose

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and not have them like
stones in the path,

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.040 align:middle line:84%
like something that doesn't
allow us to keep moving--

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:90%
keep going.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So the problem that
the Confederation has

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.470 align:middle line:84%
is that is not like here in
Earth that we have democracy.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:90%
And democracies-- those who--

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the biggest group
controls everything

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
even if you have a parliament,
but they are not like that.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
They have to be all in
balance, every one of them

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:90%
to make a decision.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it
takes a lot of time

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to make a decision
of one species.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why many of
the Confederation

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
don't want us to be part
of it because they are kind

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of afraid-- it's not afraid,
but it's kind of afraid

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.960 align:middle line:90%
of us being part of it.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Other ones don't want
we to be part of it

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.800 align:middle line:84%
because they need our energy to
keep going with their purposes.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And other parts they
are trying to teach us

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
how to balance that
emotions and that ability

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
create without limit.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So we could still give
energy to those other beings

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:84%
but also being aware
to keep our own energy

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and to be balanced
so Earth could

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.493 align:middle line:90%
be part of the Confederation.

00:19:11.493 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
For the people of Earth,
Sirius is like our other sun.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
We have our own sun,
but Sirius was always

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:90%
the guide of our sun.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we do in
our system is guided by them.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
mother star or as we

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:90%
call the sun the father star.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So both of them, the mother
and the father, and are--

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:84%
were always in connection
because Sirian people,

00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.430 align:middle line:84%
they had personal influence
and personal purposes

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.290 align:middle line:90%
in our system.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Because even if we are
not exactly the same,

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:10%
they had this idea
from the Confederation

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:10%
that this planet is one of
the most prepared planets

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:10%
to receive all the genetics
from the whole galaxy

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:10%
and to prepare every
species to be aware of who

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:10%
we are as a galaxy.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they had
this personal interest

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
in this planet, and they
are trying to guide us

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:84%
from since long time ago, and
humans and Sirians were really

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
attached at the beginning
of our civilizations.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
teaching us how

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to build the pyramids,
how to build the temples,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:90%
how to handle sound technology.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.420 align:middle line:10%
So they were our
teachers, the ones

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:10%
that help us to
understand the universe.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And also Earth is one of
the only points of an aware

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
planet in evolution that
you can see properly

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:90%
the Orion's portal.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why we were chosen
by the Confederation

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
to open the portal for
Orion here on Earth.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, we were
connected to the stars

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
by the concepts of reality
and through the beings

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:90%
of Confederation.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:84%
The ones that came
from other dimensions

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
like the fifth and
the sixth dimension

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
were the information
or the shapes

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
in which we could understand
the concepts of creation.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
In South America,
Viracocha; in Africa Ra;

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
in other countries
with different names,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:90%
we name the god of the sun.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the information
that it bring to us

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:90%
came into these shapes of gods.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we had
these kind of gods

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
with no human shape that
represented the concepts.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Normally all the
Confederation people

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that travels and work
with planets in evolution

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
usually are in the
fourth dimension,

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:28.030 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes they are
born in this planet

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
or in other planets
in a physical way.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:90%
There were many in the past.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:10%
There were lots of people
that came from other systems

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:42.560 align:middle line:10%
to help us to re-establish
the organization,

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:10%
to re-estabish the
idea of who we are,

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.250 align:middle line:10%
and to be aligned with the
consciousness of the system,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:10%
so the sun.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you are aligned with
the Earth and the Earth

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
as a consciousness is
aligned with the sun,

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:84%
so the sun is the
biggest antenna

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
from where the information
of Sirius come.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the
people and the souls that

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:84%
came from the sun came from the
systems of the Confederation

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
to help us to re-establish
their consciousness.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.870 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness of
the sun was called

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
in Atlantean times
the spirit vibrating,

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual vibration.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.785 align:middle line:84%
Spirit in ancient
times was the letter A,

00:23:26.785 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and the vibration was
the letter R, vibration

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness of mind.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we call
that consciousness R.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:10%
And all the Atlantean people
and the ancient people

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.620 align:middle line:10%
were aligned to the
light of the sun

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:10%
so we could use it as
an antenna to connect

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:10%
with Sirius and from
Sirius to the whole galaxy.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:10%
But when we lost the
connection with the sun

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.260 align:middle line:10%
and we start to
see it like a god,

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:10%
there were a few people
that came to Earth

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:10%
to try to re-establish
the consciousness of R

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:11.350 align:middle line:10%
again like Pakal, Manco
Capac, and Kukulkan

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:10%
would be one of
the representatives

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:10%
of the Confederation bringing
information of wisdom

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.330 align:middle line:10%
and the power of the
enlightment here on Earth.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.050 align:middle line:10%
One of the last undoing
it was Akhenaten.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:10%
Akhenaten was one
of the Sirian people

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.860 align:middle line:10%
that came straight and was
born here on this planet

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:10%
by Sirian genetics to
try to reunite the river

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:10%
Nile into the consciousness
of Atlantean time.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's why he took every
different perspective in which

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.710 align:middle line:84%
we divided the divine,
so what they called gods,

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and they-- and he
put them all together

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.620 align:middle line:84%
again in the consciousness
of R, which now,

00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
because of misunderstanding
in writing, we call Ra.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The name of Ra that we know now
is because in ancient times,

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.850 align:middle line:90%
we used to carve stones.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So to leave the
information in silicon,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:84%
we needed the information
carved in the stones.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:84%
So that writing was
easier from right

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:84%
to left because you
can use their tools

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:middle line:90%
to make better writing.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:84%
But when we use ink,
writing this way,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.150 align:middle line:84%
you can erase what
you are writing,

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.840 align:middle line:84%
so that's why we changed
it to from left to right.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, all the
name-- the ancient names

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
used to switch and
change from R to Ra.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:10%
The awareness of the sun
on Earth was named Ararat,

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:10%
and the region of the people
that brought that information

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:10%
from Sirius on Earth
is now a tiny region

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:10%
that once was big that was the
place of the people of the sun,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:10%
which is called Armenia.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:10%
And that is the pineal gland of
the information of the planet.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:84%
In the galaxy, we had this
organization like our bodies

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%
works like biologically.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So as everybody, we have
an immunological system.

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This immunological system
with the white cells,

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:84%
they are the lightworkers
in the fifth dimension.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth
dimension, they are

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
white brotherhood,

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and in the third
dimension, we call

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:84%
them the militia that are
the guardians of the galaxy.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:84%
These people are
what we can tell

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
military but in a
very different way.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
What they do is to go to the
places or people or beings that

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
are in different
vibrations and they are

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
like viruses off the system.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.060 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is to go
and with their own light,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:15.430 align:middle line:84%
they just hug them with
this very powerful energy

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and enlights the
vibration of the being,

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:90%
changing its resonance.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So we can think about them
like the police, the military,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
from the galaxy, but
they are not fighting.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
They are just switching the
vibration of the viruses.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:10%
They are so high in vibration
that they are only related

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.280 align:middle line:10%
to suns, to the lights.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So they came to the-- they
come to the physical worlds

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:84%
in the rays of light, and they
are also called the aspect

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine, which are
defending their sons so--

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and daughters.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So for Egyptian
people, for the--

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.940 align:middle line:84%
for Atlantean people,
the most similar being

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
in this planet that was
related to that energy of power

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom and change
in the vibration

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:90%
was in nature the lions.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And lions that are
female, they were

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
seen like these defenders
of Earth directly connected

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
with the sun, and
that's why they call not

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
only the consciousness of the
sun like it was Ra or Aten Ra,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.310 align:middle line:84%
but the feminine aspect
of it was Sekhmet.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:10%
Sekhmet was the
goddess or the aspect

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.450 align:middle line:10%
of the divine that represented
the power of change

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.600 align:middle line:10%
in realities from the
sun here on this planet.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they took
the image of the lions

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
to represent those beings that
came from the light of the sun

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
to defend and to enlight
the vibration of our planet.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.530 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
after Atlantis,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we tried to do Confederation
kind of structure of society

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.960 align:middle line:84%
where women were trying
to organize everything

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:84%
through circles,
circles of women

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that treat society
as sons and daughters

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.550 align:middle line:90%
not like people to rule.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
This kind of
organization help us

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to be more aware of our
connection with the planet

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and to be more aligned
with the potential of ever

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:35.630 align:middle line:84%
being because the circle
of women used to see this--

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
the population all the
people like these kids

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to grow
up and to be better,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:84%
so they were teaching
how to be better

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:90%
and how to improve themselves.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why they treat everyone
like sons and daughters.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has worth to say
something-- something to share

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
but it was difficult
when the weather changed

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
food for everyone.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And we began to need a
new organization that

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
would keep our resources,
and it changed everything.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.740 align:middle line:10%
But today we are awakening
again this concept

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:10%
of the Confederation when
we see after the wars

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:10%
that we are trying to make this
globalization of consciousness

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:10%
that every country is sharing
information with every country.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And like European
Union, the UN, they

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:84%
are trying to emulate
their Confederation,

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:84%
but we are still
working as ancient times

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:84%
with presidents and
representatives.

So it won't be
long until we start

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
to reach the tools
to be represented

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.360 align:middle line:84%
by ourselves and not by
someone in the power,

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:04.340 align:middle line:84%
but for that, we need to be
in the perfect resonance.
