>> How are time and space
portals used in the geometry

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:24.635 align:middle line:90%
of creation?

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore how time and space

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:10%
portals are created and how
they work in the universe.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
When the spiritual
mind of the universe

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
started to bend itself in order
to create the ether and all

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:84%
the energetical paths
and enlightenment

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.870 align:middle line:84%
of the process of ideas,
all the construction

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of this mental reality
starts to duplicate itself,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
like bend itself, into
different realities,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and to show the positive and
negative structure of the self.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
This combination of
mirrors, of ideas,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
of positive and negative
realities in the spiritual mind

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
start to create the channels
in which the connection

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
of the ideas is going to flow.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
This construction is what we
call the nodes of information,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and in the middle
we have the neurons

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:90%
that connect all this data.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
We have to imagine the
mind of the universe

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:90%
like we are in our brains.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
All this conjunction of
cells that we call neurons,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
connecting by positive and
negative flux of energy,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
transmitting data information as
bigger the network is created,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:90%
expands more information.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
So we needed more spirits,
more synapses, more connections

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
around, and from one
spot to another one,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
they would charge off all this
energy to see the reflections.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
This creates the idea
of a pattern that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
will storage information in
some dots of the universe

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and some of those
mirrors, and that spark

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.430 align:middle line:84%
of information going through
the lines of time and space,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
the structures that are created
by vibration that we call

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
the ether, and this energy
would move through these lines

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that we will call, like,
the path through evolution.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And the nodes would be the
points of transcendence

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.180 align:middle line:84%
This structure would be
created in the pattern

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:90%
of a tetrahedron.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:10%
Point A would be the
negative, the inside.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:10%
Point B would be the outside.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:10%
And then, we have
the point C, which

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:10%
would be the point to
observe all the path that you

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.310 align:middle line:10%
have done.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:10%
So from the point A to B,
you would express yourself.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:10%
To the point C, you would
experience everything.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:10%
And then you would have to
seek the other point, which

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:10%
is the fourth one, the
point D, which will show you

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:10%
the integration of the whole
pattern, everything that you

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:10%
have expressed in this pattern,
and then everything you have

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.440 align:middle line:10%
experienced in this pattern.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, you will
have another one

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to show you the reality
of the whole pattern.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, you go to the
core to create a new one.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:10%
So the three patterns
that create the experience

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:10%
and expression plus the one
creating the integration of all

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:10%
of it, they all meet
together in the core,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:10%
creating the transcendence.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
All the spirits begin with
this tetrahedron pattern,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:90%
with this shape.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
the main structure

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universe in which every
portal through time and space

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.910 align:middle line:90%
is created.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
When we have the main seed
of creation, what we do now

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is to multiply it by thousands
and millions of them,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
creating the patterns
around the creation.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:10%
And they multiply the process
into many and thousands

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:10%
of expressions, so every
spark, every period

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:10%
that was created from
the source could express,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:10%
could experience
this same pattern

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:10%
and transform this pattern
into other paths of evolution.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So the main seed started
to spread all these seeds

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:90%
to create more trees.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And all these trees would
create new universes,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:90%
new dimensions, new realities.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The main seed that contains the
pattern of our whole process

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
will create the statements
in which every being would

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:84%
be able to go from the
mind to the experience

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
in a physical form,
in a physical shape.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
That is why one of
the tetrahedrons that

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is created will also make
a path to the outside,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
creating a point A to point
B. So positive and negative

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
would create two tetrahedrons
spinning, creating

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:90%
this new path within.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And this new path within
would create the being.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
These two patterns would
create the cube outside itself.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And this cube would create
the new seed of creation,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:90%
what we call the octahedron.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
This octahedron will be
breathing and expressing itself

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.860 align:middle line:90%
into the icosahedron.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:10%
And the icosahedron
would express itself

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:10%
until we have the dodecahedron.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:10%
So these first five
structures of the universe

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:10%
gives us every one of the most
important steps of evolution

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:10%
and the storage of every
mirror and every information

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:10%
that we accomplish in evolution.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
This means that every node
of the geometrical structure

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
would represent a core of
surging energy and surging

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
reflections of the main spark.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And every one of the lines
that connects all this geometry

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
would be the
processes that we have

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
to take in order to have
all this amount of energy

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and information from the whole
perspective of time and space.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what we call a portal.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
A portal is the place where
all the connections and path

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
of evolution goes
through it and to it

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and are reflected in
between time and space.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Those are the spots that connect
the tetrahedron, octahedron,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
cube, icosahedron,
and dodecahedron

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.680 align:middle line:90%
in the same places.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Every shape of the
universe that is created

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
from these main
structures are connected

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
through those spots that
are the mirrors of reality.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:10%
This creates the main structure
through where the spirits

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:10%
can live and can experience
every reality even

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:10%
if they are light, dark, even
if they are ether or matter.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter in which part
of the universe you are.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:10%
All the portals
or all the paths,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:10%
all the lines that you
have to take to evolve

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:10%
are exactly the same in
different levels or vibrations.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
These different
paths will always

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
be the same ones in
different dimensions.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So even if you are lost
in these realities,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
you would see the portals
towards the connection

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:90%
of the main information.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So from the higher levels
of knowledge, of vibration,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
of connectivity in the
mind of the universe,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
you will find that these
main structures of geometry

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
we call the path

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:90%
or portals towards realities.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:84%
These portals bend
time and space.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So every one of the mirrors
that stores the information that

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
was reflected in the lines
in the path of geometry,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
they could be all together
connecting different paths.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So every being that
are taking those paths

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.140 align:middle line:84%
towards the evolution,
they could see each other

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
from different perspectives
in just one core.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
These mirrors start to
divide itself in many shapes

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:90%
through these portals.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So the portals start to be
reflected in many thousands

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
of sparks around the universe.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting just
one light or a candle

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
in this labyrinth
or hall of mirrors.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
As many dots you have in the
reality, many mirrors you have.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So the first light, the only
light in the whole labyrinth

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
is reflected in
many different ways.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the
structure to find how

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
every mirror, every pattern
that we call a portal

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
is a path towards the
first spark of the spirit.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Portals are the connection
between the synapses

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing really is real.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we know
is just a projection

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
of the sixth dimension
that was projected

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:84%
from the seventh dimension
that was projected

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
from the network in
the eighth dimension

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and the divine in
the ninth dimension.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:90%
So nothing really exists.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just a
projection hologram

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of these mirrors
that are reflecting

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:90%
the process of awareness.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.760 align:middle line:84%
All this network of
neurons in the mind

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, the only
thing that they are doing

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
is to put all the
energy that they

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
are storing from the
experiences in just one spot.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So this main pattern
will teach us

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
that all the paths
in the universe that

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.870 align:middle line:84%
are created that are
projected from the ether

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
to the material worlds
are all the structures

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
of the portals that reflect
every truth around us.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:10%
And if we find those portals
around the creation, what

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:10%
we could do is to see ourselves
reflected into many dimensions.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So all the projection
of the universe

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
are all portals that
reflect just one reality.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
everything that exists

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
is just like this Russian
doll in which you just open

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%
one reality and another one.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that you are a part

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:90%
of all of those other beings.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
That there's no separation
in the universe.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That every being you could know
in the universe-- archangels,

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:84%
angels, guides, high
masters, the ascended masters

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth dimension-- all the
beings that you could possibly

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
imagine are just a different
projection of yourself

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:90%
through portals.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the mirror
system of the universe.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you find a portal
in the planet in yourself

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, you
will reach the path

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:90%
towards every line of evolution.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So all the lines in the
structure of geometry

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
would be aligned
in just one spot.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:10%
And that means that
suddenly if you

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:10%
are the spot of a
tetrahedron, you

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:10%
will see three lines
coming from you.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:10%
So these three lines
coming from you,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:10%
you could know as future,
past, and present.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:10%
And this structure of
three lines coming from you

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:10%
could be three different lives--

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:10%
a life you had in the past,
a life you are having now,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:10%
and life you will
have in the future.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:10%
And the three of them
are a path of evolution

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:10%
that are charging
information to your heart.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:10%
And they are connected
to your heart.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you
reach this portal,

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and you are able to
see through the portal

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
all these times and spaces that
are projecting from yourself,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
you are able not only
to see those realities,

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
but also to travel
through those realities.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
The portals are the realities
that connects every dimension.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So when the time and
space of every dimension

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.870 align:middle line:84%
bends itself to create
all the path of evolution

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
into one idea, all this
process of one dimension

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
goes into another dimension,
like bending itself

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:84%
from within to outside, like
a flower growing from a plant

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and opening into
the other reality.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And then dying again to become
the minerals that the plant

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:90%
needs to create more flowers.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
This pattern that goes out and
in, out and in in the core,

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
we have the information of
these lines filling with data

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:90%
to these portals.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So all these portals that
we created in the first time

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension, were
born from the five structures

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
that we know as the
platonic solids.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
These structures would
create the first patterns

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
towards opening the
other dimensions.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:10%
And from them, we would create
every shape and every portal

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.340 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why we also have these
projections in our stars.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Stars are the biggest
portals because everything

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
came from them, and
everything goes back to them.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:84%
All the information
of the experience

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and of the expression of
a star comes back to here

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
so it could be integrated
and transcended

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:84%
in another level
of consciousness.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:90%
So every star is a portal.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we have a
code in those stars,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:middle line:90%
we will find the constellations.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Constellations are
the other portals

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
that we can see in the
skies that allows us to go

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:90%
through one dimension to other.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The constellations are
the physical portals

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:90%
that we see in the universe.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And from the point
of view of Earth,

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
we have the positive
and negative

00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
of the portal in the physical
way of light through the stars.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
When you see the stars, you
are seeing the positive energy

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, which is
the aspect that en-lights

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:90%
itself and creates the matter.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
But what allows
that matter to exist

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
is the network that is within,
so the negative aspect, which

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:90%
is the space between the stars.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
The positive aspect
of the portal

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
is the one that brings you to
this reality, to the expansion.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And the negative one, the
space between the stars

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.990 align:middle line:84%
is the one that takes
you to the core.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the space, the
black part of the sky at night,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
is the one bringing you to
the truth and not the stars.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
ancient people knew.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:10%
So they were not
counting the stars.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:10%
They would count the
spaces between the stars

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:10%
so they could see and reach
the core of their reality.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
That is why we have positive
and a negative aspects

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:06.190 align:middle line:84%
in the universe-- the one going
within, the one going outside.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So physically, we have the idea
that the stars are guiding us

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to the light.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
And the space between is
taking us to the dark.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But from the perspective
of a fifth dimension,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:90%
it's totally opposite.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
It's like having a photograph
but in the negative.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
We can see the whole
space like light

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and the dark spots are the
doors that we call stars.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
This is how we see the universe
in the fifth dimension.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And from the third
dimension, we can

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
see the light in the portals
and the negative structure

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that holds the reality
in the dark spot.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
When a civilization starts to
grow and realize about itself

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
being a part of time and space
and being bounded by time

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and space, they realized that
if they connect their own heart

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
with the heart of the
star, what they would reach

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
was to open a portal
through the doors of reality

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
so they could go
inside these realities

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:90%
and travel through time.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
That is why most of the aware
beings in the galaxy, they

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:90%
don't travel through space.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
They just go to the
portals of reality.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
They open this
portal by vibration.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
And they just go inside of it.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
they can see, touch,

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and talk with every dimension.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Every reality in
the universe has

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
a portal within that
you feel, that you see.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Every reality that is around
you is created through a portal.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And this main portal
that is within, for us,

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
it is in our heart.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
These main portal holds a
whole pattern of holograms

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:90%
that create us from this spark.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:10%
Every line that we
have in our bodies

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:10%
are bounded and
created by this portal.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:10%
So everything, every
cell, every being

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.700 align:middle line:10%
has a portal through
where you can

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:10%
connect with every dimension.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why not
only the portals

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
are in the stars and the
systems in the galaxy.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But they are also even in our
houses, in our own bodies.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Whenever you are ready
to contact those portals,

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:44.100 align:middle line:10%
you can talk, listen, the higher
beings from other dimensions.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
When you start to listen,
your higher self, your guides,

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
your archangels, angels, other
beings from other dimensions,

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not because they are
trying to contact you.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It's because you got the
amount of energy needed

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:90%
to open a portal within you.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And that makes you
feel and listen

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
the truth that is in other
levels of consciousness

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
That is why usually we
feel, listen, and remember

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions and
the information

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.388 align:middle line:84%
from other levels of the
universe through the heart

00:20:19.388 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
and not through the mind.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, we have many
portals because a sphere

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:84%
has the perspective to see
and open every portal around.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We have the ethereal portals
and also the physical ones.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:10%
The ethereal ones
modify the matter

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:10%
so the matter has the
portals in its own structure.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:10%
We can find these portals
around our planet.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
highest mountains,

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
in some islands lost in
the middle of the ocean,

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of the
plateaus of every continent.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So all the realities
that we know,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
every continent that
is created, is just

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:84%
a projection from the
hologram of these portals

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%
from other dimensions.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures tried
to reach those portals

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and use the information
through the lines that

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
connect these portals and
align the portals of Earth

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
with the portals of the
galaxy in the constellations.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
That is why they tried to look
for the energy of the planet

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of every portal in the planet,
build the structures to hold

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.580 align:middle line:84%
the energy and to harvest the
energy of the planet aligned

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:90%
with the portals of the stars.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
That is why the
stars were built here

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:84%
as pyramids with the shapes
of the portals of the stars,

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
but using the energy of
the portals from the Earth.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
These would open the doors
in between every dimension

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
here in the third dimension
and also in the ethereal ones.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.660 align:middle line:84%
These two connections
with the network

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
around are the structures that
created the main connection

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:90%
to the mind of God.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So when we realized that
everything was connected

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:84%
through these five
shapes, and the portals

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
were the nodes where all
the lines of the geometry

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.720 align:middle line:84%
were connecting, so we realized
that they were the mirrors

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:84%
to see ourselves in
different dimensions.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:10%
We realized that in order to
travel to different dimensions,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:10%
we needed to see
ourselves within.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was this
projection that

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
helped every species to
travel through time and space.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Those species that were not
aligned with the self that they

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
had not alignment
with the heart chakra,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
they were not able to go through
these portals because they

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:84%
cannot connect with every
line-time of space and time.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was nature itself
prohibiting and banning

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
some species from going
through the portals

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
by the vibration
they had itself.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:10%
This is like the labyrinth of
the universe protecting itself

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:10%
from the evil, protecting
itself from the destruction

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:10%
of the same systems.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.820 align:middle line:10%
So whoever is not aligned
with the heart chakra it's not

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:10%
aligned with the portals
of time and space

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:10%
and the only reason why the
heart chakra is the only one

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:10%
is because everything
in the universe

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:10%
is connected by the heartbeat.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
universe is a pulse

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that has a rhythm
through time that goes

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:90%
through the vibration of space.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So whoever is not connected
with the pulse and rhythm from

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
the heart cannot go through
all these lines and all these

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:90%
portals.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:01.100 align:middle line:84%
That is why the
structures of the portals

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:84%
push us to be created, to be
molded by personalities that--

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:84%
with information of
all these portals.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The constellations
surrounding us

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:84%
are molding us so we can
work harder and to find

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
this perfect vibration
and perfect rhythm

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:90%
through the heart.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So that was the main goal
of our civilizations,

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to find the beat of the
heart, to find the clock that

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:84%
helps us to find the
perfect amount of frequency

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:90%
to go through these portals.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:10%
Whoever reached the
portal of the heart

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.740 align:middle line:10%
can reach every portal
and go through every spot

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:10%
in every geometry in
the universe finding

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:10%
the first spark, which is
the self, which is God.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Right now for humans, it's
important to understand

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
how this works, how the
universe is connected

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
through these portals of reality
because the planet is trying

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
to connect itself with the self,
with the understanding of who

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:10%
And that means that
we, its neurons,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.320 align:middle line:10%
are more wide open
right now by vibration,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:10%
by frequency to be contacting
beings from other spheres,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:10%
from other cells,
from other bubbles.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
each one of us

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
are opening portals
within to listen

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:84%
to voices of our self
in different realities.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:10%
And we have been 12,000
years disconnected

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:10%
from those spheres, so
it's important for us

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:10%
to know how the
portals of the universe

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:10%
work so we could
understand that we are

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.670 align:middle line:10%
the conjunction of
the time and space;

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:10%
that we are our own portals
and that if we open our heart

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.260 align:middle line:10%
chakra, we would be allowing
the download of the information

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:10%
of every dimension
that we call realms,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:10%
but that really is ourselves
in different dimensions.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you
need to understand

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that there are no higher
beings apart from you.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:84%
That every being in the
universe is just a shape of you,

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.180 align:middle line:90%
another vibration of you.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.462 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.462 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.690 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will uncover

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
how the time and space
portals in our galaxy

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:90%
created assorted star systems.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:90%
