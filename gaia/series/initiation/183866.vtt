00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> How were time
and space created?

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,
Matias De Stefano.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I am going to
explain how time and space were

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:10%
created, the nature of
duality, and the forces that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.408 align:middle line:10%
come from that.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.692 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
When we, as In-Na
people, were taught

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.330 align:middle line:84%
about the universe
and every dimension,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
at first, a lot of us
thought that duality

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most horrible
things that could possibly

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
happen, because we
are, like, trapped

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in this positive and
negative existence.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But when we realized what was
the nature of the creation

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
of duality, we knew that
without that, nothing

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:90%
could possibly exist.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Unity is the first
reality that exists,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
is the first and
the only statement

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that you could go through
the truth and the reality.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about that--
when you think about unity,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:84%
you could see everything
in the universe.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot
experience anything.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We used to talk about
unity as one librarian that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
had read every book in
a library but had never

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
lived any experience that
was written in those books.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So there was a moment
that that librarian

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
stood in front of
a mirror and said,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
what if I create
another reality, where

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I could live every
possibility that I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:90%
was reading in those books?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
So there comes duality.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Duality will be when the
unity asks the question,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.244 align:middle line:90%
what can I become?

00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:38.618 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Through that question,
a projection of the self

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.680 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you
can see yourself

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
from a different perspective.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.630 align:middle line:84%
This other side
of seeing yourself

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see a
different way in which you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:90%
can move through the reality.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So the self in the center
splits in two and from that two,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.070 align:middle line:90%
create two forces.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:90%
One is what we call the purpose.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
what we call the mission.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Purpose is the positive
energy in the universe.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And mission is a negative
energy in the universe.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are like waves of
just oneself dividing in two

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and then start to roll
in between of them.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And they never
stop to rotating--

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
one around the other one,
one around the other one,

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
creating different waves,
in different perspectives,

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a dance
in which the self tried

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to see every different aspect
of itself in a different way.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:90%
So they have to move.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But when one of them
moves, the other one

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:90%
moves into the other direction.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So they are opposite
all the time.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And they are trying
all the time to see

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:90%
the back of the other one.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So they start to split
more and more and more

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
in many other levels
and many other waves.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So duality starts to become
the positive and the negative.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Ever being in the
universe since that moment

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
is a creation from that
positive and negative energy.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
We, in our planet, and
in many other planets

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:90%
had not word for good and bad.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
We all the time
called the positive

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and the negative forces.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And the better way to understand
how these two forces work

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
is if you have in
the room a light.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And you put yourself
in the center.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:84%
As closest you get to the
light, the shadow behind you

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:90%
will be bigger.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So the darkness is
surrounding you.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And as close as you get to the
main point of light, which is

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.430 align:middle line:90%
the purpose you had, the goal--

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
to touch the other
perspective of yourself--

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:90%
darkness will go all around you.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
The light and the darkness
were just projections.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only way you can
see both as a creation

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is in the center.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go through light or you
go through dark, one of those

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:90%
will embrace you.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, you will be lost
in one of those perspectives.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So you have all this two
forces to create realities.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you move
towards one of them

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're lost in one
of them, the universe

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:90%
will hit you from behind.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why to
one of those forces

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
we call the negative and the
bad energies of the universe.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
The bad energies of
the universe are just

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:84%
your own shadows
trying to remember you

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:90%
that you are out of your way.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
When everything
is going bad, when

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
the whole forces
of the universe is

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.330 align:middle line:84%
telling you is this
is not your way

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly
everything goes down,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not because there is a
bad force in the universe.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It's because you were so
far away from yourself

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that that energy that
we call the mission

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
is pulling you back.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can find
your center again.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.900 align:middle line:90%
The only reality is unity.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why you cannot go towards
one of those perspectives,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.230 align:middle line:90%
because they are not true.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.150 align:middle line:84%
They are just a
perspective to see yourself

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:90%
from another dimension.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.520 align:middle line:10%
So the duality is a
dimension of creation,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:10%
is the force that allows you
to create a lot of realities.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So the self can see different
perspectives from itself.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So negative and positive
are the two energies

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
that pulls out from the core,
from the unity, pulls out

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:90%
all the energy.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So we can have this
movement, this dance.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And in this dance,
the unity start

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:90%
to create, like, a spiral.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And this spiral
moves all the energy

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
from dark to light,
from dark to light,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
creating this network of energy
around the whole universe

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that we call vibrations
and frequencies.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So all reality we
live in is created

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:90%
by positive and negative.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And you should not
go to one of them,

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:84%
because if you
choose one of them,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
you are just pushing yourself
to the edge of a reality.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And you are pushing yourself
to destroy yourself.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
There is no good and
bad in the universe.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:90%
There is only neutrality.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And neutrality needs both
to establish the creation

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:90%
once and again.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:84%
In duality, we have this
law, which is everything

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:90%
is evolving all the time.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is stable.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is always the same.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
The only constant
in the universe

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
is that everything
is unconstant,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that everything is moving
and transforming itself.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So we believed, as humans, that
if we are stable, we are good.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:90%
We have a good job.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:90%
We have a good partners.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:90%
We have a good life.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.650 align:middle line:90%
So I'm stable.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:90%
But that's illness.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
When you get stabilized
in your life,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
suddenly something
happens that push you

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:90%
outside your comfortable life.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can find a different
perspective of yourself.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:90%
We call that crisis.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:84%
But crises are good for the
universe, because pushed you

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:90%
towards evolution.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So we need the dark forces
and light forces all the time.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:90%
So we can evolve.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
We cannot choose
just one of them.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
The only way we can
possibly live in balance

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is exactly that-- if we have the
same forces and the same amount

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.945 align:middle line:90%
of energy of both.

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The first things
that were created

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
in the universe as duality was
the projection of a purpose.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:90%
The self is just in one spot.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So in order to go
forward to find itself,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:90%
it needed to project a goal.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And that projection was
to take a part of it

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:90%
from within to outside.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And we call it the purpose.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:90%
There is where we go--

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.410 align:middle line:90%
a purpose.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a projection, a hologram.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
But we need it to create.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So we created purpose,
which we call the positive.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And opposite to that,
we created the mission,

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:90%
which is in the back.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The mission is the one
that pushed us all the time

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.040 align:middle line:90%
towards the purpose.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And what it pushed us from
behind is the darkness,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:90%
is the negative.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
The negative also-- as humans,
we call it the feminine.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.870 align:middle line:90%
The feminine energy is not bad.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the womb.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the womb, where
we create our reality.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can
create new realities

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:90%
is when you close your eyes.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:90%
You go to the darkness.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And you just imagine
every possibility.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine
energy is the positive.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
When you have created
every possibility,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:90%
you says, I choose this one.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And you go for it.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's the masculine energy,
which is not male and female.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It's creation and destruction.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
these two forces,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the waves of the universe start
to move from the low vibration

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
to the high vibration.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And this perspective of the
universe and this energy moving

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
around from the positive and
negative, positive and negative

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
start to wave what we
call the network of time.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:84%
The network of time is
one of the perspective

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of the second dimension.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.930 align:middle line:84%
The second dimension is built
in base of time and space.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Time is this
negative energy that

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
holds us all in this
darkness reality that

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:84%
projects every possibility
of creation, of experiences.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And that holds us
all in just one spot.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:84%
This spot is projected
in many, many, many ways

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:84%
of seeing it from
different timelines.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, those
timelines condition

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the spot to push itself to split
in two and create the space.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So after the time start
to project outside,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
the space start to
project to every one

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
of those possibilities
in time and divide itself

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:90%
as many parts it possibly can.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So we, as beings, can experience
every time and every space.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So we used to believe that if
we are in the third dimension,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
we have come from
the second dimension.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have come from
the first dimension.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's
not like that.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
The second dimension tell
us that there was no time

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and space, that it is just a
perspective of the projection

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
of the reality.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So the second dimension
is not behind us.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:90%
It's surrounding us.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It is the-- are the
forces that create

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
every possibility
that we are living

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:90%
in every time and every space.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:39.810 align:middle line:84%
We, as In-Na people, in that
planet started to understand

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that every projection in
the universe outside of us--

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:84%
it was the darkness pushing us
towards our light and the light

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:90%
pushing us towards the dark.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the reality of the
universe in the third dimension

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
we are living in,
we usually believe

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.120 align:middle line:84%
that everything
that's outside is bad.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And everything is inside
is good and that everything

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is outside is pushing us
towards experiences that take us

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:90%
from our comfortable place.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So what In-Na people realize
was that if we as unity--

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
at the first dimension, we are
just projections from that.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:90%
We are projecting that reality.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So all this things that we have
outside, we also have within.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So what we will realize
is that we, inside,

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
have the same way of seeing it.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:90%
So we have two hands.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.505 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
hand of receiving

00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:90%
and the hand of giving.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we are
receive is energy from outside.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Then, we transform within.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And we give.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:90%
So this we call the negative.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:90%
And this we call the positive.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, they
knew that there

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.290 align:middle line:84%
was no projection outside,
that we could integrate

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%
more than we can inside.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So they stopped thinking
about the projection outside.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And they just thought about
the projection within.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We have the negative
and the positive.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is only
one place, where

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:84%
you can hold a neutrality
in between of them--

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.970 align:middle line:90%
here, your heart.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
started to understand

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that the creation
is not something

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:90%
that you just project outside.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that is all around,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:90%
in every time and every space.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:90%
We call that eternity.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:90%
You cannot fight eternity.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
You cannot fight
creation of eternity.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you
can create and you

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
can be in balance
without eternity

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:90%
is if you become that eternity.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So you may free him or her
or it of your perspective.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Why would that be?

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
There would be
unconditional love.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We used to call that,
as humans, all the time

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.100 align:middle line:90%
unconditional love.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really know
exactly what it means.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Unconditional is something
that has not condition.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So you are not able to love
really if you have a condition.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The first condition
is the projection.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So the first condition
is, I am here.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And you are there.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a condition.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
You cannot love the other
one if you don't realize that

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
it's yourself from
another perspective.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So unconditional and love--

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:90%
love means eternity.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Love is the wave
of time and space.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not loving others.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:90%
We also make that mistake.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So we think that loving
others is the only way

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:90%
to be in balance.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Loving others is loving
perspective from the self.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can
possibly love unconditionally

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:84%
is when you, in
coherence, love yourself.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:90%
It is the only way.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to love yourself
in every possible projection

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:90%
of the self.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
So what we were
taught about duality

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
is that you have to
know that you live

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:90%
in every time and every space.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you love yourself,
you will love yourself

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:90%
in every time and every space.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And we do this so
the ways that you

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
project of that center,
of that core creates

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:90%
a wave that goes and goes back.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes balance
in the creation.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We have also learned in
this past 2,000 years

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
that compassion is
one of the tools

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that we have to go through
unconditional love.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And compassion is not
to have pity of someone.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:90%
We usually make that mistake.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is a word
that comes to be

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:90%
passionate about something.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:90%
That's the origin of the word.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
passionate of creation.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So you have to share
the passion of creation.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is to share
the happiness of creation.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Because of Christianity, we have
this thought that compassion

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:90%
is to help others.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But others are a
projection of yourself.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
you can help others

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:84%
is if you are in your
core, in your balance.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And you are coherent
with yourself.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, by your
act, being just you,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
you are sharing that
passion with the others.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So others can wake up and
see that you are fine,

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:84%
because of you
are in the center.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I used to explain this
compassion like the trees does.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Trees are trees.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And they don't bend to help
other trees that fell down.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:90%
They don't help others to go up.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:90%
Trees hold itself.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And when someone fall down,
they share all the energy.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So they can transform
from that experience.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So in this perspective
of duality,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.090 align:middle line:84%
compassion is to share
the passion of creation,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
is to be aware and
to be able to share

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
how you feel about yourself,
how you feel about your balance.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We are heading to the duality
of creation, not separation.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
most important things

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that I think we have
to learn about duality.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Duality is not something bad.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:90%
Duality is creation.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
In the universe, we
have this knowledge

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that duality is the only way
you can create new realities

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and that we all are bounded
by the second dimension

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:90%
in between time and space.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you are part
of the third dimension,

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:90%
you see a third possibility.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when
you are just connected

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
to one of those possibilities,
of those three possibilities,

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:90%
you forget the duality.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And you start to think that
this duality is something

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that hurts you and
that it doesn't

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:90%
allow you to go forward.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's when the time
in the second dimension

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
creates the time in the
third dimension-- what we

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:90%
call future, present, and past.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years
ago, we were taught

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that the only life
that we have is this.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we do good now, we
can go to Heaven or go to hell.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So when we did that, we said
that duality, Heaven on Earth,

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
is bad, because
one of that is bad,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.800 align:middle line:84%
because we are in the
center, in the present.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But someone taught us
that the only possible way

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:55.290 align:middle line:84%
to go out of this reality
is going to work light.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
something spiritual.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:90%
This is something biological.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We all-- in a planet
that has just one sun,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity to
have light just 12 hours a day.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
We thought, because
we were trying

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to survive in this really
chaotic world, that darkness

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:84%
was bad, because
animals were killing us.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:90%
And someone could attack us.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So light was good,
because we were

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:84%
able to see and to
defend ourselves.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So we created long
pattern in the history

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:90%
that darkness was bad.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And light was good.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:84%
When we did that and we just
thought that has this only life

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:84%
to survive, and then when we
created the idea of Heaven,

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
we say it must be light, of
course, because light is good.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So we created a Heaven with
a lot of light and hell

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of darkness.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just biological,
not spiritual.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So when we did that, we
split the universe in two.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And we said one of
those two is bad.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:90%
And one of those is good.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
to the good one.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
delete the bad one.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:10%
That at the time of humanity, we
were all connected with duality

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.840 align:middle line:10%
as creation--

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:10%
we split in between
men that were trying

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:10%
to achieve the purpose of
light, which was knowledge

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:10%
and the women that were
in the caves working

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:10%
by night with the ceremonies
of the moon, which were working

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.670 align:middle line:10%
for wisdom--

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:10%
knowledge and wisdom.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So we split that knowledge
to have different perspective

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:90%
of the same reality.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:90%
But suddenly, when we said, OK.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Light is good.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:90%
So men is good.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And if dark is
bad, so every women

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that is gathering by night
to have these ceremonies

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:90%
must be bad.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So like, 4,000 years
ago, we started

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to split humanity in
between the good ones that

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.640 align:middle line:84%
were men and the bad
ones that were women.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But this is because we
disconnect ourselves

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.750 align:middle line:90%
from the universe.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And we start to connect
just with the feeling

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:90%
of surviving in this only life.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
understand duality,

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
we will realize
that every person

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that we meet in our lives is
just a mirror of ourselves.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
a big mirror that

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
has split in many, many,
many thousands of pieces.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Every reflection that
you see in your life

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is telling you something
about yourself.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So don't see the others
with the judgment.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Just see what the
judgment is inside of you.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can
learn a new thing

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:90%
about you because of duality.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
