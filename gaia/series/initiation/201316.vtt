00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are Sirius and Orion
the fathers and mothers

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of civilization?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.935 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore these constellations

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:10%
and the species that inhabit
these powerful portals.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Once Elohim created the
portals through time

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
so they could create
the matter and they

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
could define the
path of evolutions

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
in the three-dimensional worlds.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
They needed, in this
process of evolution,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:84%
people who could
be able to handle

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
the process of consciousness
in physical worlds.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:10%
So we had these planets, like
the Pleiadian planets, Vega,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:10%
and Lyrans, that they
were more subtle,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:10%
and they were connected
to the fourth, the fifth,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:10%
and sixth dimension through
their way of thinking,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:10%
their way of living.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But the Elohim
needed civilizations

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:84%
like in a middle
point, in between those

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:84%
who were built to survive in the
third dimension and those who

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:84%
were built to live in
the fourth dimension,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
to be in touch with them
in between dimensions.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.610 align:middle line:10%
So the middle point in which
the subtle beings and the more

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:10%
dense civilizations
were found in the middle

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:10%
was Sirius and Orion.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Orion was the
portal through which

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
all the beings in the
darkness and the light

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:90%
could meet in the same spot.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And Sirius would be
that constellation

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and that star that
helped everyone

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to understand their
purpose in the galaxy.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
In Atlantis, Khefislion,
the Sirian people

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:84%
were seen like the
architects of the universe,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
like the representative
of the Elohim in matter.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So Atlanteans kind
of thought that they

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
were the living
beings that could

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:90%
talk with the sixth dimension.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, for
Atlantean people,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
they were the guides to create
the civilization, to create

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:90%
everything that we know.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And Orion was the
portal towards we

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.490 align:middle line:90%
could reach every information.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So for us, the Sirian people was
the builders of the libraries

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Orion people
were opening the doors

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:90%
so we could reach every book.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.870 align:middle line:10%
That was the Atlantean way of
understanding and connecting

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:10%
with those portals.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.660 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantean times, we never
thought that they were gods.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:10%
We thought that they
were the reflection

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:10%
of a higher self with whom
we were not able to talk to.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So they were like guides, they
were like masters, mothers,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.241 align:middle line:90%
fathers, and our ancestors.

00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:50.127 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:10%
My soul is really
bounded to Sirius

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:10%
because I lived in
two of its planets.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.870 align:middle line:10%
The first one I was
born to is a planet

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:10%
I remember with the name Eimpah.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:10%
Eimpah was a planet
with many moons.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:10%
And the system of the
planet was amphibious,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.140 align:middle line:10%
because all the planet
was water and there

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:10%
were just a few islands.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And those islands were covered
by water half of the year,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and other half of the
year, they were, again,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
out because of one
big moon that was

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
pulling all the water from
one side of the planet

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:90%
to another one.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So this changing constantly
the weather and the structure

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:90%
in which we used to live.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So we live half of the year
outside the water and half

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:90%
of the year inside the water.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And all our cities
were like tunnels,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and they were
inside the mountains

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and inside the plains.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And they had these weird
like structures with membrane

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.490 align:middle line:84%
so the water could come in
in just the places where

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
we were allowed to go, and
all the beings that were not

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.730 align:middle line:84%
able to be inside the water,
they went to the highest hills.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:90%
They were not like big cities.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
They were like small
towns all over around,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and connected by
tunnels underground.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We had this frog face
with four horns back.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And our brain was divided
in four parts in the head.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And we used to connect
by vibrating the brain.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So in the water, we could
communicate it like sonar.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And we had these membranes
in our hands and feet

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:90%
so we could go in the water.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And all our structure
of society, civilization

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
was like ants going under
the ground and on the sea.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And we were bounded by
our responsibilities.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So we were not like families.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:90%
We were born in eggs.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And there were
circles of wise people

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that they were deciding
the destiny of every egg

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and the destiny of every
being in the planet.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
They decided which
eggs were going

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to which cluster of people so we
could be in the same resonance

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and in the same level
of evolution with them.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:10%
So it was kind of society
deciding where you

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:10%
are going to have your family.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Because of half
of the year we had

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
no water in the main
islands, we harvest

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:84%
some fruits and some
other roots to have

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
food for the rest of the
year when the water comes.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So we were harvesting,
and we used

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to walk like
gorillas or monkeys.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:84%
We were not very good on walking
on the ground, because we

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:90%
were not meant to be there.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of the year, when
the water came to the island,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
we spent most of the
time in the water.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So we were swimming like a
mermaid and shaped with a frog.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Our culture was very
related to the moons.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We were called the planet
with 1,000 satellites

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:84%
because we had these rings
like Saturn, a big moon that

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
was crushed, and all the parts
were going around the planet.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So our culture was
bounded to the spirits

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:90%
of the lights of those moons.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And we had two tiny
suns very far away,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:90%
which is Sirius A and Sirius B.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And these two
sunrise and sunsets

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
make us have all the
time kind of light

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:84%
because the reflection
of the moons.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So all the world
was really awake,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
like all the emotional
thing was really out.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing to hide.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It was not like here in Earth.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
We had no emotions related to
mother or father or brothers

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
because everything
that we felt, it

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
was right there, right outside.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:10%
So our culture was very neutral,
in that sense, because there

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:10%
was nothing to hide.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:10%
In that planet
was the first time

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:10%
I experienced the big war,
how the Draconians started

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:10%
to invade some planets and to
take energy from our worlds.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
first planets where

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
I had to fight and to
defend our system because

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Draconians
trying to control us.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:90%
But we had not guns.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We had not anything
to defend ourselves.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:27.312 align:middle line:10%
We were just using our mouth
to take the heads of the enemy.

00:09:27.312 --> 00:09:30.784 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
The other planet I was
born in was Gludok.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:10%
And Gludok was one of the main
places where the confederation

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:10%
used to held some reunions.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:10%
Gludok has two big
continents and small seas.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:10%
And I was living outside what
we call the planetary capital

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.950 align:middle line:10%
Shiroda.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.950 align:middle line:84%
We had also two
suns, but closer.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest one
was our main sun.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
We also had two sunrise and two
sunsets, and only five moons.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest part
of the continent

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
was like desert and stones, and
a few forest in some places.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And our culture,
our civilization

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
was one of the founders
of the confederation.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:10%
This means that that planet with
other planets from the galaxy

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:10%
were the founders of the first
civilizations in the galaxy.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And they knew how to put all
the spheres of other dimensions

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:90%
and build them on planets.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why they designed
the main structure of how

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
a civilization works,
because we figure out

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that the most accurate
system in the whole galaxy,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:84%
in the whole
universe was already

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:90%
designed by the universe.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was biological.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's why our entire
civilization and the way

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:84%
we imprint that our civilization
in the Galactic Federation

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
was in a biological way, in
the system how our body works.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The system of Sirius has
many planets, but two of them

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
are really inhabited and
one of them just a bit.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:10%
The main species of
Sirius are in Gludok,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:10%
and there are three of them,
three races of Gludokians,

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:10%
which we call the In-Na.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:10%
One of them lives in the
north, the other ones

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the planet,
and the other ones in the South.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
We had all the same
structure, which

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
was around two meters and a
half tall, and gray, brown,

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
and clear gray skin.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
These different skins
were the only thing

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that really differences the
races of the In-Na people.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:10%
But all of us had
the same head--

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:10%
big eyes, black eyes, and
a head in the conic shape.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
The conic shape has
three parts of our brain,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
two to understand this
reality, and other one

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:90%
to connect with other realities.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So we, the conehead
people, we were

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
able to talk through time
and space with other species.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:55.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we were chosen
to be the kind of rulers

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.725 align:middle line:10%
of the confederation.

00:12:57.725 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
When the Elohim needed to put
the spheres of other levels

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness on this
reality, they needed to express

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and compress all the data,
all the information in the way

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that, in the third
dimension, we could see it.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to use
these civilizations, like Orion

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and Sirius, to look
for a way to reach

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
the perfect way in
which the sphere could

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:90%
be built in this reality.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why these
two civilizations

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.010 align:middle line:90%
started to create the pyramids.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are not just
ups, they are also below.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And they create this
octahedron shape

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
that contains the sphere
in the ethereal world,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
but in the shape of
the material world.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:10%
That's why, once the Aessir,
the Soffhir, and Nemnir,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:10%
and Alithier started to seed
the information through blood,

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:10%
through vibration,
through DNA in our planet,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:10%
once they shaped
our way of thinking,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:10%
they shaped our connection with
the planet, with the stars.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And once they shaped our
way of seeing civilization,

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.310 align:middle line:10%
then when the Arcturians
prepared the humans

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:10%
to be the aligned beings
to have the power within

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:10%
and to prepare them to
awake all the inner power

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:10%
that they had, then the Sirian
people and Orion's people,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:10%
they came to our
planet to teach us

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:10%
how to build a proper
civilization so we

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:10%
could bring the spheres
of heaven here on Earth.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:10%
And that is why we
call the In-Na people

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:10%
the mother of civilization.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:10%
That's why we call them the ones
that brought the information

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:20.460 align:middle line:10%
to be who we are as empires,
as civilization, as the society

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:10%
that we have built
in Atlantean times.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The In-Na people
came here many times.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
They came to see the world
when the dinosaurs were here.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.190 align:middle line:10%
They were always taking care of
the evolution of this planet,

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:10%
like watching from above,
until the Arcturians created

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:10%
a species that they
were able to talk with--

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.735 align:middle line:10%
us, Homo sapien sapiens.

00:15:47.735 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They came to this planet, but
they never showed their face.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
They were always
covered with something,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
like kind of a
blanket, like a ghost.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And they used these
dresses so nobody could see

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.650 align:middle line:90%
their heads and their faces.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So they were treated
like gods, and they

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
had these hats with the
shape of a cone saying

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that that was the connection
with the universe.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:10%
So in history, we still
have these symbols.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.770 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity, Egypt,
Middle East, Asia,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
this is the symbol of
the priests, the symbol

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
of the kings and queens of
the history that were bounded

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.030 align:middle line:90%
to the mothers of civilization.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They were like politicians,
but in a different way.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
They came here to talk
only with the architects.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:10%
They would say that the
architecture was the key

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:10%
to understand how are our
societies should be built,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:10%
because the great mind of
the goddess in the universe

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:10%
was the great architect.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.319 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they taught how
to build societies according

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
to how they build
their houses, how

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:90%
they build their structures.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:10%
So that's why, in the very
beginning, they took the stones

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:10%
and they taught
people how to build

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:10%
the structures with rectangular
or cube-shape stones.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
They said that the shape
of a cube in a stone

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
would have the
imprint of the sphere,

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
so all the dimensions are
bounded in that shape.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't build a
big stone, a big circle,

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:90%
you have to build with a cube.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they start to
build columns with that shape,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
they start to build
houses with that shape.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And they created these
monuments to create spheres

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And these spheres
were populations

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and villages and
cities that were

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
built in three circles,
one smaller, the other one

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:84%
bigger, and the other one
surrounding the other ones.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is the main structure in
which all the towns were built

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
in the past so we could have
present, past, and future all

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
connected in once in the matter.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Atlantis
was built in that shape,

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
so we could have all
the times in one place.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
builder of the pyramids.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones that
talked to the architects,

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and talked to the
architects how to build

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of
the universe here,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and how to make our civilization
something that was divine.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's why every pyramid
you would see in the world,

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:84%
it was not built
by them, but it was

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:90%
guided how to do it by them.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The Sirian people
used to follow what

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
we call the conscious equator.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
equator was a line

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:84%
crossing from Peru, Rapa nui,
Cambodia, Pakistan, Iraq,

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, and the desert of
Sahara, and going to Green Cape,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:90%
and Brazil.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So that line that connects
the equator of consciousness

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
in the planet was
the one that they

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:90%
used to move around the planet.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:10%
So while the cultures
that are in that regions

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.640 align:middle line:10%
are the ones more connected
to the Sirian people.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, in the
desert, for example, we

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
have the Dogon
people in Sahara that

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
inherit their knowledge
of them, and how

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:84%
to build a self, a being
from the mother star.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And Egypt was one of the most
important civilizations that

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
built everything
according to the teachings

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:90%
of the In-Na people.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
When Atlantean civilization,
Khefislion ended,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:84%
all the sons and daughters
from civilization

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.280 align:middle line:84%
from Ekaron Island,
which is Canary Islands,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:90%
came to the Mediterranean Sea.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.770 align:middle line:10%
And they stopped in
Balearic Islands,

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.610 align:middle line:10%
then they stopped in
Corsica and Sardinia,

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:10%
and then Sicily, Crete,
then Cyprus, and from there,

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:10%
went to River Nile.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:10%
They brought the idea of
the mother civilization.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:10%
And the main priestess that
taught about the mother

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.510 align:middle line:10%
civilization was
the mother Isis.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And the mother Isis was
represented in the sky

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
by the star of the mother
civilization, which

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:90%
was the In-Na.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all the
civilization of Egypt and Khem

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:84%
civilization before Egypt were
built according to the mother,

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
according to Isis, and the
star that now we call Sirius.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, In-Na, the mother of
all civilizations on Earth,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:84%
they shaped the
idea of how to build

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:90%
the uterus of civilization.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why the structure,
the architecture

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
was bringing those
dimensions and the creation

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:84%
of the sixth dimension
here on Earth.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So they shaped
the idea of how we

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:84%
be able to create our own
path, our own evolution

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:90%
through consciousness.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
call it the mother.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
They were taking care of us.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:10%
But on the other hand, we
had the Orion civilization.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Orion has many cultures because
it's the most important portal.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
The two more important for
us are these two species,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:90%
in different worlds.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the
agricultors of the galaxy,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and the other ones
were the Seekers.

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
The agricultors of the
galaxy are the keepers

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.650 align:middle line:90%
of the seeds of DNA.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And they look for
planets to see where

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
they can put the
genetic material so they

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
can keep all information of the
galaxy in different planets.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like a bank of information.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We can see them like
with big eyes, big head,

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
similar to humans,
normally bald.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And they are dressed with
this platinum kind of dress.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And they used to
go over the galaxy

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
in these ships that
had the shape of a UFO

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:90%
that we all know.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And they travel the galaxy
through the fourth dimension

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:90%
with these machines that spin.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So they go inside
and bend the time

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:35.030 align:middle line:84%
so they can travel through
one planet to another.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:84%
The Keepers used to use
the Seekers to find worlds

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
where they could seed
all these seeds of DNA.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:84%
These Seekers were
looking for worlds.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And when the minerals and all
the resources of those worlds

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.780 align:middle line:84%
was ended, they seek
for another one.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there
were called the Seekers,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:90%
from our perspective.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So we, the Seeders, used
the Seekers to reach planets

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:90%
where to put that seeds.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:84%
When the Seekers
arrived to Earth,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
was guided by the Seeders,
because the Seeders

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
saw that Earth was able
to hold many seeds of DNA.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:30.300 align:middle line:10%
Humans used to call that
Seekers as Aessir or Annunaki.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:10%
And when they were
here, then the Seeders

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.220 align:middle line:10%
of the galaxy, the
agricultors, came to our world

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:10%
and started to seed
this information which

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:10%
was inside of each one of us.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:10%
And that's why they are the
fathers of civilization,

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:10%
because they brought
all information

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:10%
of every civilization and
they put it inside of us,

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:10%
inside of our mind,
inside our blood,

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:10%
and Sirius built the
structures that we

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:10%
call the uterus, the pyramids,
where you go in with the seed.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you create a being, a
superbeing, which is a human.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:90%

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
When I was living in Khem,
the colony of Atlantis,

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.750 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago, I
remember the Sirian people,

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
when they came to visit us,
it was something fascinating,

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:38.060 align:middle line:84%
but not like seeing a god,
but seeing a grandfather

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.010 align:middle line:84%
or grandmother that
you were expecting

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:90%
to see for a long time.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So they had no emotions.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
They just had this neutral
treatment, but it was sweet.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a weird sweetness
that they had with us,

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
like if we were kids.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So we were called
the young brothers.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
In that colony, we used to
call the people from Sirius

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and Orion our ancestors, our
grandfathers and grandmothers.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.710 align:middle line:90%
We had not this idea of gods.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:10%
The Atlanteans saw
them like partners

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:10%
in the construction
of a new civilization,

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:10%
because Atlantis knew
that the world, this world

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:10%
was being able to
evolve so fast,

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:10%
and that we were able to
reach an amount of energy

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.770 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness
really, really wide.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And the goal of Atlantis was
to show to Orions and Sirian

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
people that we were able to
be part of the confederation.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And for us, 2,000
years after that,

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, that was history.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
That was something that
we couldn't accomplish.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of work
to do before being

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:90%
part of the confederation.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
instead of seeing them

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
like partners in
this construction,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.680 align:middle line:84%
we saw them guides and
ancestors that wisely told us

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:90%
how to survive in this world.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the
Galactic Confederation

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and how they
governed the galaxy.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:10%
