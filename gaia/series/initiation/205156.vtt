00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The first time I was supposed
to remember and to understand

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:10%
who I was was when
I was 12 years old.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:84%
My guides told me
in seven days, I

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
would start to
remember other lives.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
That week, the first
memory I had was myself

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.480 align:middle line:84%
with the body of a
woman and the man who

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
was my husband in that life,
both of us asking for help

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and support there in the
basik, what we call now

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:90%
the great sphinx.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The first image I had
of my entire memories

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:84%
was being there, watching the
lion straight to the eyes,

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and asking the
basik, as we call it,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
for help to support myself in
everything that I had to do

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and that I wouldn't
be able to accomplish.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
From that memory,
from the emotion,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I started to remember
my country, Khem.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Around 2,000 years
after the Atlantean

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Empire began crumbling,
several colonies had formed.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I was living in the
major colony named Khem.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:10%
This colony was built around the
plan we call Ater Tumti, which

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:10%
means bring heaven on Earth.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
The main goal of
Khem was to create

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
a society built around an
initiated path along the Nile

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.350 align:middle line:84%
My name was Shiw, and I
completed the initiated path,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the most
intense challenges to test

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:84%
every cell of my body,
a series of 33 tests

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to transcend the limits
of the third dimension.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
This test was to prepare
you to become a key

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
to open and raise the harmonic
frequency of the planet Earth.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
To become an adilion,
which means those

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:90%
who are the elements of nature.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:84%
In this season, we
will dive deeper

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
into Atlantean
technology, discover

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
the origins of the gods and
goddesses from ancient Egypt,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
follow the path of initiation
through my memories of it,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and reveal how Khem
became one of the mother

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:90%
civilizations of the planet.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.149 align:middle line:90%

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:84%
How did the Atlanteans open
the natural portals on Earth?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will
explore the technology

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.767 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis civilization.

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of the universe,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:90%
time is not a structure.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:10%
Time is not a trinity of
past, present, and future,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:10%
but a process of
four stages which

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:10%
are experienced
as waves expanding

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:10%
through the universe
because of vibration.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:10%
The vibration moves faster or
slower, creating frequencies,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:10%
and those frequencies
are how time

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:10%
is expressed in the
third dimension,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.755 align:middle line:10%
as a colors of light spectrum.

00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
In the stories my
grandfather told me,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
there was two names that we had
to follow the whole universe

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:90%
and the whole existence.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:10%
The first name of
the universe was mhs,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:10%
M-H-S. M is the portal.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:90%
H, the time.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.585 align:middle line:90%
S, the space.

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And saham, the
mirror world to it.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
It was the space, the
time, and the portal.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:84%
The story of mhs and saham
was the story of all of us.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
It was how the
universe was created

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
from the portal from
within, and this portal

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:90%
opened the waves of time.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And these waves of
time started to create

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
the different synthesis in which
the matter would be created.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
The first story tells
about this god or goddess

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.345 align:middle line:84%
that started to breathe the
creation and saw every time.

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:04.145 align:middle line:90%
So, the future.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:07.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:84%
After that, he experienced
every present in that existence,

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and after that created
the structures to leave

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:90%
every one of those presents.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
So becomes the past.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The three times started to
create the patterns of matter,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
of reality, and create
the path towards the heart

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:90%
of the creation again.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why from the
beginning, we call M-H-S, mhs,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:90%
the creator from every portal.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And then every portal has to
go back through time and space

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to find itself in the
source of creation.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So when every being was created
in different dimensions,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:90%
they were created through time.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And time was the common
expression of every reality

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
until time, with all
its waves, started

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.690 align:middle line:84%
to create the
different vibrations

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and synthesis in which the
realities would be held.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So that created the matter
and all the civilizations

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
living in physical worlds.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
These physical worlds
started to create in space

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:90%
the codes of time.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Matter and space is
just the shapes of time.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
way in which it

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:90%
is expressed through vibration.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
In order to change the realities
in the three-dimensional space,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.090 align:middle line:84%
we have to become time,
transform ourselves

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:84%
in the dimensions of time so
we can have the information

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to know how to move realities
through the waves of time.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
changed realities

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:90%
is the concept of time.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.770 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that
for humans, time

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:84%
was just something
that happened,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that we called past,
present, and future.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But for every dimension,
it isn't like that.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
The time is not
something that happens.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It's something that vibrates.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
holds everything together

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and that transforms
constantly everything.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you are able to
transform yourself,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
it means that you
are able to handle

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the past, which are all the
structures that hold you,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.355 align:middle line:90%
that creates you.

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And you are able to
control the present

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
if you are able to go and
have free wisdom, free love,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:90%
and free will.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you are able to reach
the information in the future.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And reach information
in the future

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
is to be closer to the
source of the universe.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's totally opposite to
our way of seeing time.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not going backwards,
what takes you to the source.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to the
future what gets you

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
closer to the very beginning.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
What we realized
was that if we know

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
how to use the past information,
the tools of the geometry,

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
of vibration, we
would understand

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
how to handle our
present and get

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.310 align:middle line:84%
inside the information
of the future, which

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:84%
is the only time that could be
in every time possibly created.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Time travel was
not only physical,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:84%
because in order to
go into another time,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
you needed to be in resonance
with the same amount of energy.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:84%
That means that when
you travel through time,

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
mostly you are not going
physically to those places,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
but you are channeling
those places.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
The most aware consciousness and
civilizations from the galaxy

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
knew at that point
that the only way

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you can connect
with every space is

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
through those waves
of consciousness that

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
goes through the time.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
it's so difficult

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
to say in which moments happen
everything that happened

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
in every planet, because
the communications

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.690 align:middle line:84%
between the planets,
it's not through space.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:90%
It's through time.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:10%
That is why in the fourth
dimension, every species that

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:10%
created the concept
of the consciousness

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:10%
in their confederation,
they would

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:10%
look into all the
process of time,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:10%
and they could see every
process of every species

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:10%
from the very beginning to
the very end in just one spot.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
to focus on those parts

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and communicate with
them through time

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
so they could
recreate the creation

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and redo every pattern that
the universe was creating.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So that would help us to be
part of the conscious of god.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
That would make us like
god in a living shape.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Controlling time is controlling
the shapes of the matter,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and that is why we needed
the technology of sound

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand how
to transform this reality.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Every planet that we
know is in a process

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.030 align:middle line:90%
of unconscious evolution.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But when a planet starts
to be in a process

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of conscious
evolution, every planet

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
in the galactic
confederation that

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
are connected to
those waves of time

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:84%
knows and realized
that that planet is

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
willing to open the
portals so the mhs can

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:84%
get in the process of
evolution, so the beings

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
alive in that planet could
create the machines to go back

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:90%
to the saham.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Another way to understand
the saham and the mhs

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.460 align:middle line:84%
is to understand that mhs is
saying the question, am I?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And saham is saying, I am.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
When the universe knows that
it is, that it is a being,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the main clue that it has
to know itself in the path

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
through wisdom is to ask
and have doubt of who it is.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:10%
So when it has doubt,
it is to ask, am I this?

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Am I this?

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you already
exist in the world,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.740 align:middle line:84%
exist in the world,
what you will

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
do is to try to go
back to the self.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why we start
with the process of I.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:90%
So we need to discover who I am.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
process of saham

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
is discovered that I am a
part of the consciousness

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Every portal in
the conscious world

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
is like a breathing
being saying, am I?

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.415 align:middle line:90%
Am I?

00:12:03.415 --> 00:12:05.750 align:middle line:90%
I am, constantly.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So these 12 portals of every
sphere, in every reality,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:84%
is breathing constantly this
question and this answer.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them
has a different type

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
of vibration according
to the constellations

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
that they are looking at.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when
a planet starts

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of who
it is, it means

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that this matter, this
space is ready to go

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:90%
through the process of time.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It means that space
can control time.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
When we not only live
through the matter,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
but we can also
live through time

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
is when the planets
realize that time

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
is the most important energy
and most important information

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:90%
that you could ever handle.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.495 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
every civilization

00:12:59.495 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
in the confederation is
trying to control time,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.665 align:middle line:84%
because whoever controlled the
time controls all the creation.

00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:10%
So when Earth started to be
aware of who it is, what Earth

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:21.500 align:middle line:10%
did was to go to the
deepest part of evolution

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and to seek these
beings who were

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:10%
able to represent the
consciousness of the planet.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And then all the species
that came to Earth

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
was to prepare these beings that
became the humans to be aware

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
that they were the
physical shapes of time

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
in every dimension, that we are
the last product of that aware

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
being that is willing
to figure out who it is.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians came to
this planet to help

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to improve the way of thinking
about itself through changing

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of the blood.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Changing vibration of the
blood would improve the DNA,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
because the information,
the resonance of our blood

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
would accept all the
information from the stars.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So they were preparing
the bodies, the planet,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and the blood that
we have within

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:90%
to be aware of who we are.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.300 align:middle line:84%
When every family of
Atlantean civilization

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
started to split
around the world

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
because Arcturian people told
them to seek those places,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to reach those portals, what
they discovered traveling

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
around the world
was that every spot

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
was connected through the
structures of geometry.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
When they discovered the
mathematics in that geometry,

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.300 align:middle line:84%
they figured out
that every spot--

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
sacred spot in the
world was connected

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:84%
almost in the same distance,
one from each other.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered that the
whole structure of the planet

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
was just a structure of
geometry dividing itself

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.240 align:middle line:84%
in thousands and thousands
of billions of parts,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and that if you discover those
special spots in the planet,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
you could talk with any
atom in this planet.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.270 align:middle line:84%
When you get that
information as a human,

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:24.100 align:middle line:84%
you could hear and listen
the universe talking.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:84%
That power makes you
recognize that you

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
are able to be
part of everything

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that you know, everything
that you recognize,

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.240 align:middle line:84%
everything that you can touch,
feel, see, listen, smell.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And then is when you
come to this awareness

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
that if you can be
that reality, then

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
you can also transform
that reality.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was trying to
reach the knowledge within

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge of
the self by meditation,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.550 align:middle line:84%
by building these sound
machines with circles of stones,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
with these cities in the
shape of circles with water.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And water would help them
to communicate through time.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
When they discovered how they
could read water by frequency,

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
by vibration, and how
sound would be the language

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
to decode the structure
of the reality,

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
it was the time for Sirian
people to get into this plan

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and teach them how to build
civilizations according to what

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:90%
this planet needed to do.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the
confederation to do that

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was to allow bigger
synapses to contact

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:90%
the core of the reality.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, every
species, every planet

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
has their own way
to see the universe.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And as many conscious planets
we had in this galaxy,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:84%
the biggest mind we
have-- we can create,

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
and the closer we get to
the core of the creation

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:90%
to the future.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Geometry and architecture
were the main things

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.510 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to build
these machines to open

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:90%
the portals in this planet.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Sirian people taught
humans how to build

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
these structures, this geometry,
with the patterns of vibration.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
To make it easier
to carve the stones,

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.720 align:middle line:84%
they would use these pillars
of minerals called djeds.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.380 align:middle line:84%
These pillars held different
levels of vibration,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.990 align:middle line:84%
making it work
like a tuning fork.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.170 align:middle line:84%
It would direct a
powerful frequency

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
towards the stone to change
the vibration of the minerals

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:90%
within the stone.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
This modification
by vibration would

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
rearrange the structure of the
minerals on a quantum level.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Patterns of vibration,
the technology of sound,

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the technology of
the ways of frequency

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
would be the one
allowing every being

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to go through one
dimension to another.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:10%
That is why sound was so
important, because if you make

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:10%
a perfect vibration
in one being,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.650 align:middle line:10%
in one side of the
universe, and it

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.430 align:middle line:10%
has the same amount
of matter and energy

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:10%
in the other part
of the universe,

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:10%
if they are resonating
exactly in the same vibration

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.080 align:middle line:10%
and frequency, so
whatever happens

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:10%
to this world or this
being is going to happen

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.480 align:middle line:10%
to this world or this being.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to realize
that they could build realities

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
through this time
and make models

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of these structures
of time here on Earth.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean civilization
was able to build the biggest

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
structures that even today
we don't know how to build,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:90%
which are the pyramids.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids all over
the world helped

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
us to build the
time machines to get

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:84%
into the communication with
every planet and every star.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:84%
The technology of
sound allowed us

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to go to the core of the
creation through time.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It was something that allowed
us to go deeper into the self,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:90%
into the creation.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the technology
that makes yourself

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.930 align:middle line:90%
a part of that technology.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
If the human using
that technology

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is not aligned with the same
vibration with the matter,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.470 align:middle line:90%
it is going to transform.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.470 align:middle line:84%
If you don't become the
stone you are going to carve,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
if you don't become the plant
you are going to make medicine

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
from, because the
energy of frequency,

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the
technology of frequency,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
the technology of sound requires
for a being in the matter

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.410 align:middle line:90%
to be aligned with every time.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is why for
Atlanteans, the first step was

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:90%
to make the path to the self.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is why they had to
teach every Atlantean how

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
to handle the emotions,
the body, and the spirit.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:84%
They had to make
this preparation

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
for the vibration
of the entire body

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and to be aligned in
neutrality so they could really

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
talk and resonate
with the other reality

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:90%
they were going to transform.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
That is the main key
of that technology.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not something outside
you as a technology

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that you have to become in
order to use and transform

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
the realities in
the third dimension.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:84%
When they were trying to open
those portals through the stars

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and the time, they had to figure
that the main structure of it

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:90%
was the body.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The key of everything
was the body.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So what they tried to do was to
imitate outside with minerals

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
the body of a human being,
and that was the key

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.035 align:middle line:90%
to open the portals.

00:21:09.035 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:10%
That key is called the ankh.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantean times, we
called it hai, which

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:10%
means life, the energy of life.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The ankh is a
pillar of minerals.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And when a priest or a
priestess would begin chanting,

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
it would start to resonate
in the perfect vibration

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
by resonating into two
spots, positive and negative.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Like a magnet, these two forces
would create a neutral point

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
of energy in the center that
expands up and down, creating

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:90%
the shape of a torus.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:10%
It was trying to imitate our
bodies and the way the Earth

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:10%
works with magnetism.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:10%
Our own body has
seven chakras within.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:10%
Then we have the positive
and the negative energy

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:10%
in our hands.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:10%
All the Kundalini energy opens
the lotus, the crown chakra.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.470 align:middle line:10%
And when it opens, it creates a
magnetic field around the body.

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:84%
In an ankh ceremony, there would
be four priests and priestesses

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:90%
and an initiate.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
One priest would hold
the ankh and two priests

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
would hold the djeds, which
were pillars of minerals

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:84%
with four different
levels of vibration

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:90%
that worked like tuning forks.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
The priestess would
begin singing, making

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:84%
the water vibrate in
the same frequency

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:90%
as the priest and priestess.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the priest would start
to sing, moving the djeds

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.641 align:middle line:84%
so they could hold the
vibration around the initiate.

00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.350 align:middle line:84%
The priest with the ankh
would take the vibration

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and transform it into
energy through the metals

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.837 align:middle line:84%
within the ankh and direct this
energy towards the initiate.

00:23:07.837 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
The pattern of energy that moves
between the ankh and the body

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
creates the main
channel of energy

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that would bend space and open
a magnetic portal of time.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Through this
ceremony, what they do

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.680 align:middle line:84%
is to tune the vibration
from that main channel

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:84%
with the vibration
of the initiate

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
so the body can reconnect
by resonance to the network

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:90%
of portals of the planet.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.770 align:middle line:84%
This would make the blood
of the initiate vibrate

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
in the same resonance
as the information,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
so the person would
become an extension

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:90%
of the portals of the planet.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They also in
Atlantean time, they

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:59.890 align:middle line:84%
used to put the dead bodies
in those high-level vibration

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:84%
so the atoms of the
body would spread and go

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
all over the universe,
again by vibration.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in ancient times,
they had healing places but not

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:90%
burial places.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't use cemeteries
to put their bodies.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.800 align:middle line:84%
They would just put their
bodies in the boxes that

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.970 align:middle line:84%
resonate so high that
they would just disappear,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and they would just
return to the source.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Through the teachings of the
Inna people, the Sirians,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:84%
they understood that all the
modification through time

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:90%
would be recorded in water.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And as we are almost
70% to 80% water,

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.920 align:middle line:84%
all our body would
be able to travel

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:84%
through time because of the
modification of our cells.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
What they did was to build
these structures of pyramids

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
like big centrals of energy
where they would put water

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
on it, and they
created mostly in Egypt

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
all these carvings
below with water

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.630 align:middle line:84%
so they would be able to
contact with different aspects

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:84%
The main city as I
remember in Khem--

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:90%
now it's Giza in Egypt--

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:90%
for us was called Ruhnilah.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And Ruhnilah was the
brain city, as we call it.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
All the structures,
temples, and houses

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.670 align:middle line:84%
were built connected one to
another through channels.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
All these structures needed
water to record information.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:84%
They would channel
specific information

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
from the human brain and
the brain of the Earth.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.830 align:middle line:84%
In the time I was
living there, I

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
don't remember
carving the stones.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.325 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
putting anything

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
in the stones,
because we don't want

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:84%
it to damage the information by
doing something inappropriate,

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
which is writing a concept
that we don't have,

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.985 align:middle line:90%
that is not a complete concept.

00:26:15.985 --> 00:26:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you put a
letter on a stone,

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.650 align:middle line:84%
you would codify the
information in just one aspect.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we did was just to sing
or drink water to the stones.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And the magnetic vibration by
these pillars, what we would do

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.870 align:middle line:84%
was to download or upload
information to the stones,

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:90%
to the pyramids.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And from the
pyramids, they would

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:84%
vibrate to the whole network
of information in every portal.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The most important
portal was in Egypt,

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and I remember there was only
one pyramid at that time.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Not three of them.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And this big pyramid was shiny
in the top with crystals.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It was connected with
two obelisks that also

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:90%
had these crystals in the top.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was create
a band of magnetic field

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:84%
in between the three
points that was

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
connecting through different
lines inside the pyramid.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And we had shiny
mirrors in every chamber

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:84%
so they would bring
the light in resonance.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:84%
This hall of mirrors
within the pyramid

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:84%
would allow us to see every
perspective of ourselves.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Inside water, inside
all this vibration,

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and by putting the consciousness
of a beam inside that pyramid,

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:50.320 align:middle line:84%
what we would achieve was to
go really high in vibration

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and speak with the world.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:10%
That's why we call the
Atlanteans the human gods,

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:10%
because we were
able to become gods

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:10%
during the process
of connectivity,

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:08.230 align:middle line:10%
during the process of high
vibration in these structures

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:10%
that Sirians helped us to
build and to understand

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:10%
how to travel through time.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed us to go
to the core of the universe,

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:90%
to the main answer, who am I?

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we
will discuss ancient Egypt

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:90%
during Atlantean times.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:10%

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.000 align:middle line:90%
