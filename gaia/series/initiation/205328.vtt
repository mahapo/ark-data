00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.360 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
the keys to build realities.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago when I
was born in the river Nile,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
we were taught
about our ancestors

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.950 align:middle line:84%
being the builders
of our realities.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
They were our
grandfathers, grandmothers,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and they used to be for us
like those blue ones coming

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
from the skies and bringing
information to Earth.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So we learned from them
about the realities,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
about heavens, about the
construction of Earth,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
and why we were here
in this reality.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:10%
For us, the most
important ancestor

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:10%
that we had for our
time is the mentor

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:10%
of our civilization
of Khem in Egypt

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:10%
was the one we call Djehuty.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:10%
Djehuty was the name that
represented the one who

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:10%
was balanced through time.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:10%
Djehuty was a person.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
He was born, first of
all in Middle East,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and he was sent to
Atlantis to organize

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:90%
the whole civilization.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
He was part of one
of the 12 families.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of was
one of the rulers

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:90%
of the system at that time.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:10%
Even though the system was not
ruled by kings or by men-gods,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:10%
the 12 families were like
this system of wise people

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:10%
to whom all humans
would ask what to do.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
represented the most important

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of all the other wise
people of the 12 families.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
That everyone in the families
would ask to him what to do

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and how to construct, build,
transform our realities.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The first priests
and priestesses

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:84%
used to teach everything
through stones, crystals,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and vibration, but when we
began to be disconnected to it,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
we needed to print
it, to write it.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we started
to use papyrus to write down

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:10%
all the information and to use
the hieroglyphics, hieratics,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:10%
letters, and sounds imprinted
on paper and then in rock.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:10%
These created the idea that
Djehuty was still alive

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.650 align:middle line:10%
in those who learned
how to write,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:10%
how to transcend information
through the words.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:10%
And because of the
papyrus was in the river,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:10%
and we harvest this papyrus
to write the knowledge,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:10%
we related that
the bird, the ibis,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:10%
the bird that was taking care
of the papyrus in the river

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:10%
was the symbol that connect
the wisdom of Djehuty.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all the
animalistic people, the ones

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that believed in
the nature gods,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
they start to relate
the knowledge of Djehuty

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:90%
with the ibis.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have this
god with the ibis head.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt time, we started
to call Djehuty like Thoth.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And then for Greek people,
they call it Hermes.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So the symbols of
Hermes was still alive,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and is still alive in medicine,
because he was the first one

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to help us understand that
the doors of realities

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
were in our bodies,
organs, blood, DNA.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the symbol
of Hermes was the snake.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times, the keeper
of the wisdom was the snake.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So the snake has the two tools,
the positive and the negative,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
that could kill us
or could kill us.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the magicians,
the physicians, they

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:84%
used to use this stick
to hold the snake

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and to take the venom so they
could make poisons to heal.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:10%
So that's why the symbol of the
snake around this caduceum that

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:10%
represented all the chakras
and the wisdom of every level

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness was the symbol
to create the poisons to heal

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:10%
the humanity, to
heal the bodies so we

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:10%
could open the portals of
wisdom within ourselves.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's why the caduceum
is still the symbol of Hermes

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:10%
and a symbol of medicine
in every culture.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty was the representative
of all the builders

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of realities on Earth.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
He was the human that descended
directly from the Blue Ones,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:90%
from the Arcturians.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the priests
that could live the most.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
That whoever was in
the temples, whoever

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:84%
was creating our civilization in
Atlantean times, in Khem time,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
everyone would
know him because he

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
was the one preparing everyone
through hundreds of years.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
That is why when we as a Khefian
people, the Atlantean people,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
we understood our
purpose on Earth.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
He was the one chosen to build
the network physically so we

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
could download all the
information from the highest

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:90%
spheres here on this planet.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty for our history,
he was like this mentor

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that designed our country, that
designed our way of thinking.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.810 align:middle line:10%
That he was the guide that
told us how to create what,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:10%
for all of us in that
moment, was our daily life.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
He was the guide of
the families coming

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
through the
Mediterranean Sea to live

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, to live in the Nile.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was kind of the one that
decided the role and the place

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that every one of us
would have along the Nile.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
His brothers and
sisters were living

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
all around the river Nile from
the very south to the north.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And they would keep
the idea that he

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
built about how to create
a proper society in order

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.280 align:middle line:84%
to contact the higher
levels of consciousness

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
in different spheres,
in different dimensions.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:10%
He kind of made this
plan that we in Khem

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:10%
call the Ater Tumti, the plan
of bringing heaven on Earth,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:10%
and how the Sirius people taught
to him and other architects

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:10%
how to create the
pyramids on this planet

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:10%
and how to move the
energy of time and space

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:10%
through the pyramids so we could
handle the portals of time.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:10%
When I used to live
there, the teachings

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:10%
of our whole way of thinking,
our culture, and our history

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:10%
was taught in one temple
that we called the Mahat Kai.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:10%
Mahat Kai was the place
where we understood the doors

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:10%
through time to
create the universe.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:10%
That's what it meant--

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:10%
Mahat Kai.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:10%
So in this temple,
the women and men

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:10%
that were in charge of
wisdom would teach us

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:10%
the first stages of how the
architect of the universe

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:10%
would create every reality.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty was the one that
settled the keys to understand

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
how the realities were
built. And his goal

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:84%
was to teach people how
to create those realities

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and how to open those
realities here in this planet.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
civilization was

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
split into different
levels of consciousness

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to the ones related to nature,
the ones related to society,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and the ones related
to the divine.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Those related to the divine
were the descendants of the Blue

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Ones, of the 12 families.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I was related to one of
those families at that time.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we had to
do was to learn

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:90%
about everything in the divine.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And that meant that we were
willing to rule the society,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and we were willing
to be the heads

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:90%
of the state of the society.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Djehuty
said the ones that

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
are going to rule the
society are the ones that

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
have to be more prepared to be
in relation with every sphere,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.060 align:middle line:84%
because ruling at the time of
Atlantis was not about power.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:10%
Djehuty and his
brothers and sisters

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:10%
tried to build a new
civilization that

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:10%
would go beyond the power.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the preparation
for the representative ones,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:84%
the 12 families, was to be
prepared in every emotion,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
in every part of
their bodies, how

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to rule their own power
within so they could

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:84%
be representatives of
the universe on Earth

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:90%
and not to be treated like gods.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:10%
One of the first things
that we had to understand

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:10%
was that we have not the
power because we were chosen.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
We have the power
because we are just

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
a part of the universe that
can understand the universe.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So whoever has this ability
has more responsibility

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
than any other,
because responsibility

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:90%
was the key for the universe.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The universe, the
creation of god,

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:84%
the creation of the
goddess, was to put there

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:84%
in nature everything
to be balanced,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:90%
everything to have harmony.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So whoever takes over
this harmony is not

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:90%
related to god or goddess.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why the 12
families has to learn

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
how to live in
balance and harmony

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:84%
with all the environment,
with every part of society,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
so we could be really
the eyes of god

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and the goddess on Earth.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And to understand
that, we were taught

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.740 align:middle line:84%
about the statements of
the universe, everything

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.240 align:middle line:90%
that had created us.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing we had to learn

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.120 align:middle line:84%
was the sounds in which we
could listen and understand

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
every part of god
and the goddess.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We would learn that every
aspect of the universe

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
has a positive and
a negative aspect,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that everything has a female and
a masculine aspect of reality.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's the only way
in which the universe

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
can create new realities,
through feminine and masculine

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:90%
aspects.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for us,
the sun and the moon

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:90%
was not feminine or masculine.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
The sun has an aspect
that was feminine

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and an aspect that
was masculine.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:10%
For us, of course,
was the two faces

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:10%
of what Egyptians
after that call Horus,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:10%
the masculine aspect
of god in the sun,

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:10%
and Sekhmet as the
feminine aspect of the sun.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:10%
Being also for the moon,
Seshat, the feminine aspect,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.930 align:middle line:10%
and Thoth, Djehuty, the
masculine aspect of the moon.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So for us moon and sun were
both father and mother within.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:84%
This double aspect
of every reality

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
helped us to understand
that we need to find

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:90%
the balance in order to create.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
That there was no
feminine over masculine.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
There was no masculine
over feminine.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
That both of them had
to be balanced in order

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to create new realities.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
This helped us to
understand that we

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
have to respect every
aspect of the universe

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
new realities.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
That we cannot be in control
of any part of the realities.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:90%
We have to become both of them.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:10%
So the teachings was to
become beings so neutral

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:10%
that we could hold
within the feminine

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:10%
and the masculine
aspect in just one self.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:10%
That's why in ancient
times we had not a word

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:10%
to describe she or he.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:10%
We call all of them nu,
which were the ones that

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.200 align:middle line:10%
came from the sky to the earth.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.010 align:middle line:10%
There was a pronunciation
of feminine and masculine

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:10%
altogether-- nu.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We had to understand that the
creation of the whole universe

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
was through one self
that was understanding

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
who he was, that was giving the
truth to others, that was both

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:84%
of them in concept in one
self, that could create

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
new realities divided in many,
that those many could go over

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:84%
every timeline and every
space creating new realities,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and that those beings had
to deliver to the universe

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.650 align:middle line:90%
the balance through the heart.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And those aspects of the self
was called Ammanenumotyni.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Ammanenumotyni was the name
of this god in expression.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:40.440 align:middle line:84%
"Ammanenumotyni" means I, you,
he, she, us, you all, and they.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
These aspects was called
like one being split in many.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why we needed to
understand the language

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
to understand how or from
which aspect of the universe

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
For us, the first
things to be learned

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
were the exact words in order
to learn how to talk about god.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty was very
clear about this.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the universe
was created through an idea,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:90%
but the idea was vibration.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
This idea, this mind
of the universe,

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:84%
would be only expressed outside
itself through a vibration.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
This vibration
would reach a rhythm

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
in which these realities would
be meeting and transforming

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:90%
once and again.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
exists in the universe

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
will be created or transformed
by the aspect of polarity.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
This polarity would help us
generate all the realities

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why,
through generation, we

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
find the purpose of duality.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And this duality helps us
recognize that everything

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is connected in the universe,
that everything has a rhythm

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to follow, that everything
comes from the vibration

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.100 align:middle line:84%
of this expression from
within and outside,

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and that this outside can only
exist through the idea of the

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:10%
So this process was known as the
Mhs Shm for us in the universe.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:10%
For us in Khem, the M,
the portal through time,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:10%
H, to the space, S, Mhs,
and the coming back, Shm.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:10%
And this expression was
divided in seven laws

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.390 align:middle line:10%
that every one of us had
to learn how it worked.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:10%
These seven laws,
for us, were held

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:10%
in the spiritual mind connected
through the learning process.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So all of us were
the only one spirit

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the
learning process

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
through seven laws
in the middle.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:10%
That created the idea that
we are all just one being

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:10%
trying to learn about itself.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And the way it does
it is through creating

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
an idea, the first law, the
mind, the idea of everything

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
and then projecting this
idea from within to outside,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
which is the correspondence,
the second law.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And then generating
this vibration in order

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
to create this bond between
the inside and outside, which

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:90%
is vibration, the third law.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the fourth
law which is rhythm.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
This will have a rhythm that we
call the wheel of time or karma

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:84%
dharma that goes
through time and space

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
like the beat of a heart.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.620 align:middle line:10%
Actually through
that law, Djehuty

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:10%
would say that if you
are able to listen

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:10%
every heartbeat of every
living being in the universe,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.590 align:middle line:10%
you would listen the music
that holds everything

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:10%
working through time and space.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.850 align:middle line:10%
And if you balance
your heartbeat

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:10%
through every
heartbeat-- like if it

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:10%
is a clock in the universe--
you could reach and find

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:10%
the perfect amount of vibration
to reach the very first beat,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:10%
the very first heartbeat.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:10%
So you could find the
key to go through time.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why we needed
to meditate in order

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to balance our fourth law of the
universe, which was the rhythm.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
After that, we would realize
that everything bidden

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
in the universe
would create a wave.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And this wave would
move everything around.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:90%
So every cause has an effect.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:90%
And every effect has a cause.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the fifth
law of the universe.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we had the sixth
one, which was polarity.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:84%
In order to create
those realities,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
we need a point A and a
point B to go and to move

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:90%
forward and backward.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:10%
So that movement would create
the positive and the negative

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:10%
that creates the seventh
law, which is generation,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:10%
the creation of new realities.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
These seven laws
that he established

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
were the seven laws that we
had within in our own chakras.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:10%
These seven laws
were established

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:28.280 align:middle line:10%
through the consciousness
of these other two ways

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:10%
of seeing the universe--
the eagle or the falcon that

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:10%
had all the
information from above

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.720 align:middle line:10%
and the snake that had
all the wisdom below.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:10%
So these two aspects
of reality were

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:48.960 align:middle line:10%
taught to all cultures in
the universe in our planet.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So every culture, every species
of humans in this planet

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:57.830 align:middle line:84%
would know that we are the
middle point of seven laws

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
in between the knowledge
of the falcon and the hawk

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:90%
and the wisdom of the snake.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why every culture
has these two aspects

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
of the positive and the negative
and the seven laws in between

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to understand how
the universe works.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:84%
In Mahat Kai, we learned
about these seven laws

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
through vibration.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:10%
He said it that in
order to understand

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:10%
how everything works, we
need to know the first words

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.150 align:middle line:10%
to understand it.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have the
people, the beings,

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
which was the Ammanenumotyni,
the concept of god,

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:90%
through all of us.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And we had the
dimensions of god,

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:90%
which was the vibration I am.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:84%
This vibration, which had the
nine aspects of the universe

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:90%
with the three breathing--

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
ham, het, hum-- were the
representations for him

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:90%
of every aspect of god on Earth.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The 12 faces of the planet,
the 12 constellations, the 12

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
chakras we have within,
and the 12 aspects of god

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that we now may know with
the name of archangels.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:29.480 align:middle line:84%
He said that every one of us
was a tiny cell of an archangel,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:90%
which is an expression of God.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So the 12 archangels
that we know today

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
with different names, like
the most known Uriel, Michael,

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel, they are the
different aspects or attributes

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:90%
of God, which is El.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
For all ancient
cultures, God meant El,

00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:84%
because for us, the word "El"
means the truth that is spoken.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So the verb, the truth in blood,
the truth in geometry was El.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the
related shapes of God

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:90%
was called something and El.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
These aspects were the
ones that we had to learn

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and that we call in different
ways in every culture.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
But in our culture,
in the Khem culture,

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
we divided it in the
12 aspects that we

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:84%
had to learn from every
one of the schools

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
that Djehuty taught,
created for us to learn.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:10%
To each one of those
schools, he attached

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:10%
a positive and a negative
way of expression of God.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.270 align:middle line:10%
So we had a priest and
a priestess, a feminine

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:10%
and a masculine,
working together

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:10%
in each one of those
temples in order

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:10%
to help us understand the
two concepts of reality.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:10%
We have these 12
temples, these 12 faces

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:10%
of the reality divided into 24.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:10%
These 24 were the
keys or the letters

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:10%
to understand that
every reality was dual,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:10%
that we needed both forces
to understand how it worked.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:10%
So every one of
them has two gods--

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.940 align:middle line:10%
one god and one goddess--

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:10%
or one priest and one priestess
that represented the duality

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:10%
and then one creation
which is the Trinity.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And the creation will
represent the goal

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that every student
would have to achieve in

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
between those two points.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
temples of light,

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:84%
we would have the Trinity
of Osiris and Isis

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:90%
with their child, who was Horus.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And this trinity, one
helped us to understand

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.620 align:middle line:84%
was that Osiris was
the seed of life,

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that Isis was the flower of
life, and then in the middle,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
we have the son, who was
the creation, the eye that

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:84%
could see everything created
through the seed and the fruit

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:90%
or the flower of life.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And our goal in that temple was
to learn how to become the seed

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and how make that seed
to fertilize the flower

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and to create the fruit,
which would be the son.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So our goal was to be like Horus
on Earth, to be enlighted ones.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Also for the darkness, we had
Seth, the lord of darkness.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:10%
And we had Nephthys,
the ruler of the wisdom

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:10%
from the underground.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.460 align:middle line:10%
And both of them
created death, which

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:10%
was the transition in
between life and death, which

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:10%
was Annubis, Anubis.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:10%
He was the keeper of the souls.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.840 align:middle line:10%
Anubis was the one
that we all had

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:10%
to look for, because
since we were born,

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.180 align:middle line:10%
we were prepared to die.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So one of the teachings
that we had to do

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
was to become our
own rulers of death.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you ruled
your own death, you

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.550 align:middle line:84%
become Anubis, the
concept of dying.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And through death, you
can enlighted yourself

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:90%
in the darkness.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.240 align:middle line:10%
So those aspects of
trinity were trying

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:10%
to be reached in these 12
temples in which we worked

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:10%
through love, wisdom, will,
earth, fire, water, air, here

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:10%
and now.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:10%
And the aspects of the sun,
the moon, and the underground.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:10%
Each temple has these
duality of gods.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:10%
And in each temple, we would
learn a concept of the divine.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:84%
The first divine aspects
were the HHH, ham, het,

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%
hum, the ones related to the
sun, the moon, and the earth.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.490 align:middle line:84%
These three concepts were the
breathing aspects of wisdom--

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of the sun,
the knowledge of the moon,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and the living proof,
the experience on Earth.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:84%
These three teachings would talk
about heh, ha, and het, which

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
were the concepts
of the eternity.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:84%
The concepts of
eternity was to learn

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:90%
how the reality was eternal.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:84%
That the physical bodies, they
don't end and they're finished,

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:84%
they just transform
into other shapes.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
That the energy also
transforms in other shapes.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness goes
through all the shapes

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and transcend the material
or the physical structures.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn that
everything was eternal,

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that everything was an idea
that flows through eternity.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing
that we had to do

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
was to live our lives
like if it was a dream.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
We were taught about how
to see in darkness, how

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to survive through dream, how to
create realities through night.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, for a
long period of our time,

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
we spend our lives in
night, through night,

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:84%
and in darkness
places, so we could

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.720 align:middle line:84%
recognize that all that is
created is just a dream.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And if we become dreamers,
we can construct that reality

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
This created a
state of mind that

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.330 align:middle line:84%
makes us believe that
we could do anything,

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that realities were just a
dream and that we can decide

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:18.700 align:middle line:90%
what to do in those dreams.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.990 align:middle line:84%
All this process of knowledge
that Djehuty taught us to us

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:84%
was to understand that
every reality in every part

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
was bounded to us

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and that we were the only ones
that could build the temple

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:84%
to let them all in, and
that we had the keys to open

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:90%
those doors of those temples.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:10%
So for us, Djehuty was not only
the father of our civilization,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:10%
he was also the father
of our knowledge,

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:10%
of our wisdom, that
priest that helped

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:10%
us to understand how
everything worked

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:10%
and that made us
free from other gods,

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:09.220 align:middle line:10%
and help us to be our
own gods and goddesses.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will discuss

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.490 align:middle line:84%
how the universe created
religions to find itself.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
