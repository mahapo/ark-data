00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> How did such an
advanced civilization fail?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.010 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.220 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
how internal conflicts caused

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis to be destroyed and how
its colonies created a new path

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:10%
for human civilization.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.000 align:middle line:84%
All I know about Atlantis'
fall was told by my grandfather

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and by our priest and priestess
that taught us about history.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like for us now in America
and the republics of America,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn about the
history of the colonies

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and go to school to learn about
the Spanish or British Empire.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
This history for
me was like trying

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand the history of my
grand grandfathers and mothers.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we all have
to learn about this history,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
because it was the
story that made

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
our countries, that made our
colonies where we lived then.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
What we were taught about
Atlantis, Khefislion,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.070 align:middle line:10%
was that this
civilization was meant

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:10%
to create gods and goddesses
that we as humans had

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:10%
the potential of the
whole universe within,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:10%
and that we had to
take that power outside

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.050 align:middle line:10%
and to understand how to build
our world in order to imitate,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:10%
to resonate with other
worlds, what we call

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:10%
our ancestors from the stars.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:10%
So these civilizations, for
us, was the mentor, the idea,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:10%
the first code from
which we understood

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:10%
what is the purpose of
society, of civilization.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:10%
The people from
the stars taught us

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:10%
that when we create
a civilization,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:10%
the history, the
languages of our countries

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:10%
are the different ways in which
we can speak with the world.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So other planets can talk
with the soul of this planet

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:90%
through our civilizations.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we want a
civilization that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is able to speak by the
world, that civilization

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:84%
has to become the only one
civilization in the world.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
this planet is that we

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
are a constant creation.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So it is impossible
for this planet

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
to create only one
idea of the self.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible for us to
create an only one world order.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when an empire
gets to the most expanded

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:84%
time and the most powerful
expression of itself,

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that's the moment we
know the fall is coming.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Khefislion, Atlantis was meant
to be the one connecting us

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
all, creating this
order in the world.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And this goal was
perfect for them,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
because we started
the time of Virgo.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Virgo was the constellation
that was in the skies

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
when Atlantis was
rising in the world.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So that helped us to understand
that this time would be the one

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to seed a new
civilization and the one

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.090 align:middle line:90%
to order a new civilization.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the main physical
threats that Atlantis had

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.790 align:middle line:90%
was the ones coming from up.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Outside the planet,
the Confederation

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
has many species
that were looking

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:90%
to humans in different ways--

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
those who saw
humans like the ones

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
that were going to be able to
reach the evolution that they

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
couldn't, the unifying
concept of every race,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
and other ones that understood
that humans were just tools

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:90%
to evolve.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were using us like
animals for experiments.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:10%
So those are the
one we call Xiamur,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and we now name
them the gray ones.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:10%
These were the ones
that were following us

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:10%
with different ships that
were like controlling us

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:10%
from their ships,
and they also tried

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:10%
to take the power
of the Protiktah

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:10%
These Xiamur were one
of the species that

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:10%
were looking for the
power of this technology.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So this was one of
the main threats

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that our civilization
had and from who

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
we needed to protect the most.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:10%
The rise of Atlantis time was
in between the end of 16,000 BC

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:10%
and the beginning of 15,000 BC.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
This period was the
one when Atlantis

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
started to realize about its
power and its purpose on Earth.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:10%
And then during the
period of 15,000 to 13,000

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:10%
BC was a period where
the empire of Atlantis

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:10%
ruled the whole planet.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:10%
During this period, they
built all the structures

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:10%
to fit the network
of the physical world

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:10%
with the ethereal one,
so they could download

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:10%
all the information that we
named the consciousness of God

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:10%
or the memory of the planet.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We were able to connect and
download the information

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:84%
from every mineral,
plant, star, so we would

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
be able to understand the
whole process of evolution

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and what do we have
to do with that.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis had to go around
all the planet and seed

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
their seeds in cells, in blood,
in DNA to all humans around.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why for
the Arcturian people

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
was so important that the
blue ones, the Atlantean,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the original Atlanteans,
the 12 families,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
needed to be crossed in
blood with all the humans.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And that made the
Atlantean people

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
the only ones able to
survive on this planet,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
because they became
human for the first time.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:84%
That was the most important
key for these civilizations

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to arise around
the whole planet.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But this civilization
has this goal

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:84%
to create a thought
that could unite

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
the whole world in the same
spectrum, in the same idea,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:90%
in the same code.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So if the 12 families could
rule the 12 faces of the planet,

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
so everyone could think
the same and everyone

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
could be representatives
of the Mother Earth.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So what this was like
is opening the portals

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
of magnetical
structures in the world

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
through pyramids,
through temples,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
so the structures could
open wide the connection

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
with the magnetical
energy of the planet,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
so everyone could
download the information.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
During Atlantean
times, the 12 families

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:84%
were able to open every
portal in the planet,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
so that helps every human
to be aware and to connect.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So every human was able to
be connected to the network

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
by itself.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And that created the
mind of the world.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean civilization
was so powerful

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because every human
in its civilization

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
was able to achieve the
connection with the network.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's like if instead of
having cell phones today,

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
we become our own
cell phones, where

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
we could download and
keep all the information

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:90%
from the whole network.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
So because of that,
this civilization

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:90%
was the most powerful.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:10%
But something that
we were taught

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:10%
from the people of
the Confederation

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:10%
was that this was
just a process,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:10%
so the world could
understand who she was.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we needed to
seek for other ways in which we

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:90%
could be transformed.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:10%
And they settle a time for that.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:10%
They said, you have
to see the skies

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:10%
and you will understand
that you will

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:10%
have only 2,500 years to do so.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
After that, you need to
transform your civilization

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.000 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Because everyone knew that.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Everyone had this
awareness, because everyone

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
could see the sky and
how it was transforming

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
every time, every day.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of understood
that we have not

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:84%
much time until we had to
transform our civilization.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:10%
Our grandfathers
and grandmothers

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:10%
told us that that is why
from the main colonies,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:10%
from the main islands, the
priests and princesses,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:51.370 align:middle line:10%
like Djehuty, Isis, Osiris,
they came to our lands

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:10%
and settled the idea of the
creation of a new civilization

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:10%
based on the self,
on the construction

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.050 align:middle line:10%
of the being instead of
the ruling of the world.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Because of this, the 12 families
settled in different parts

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:10%
of the world.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:10%
And they established
their own power.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:10%
And this meant that a lot
of people from Atlantis

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:10%
were not thinking the same way.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:10%
So each one of those families,
instead of thinking like one,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:10%
they started to think like
different civilizations.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
They started to
think by themselves.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And this brought a problem
for the Atlantean people,

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
because they started to see
how their paths were separated.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So the main idea of losing
control of this civilization

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
from the Virgo era was
something that got them crazy.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:10%
This main mother civilization
were trying to rule the time.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:10%
And you cannot rule the time,
because it's something outside

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:10%
of your own power.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:10%
You can go through time,
but you cannot handle it.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:10%
And when they
wanted to handle it,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:10%
when they wanted
to get the power,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.540 align:middle line:10%
they did the biggest mistake
they could possibly do.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:10%
They were the civilization
that prepared humans

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:10%
to become gods and goddesses.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:10%
And they start to believe
that a god or a goddess

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:10%
was able to control reality.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:10%
And that was their main mistake.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:10%
They put the "I" over the "am."

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And the "am" was more
important than the "I."

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:10%
So "I am" was split in two
parts in our civilization,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:10%
in Atlantean civilization.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And that created the idea that
the main mother civilization

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
had no idea about
what to do anymore.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Because our time as a
civilization was ending,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to control
time so they could handle

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
the power through all the
eras and not just the one

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:90%
that they were supposed to be.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And that was the problem.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
They forgot what they had to
do, what was their process,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and they became an empire
instead of a government.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, the
people of Atlantis

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:84%
started to move from the
main islands to the colonies.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And they went away
because the colonies were

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:90%
asking for their independence.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So this independence that
every colony was asking for

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
made that all the economics
that the Atlantean Empire had

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.590 align:middle line:84%
was finished, because
the colonies wouldn't

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:middle line:84%
send any more food or
materials for the main islands.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.870 align:middle line:84%
This ended the communications
through the oceans

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and made a lot of
people, the population

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
from the main islands,
to move to the colonies

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.810 align:middle line:84%
so they could have food, they
could have the materials,

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
they could have
houses, they could

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.280 align:middle line:84%
keep going with
the economics that

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:90%
made the countries being alive.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So because of this, also
the priests and priestesses

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
moved from Atlantis, so the
main teachings of Atlantis

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:90%
was finishing.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So that brought the younger
ones to the main colonies,

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
so they could keep going
with the studies of the self.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And that brought to Atlantis a
problem in the main structure

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
of their civilization,
that people were leaving

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and the power was leaving,
and they had no resources

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:90%
to survive by themselves.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:10%
So because of their losing this
process, this time, this power,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:10%
they decided to go and
conquer the other colonies.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And this process was
called like a civil war

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
in which the main island
tried to control all the rest

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:90%
of the 11 faces of the planet.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
colonies fought back,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and they had this war
in different regions

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
with Atlantean population.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to use, again,
the energy of the Protiktah,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the sun like
they did in Lemuria time,

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.770 align:middle line:84%
so they could control the
power of the colonies.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle line:10%
But this was different.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:84%
During the end of Lemuria, it
was the time for the Virgo era

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:90%
to start.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So for Atlantean times, it was
the beginning of its new era.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So time and space
were letting them

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to go through all the planet,
because the time and space

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.960 align:middle line:84%
needed Atlantis so we
could harvest this energy

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:10%
But when Sirius people said
this is not your time anymore,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:10%
you need to change,
everything need to change,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:10%
now is the time for every
culture of humanity to rise,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:10%
because this is Leo era.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the time in which each
one discovers its own power.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantean people began
the war against the Leo era.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And that created these
militia strategies

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
to control the whole world,
and that made the colonies

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:90%
be against the main island.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So this war was brought
to Europe, to Middle East,

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to America, and they kind
of were killing themselves.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.200 align:middle line:84%
When they used
the energy that we

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.870 align:middle line:84%
had to make the connection
around the world

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to rule every
colony, what they did

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
was to empower the main
pyramids of the Atlantic Ocean

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to reach the energy
of every pyramid

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and take control over
the consciousness

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:90%
of every civilization.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:10%
If you rule the pattern of the
pyramids of every civilization

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.470 align:middle line:10%
in every face of
the planet, they

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:10%
would be like controlling the
mind of the whole population.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was like sending
some pulses of thoughts

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
in which all the population
would just think whatever

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
they wanted them to think.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:40.250 align:middle line:84%
This made them become
like totally the opposite

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:90%
to what they were created for.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
They were created to bring
awareness and consciousness

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:90%
in this planet.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And because they were
losing their time,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
they were just becoming
totally the opposite,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.550 align:middle line:84%
creating unaware, creating
unconscience in the planet,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:84%
so they could still
rule the planet.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
So this cut the connection
between the pyramids.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.130 align:middle line:84%
This destroyed the connection
between the whole network

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and stopped the
process of each human

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:84%
to be connected to
the network by itself.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
So the pyramids
started to shut down.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
The whole system
started to shut down.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And all this wide open
pattern of connection straight

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
from myself through the
network was shutting down,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:90%
shutting down.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And that made the
disconnection of the memory

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, every neuron
that represented every human,

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:90%
was like dying.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Like if we were into
a process of amnesia,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:10%
into this illness of
forgetting everything,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:10%
like the biggest Alzheimer
you could possibly imagine.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:90%
So the main system was shut up.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happened, they were

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
able to use the energy to
fight against the rebels that

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:90%
were in the colonies.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And when they did that, they
used this amount of energy

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:90%
against them.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But because it was disconnected
and the whole network

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.290 align:middle line:84%
was this distortion of unaware
of unconscience, all the energy

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that they used to
go to the colonies,

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
it just went back to the
main core with such a speed

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:84%
that all the vibration just
destroyed the main island.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
use this tool for war.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
disconnection of the network,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
all the pulses that they
were sending outside,

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
they just went back in one time.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.440 align:middle line:84%
That created the
biggest destruction

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:90%
of the main civilization.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And this was the ending of
Atlantis as we recognize it.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:10%
But the worst thing was coming,
because of this separation

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, because of
all the shutdown of the system

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:10%
and the death of
the main pyramid,

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:10%
no other pyramid was able
to control the weather,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.000 align:middle line:10%
to control the
magnetism of the planet.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So North Pole and South
Pole started to move faster.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
They just went away from the
main spots where they were,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
and the whole network switched.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
When that happened, all
the pyramids and temples

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
were just left in
places with no energy.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So all the network of vibration
started to move like waves,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:90%
so nobody could reach it again.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:10%
What this created was a
process of thousand years

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:10%
in which the disconnection
was every year faster

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:10%
and every year more deeper.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And when this
disconnection ended,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:84%
what happened was the
destroyer of the North Pole.

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
When the North Pole
destroyed itself

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
because of all this
magnetical pulses that

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
were switching in the planet,
all the water from the North

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Pole started to
melt. And it melts

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
so fast that there
were not walls

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that could possibly retain
all this amount of water.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
These walls were
made of ice, and they

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
were closing this area
between Scotland, Iceland,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and Greenland.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And the main dam that was
holding that water in the North

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Pole was in La Mancha
Canal that now we

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:84%
know as the sea between
England and France.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
This region just broke, and all
the water from the North Pole

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:84%
started to melt and to
go to the Atlantic Ocean.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:84%
When the whole system
shut down, the water

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:90%
went back to the oceans.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment
when the colonies stopped

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
being connected
through the ocean,

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and they just went
to the rivers.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the ocean told
us, this is the end

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:90%
of the connection of the world.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We remember this
like the big process

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of the flood, the big flood
in the biblical stories

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
in every culture
around the world,

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico, in China, in
Japan, in Middle East,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, Europe, we all
remember in different stories

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
how the big water came to the
planet and covered everything.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
This process was in a
short period of time,

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:90%
less than 50 years.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And everything changed so fast
that the civilizations that

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
were settled in the Atlantic
and the Mediterranean seas,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
they just had to
leave these regions

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and ask for the colonies
to receive them,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:90%
so they could survive.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
The main colonies to accept
in these people where

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the colonies in the
Mediterranean Sea,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East,
and in Central America.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
The people from Atlantis just
went and mixed with the people

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:90%
from the colonies.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was the ending
of this civilization.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:84%
We all have to learn about
what happened in that time

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:84%
because our history,
our new history

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
was about not doing
the same mistakes.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And during the Leo era,
where we have to learn,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:84%
it was the power of the
self, to rule ourselves

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and to understand
that we had to rebuild

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the civilization in
some time, but we

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:90%
had to do it in a proper way.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
We knew that because of the
line times would change us all,

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:84%
we needed to make these stories
to survive through languages.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we stopped
connecting the network above,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and we began to tell
stories with our mouths,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
with stories that we could sing,
that we could tell to our kids.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.680 align:middle line:84%
This story went through
many priests and princesses

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and people that were writing
about the history of Atlantis

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and what happened to
our civilizations,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:84%
so we could understand that they
made all the mistakes that we

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
could possibly do, that our
civilizations were created

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to become gods and goddesses,
but we stopped being gods

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses to create
the idea of being a god

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and a goddess, which is totally
different from our process.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We start to think that
we were over the nature

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
when we had to become nature.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
That was the main goal
of our civilization,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to become the planet,
not to be over it.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And this was the imprint code
that Atlantean civilization

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:84%
has left for the next
12,000 years of history.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:10%
But the Sirius people, they
told us time you cannot change.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Time is like a mirror.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So everything that happens in
this half of the time, 12,000

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
years for each one of the faces,
is exactly the information

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that we need to receive to
understand what is next.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So we would find that
the Virgo era is exactly

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the opposite to the Pisces era,
and that Leo era is exactly

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.280 align:middle line:84%
the opposite to the
era of Aquarius.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So we now are living in
specifically the timeline

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:19.130 align:middle line:84%
in which the Atlantean times
ended and a new era has begun.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:10%
This process tells us that
the last 3,000, 2,000 years

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:10%
were the mirror of Atlantis.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:10%
But because Atlantis was
an organized civilization

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:10%
in the era of Virgo, that's
why in the era of Pisces,

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.860 align:middle line:10%
with this era of just ideas
and not physical structure,

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:10%
we had a very
chaotic era of 2,000,

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:10%
3,000 years that was the
mirror of the Atlantean times.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So all the power,
the empire trying

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
to conquer the whole world,
this was the structure

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that we created in this
2,000 years before us.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is why also
it's our civilization now

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:84%
in this past 100 years
that created the network

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to connect the world
again, each human

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to be connected again to the
whole network of information.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.890 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the mirror
of what Atlantis did.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.320 align:middle line:84%
But also because
of that, we have

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to learn that we are
specifically in the same spot

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:90%
when Atlantis ended.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us to
create a new civilization

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Aquarius era, we need to
see what happened in Leo era.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And Leo era was the time of
the colonies, the time where

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty and all its
brothers and sisters

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.110 align:middle line:84%
created the countries that built
the idea of building the self.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:10%
So we are not trying to
imitate the Atlantean times.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
We now have to see what
happened after Atlantis.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:10%
That's what it is
important for us--

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:10%
which civilizations were the
ones trying to build the self.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:10%
Because the new era
that has become--

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:10%
that is starting now
is the era in which

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:10%
every self will recover its
power by itself, without anyone

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.780 align:middle line:10%
to say what to do.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly
the mirror, and that

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:84%
is why myself had
to remember what

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
happened to me in
those colonies,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:90%
when we were ruling the world.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
same story that we

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:43.090 align:middle line:84%
are going to live in
the next 2,000 years.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:84%
With a deeper connection
to the planet Earth,

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.030 align:middle line:84%
we can now look to
the skies, consciously

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.510 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the major portals
that surround the planet.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
With this understanding and
rediscovering our purpose

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:84%
here on the blue pearl, we can
connect to the Mannick network

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.400 align:middle line:84%
with an open heart and allow the
fifth and the sixth dimensions

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:84%
to connect deeper within
us and our planet.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Next season, we will explore
this zodiac portal system

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
surrounding us, dive farther
into how the Orion War impulses

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Earth's evolution, and discover
the ways in which the six

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:84%
dimensional architects shape
the patterns of creation.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
