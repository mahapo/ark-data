00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,
MatÃ­as de Stefano.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I
am going to explain

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:10%
what the pillars of reality
are and how this allows

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.380 align:middle line:10%
certain possibilities in time.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I will explain how this pillar
supports the circle we all

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:90%
live in today.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension is straight
creation from the second one.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:84%
At the moment the positive
and the negative were created,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
everything that was within the
self in the first dimension

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
was split into the outside world
in the positive energy, which

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
will create after that
the third dimension.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that we
have this third dimension,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
we will also see that the second
one splits also and divides

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
in four.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension is the one
that holds the third dimension.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.010 align:middle line:84%
This four steps or
four pillars of reality

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that holds the third
dimension within--

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
they are the statements in
which time and space are related

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and in which we all living
beings in different dimensions

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:84%
are expressed and we
must follow in order

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish our
step-by-step learning.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
These four pillars are also
called the process, the process

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, how
the universe works,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and how we can go
through the universe

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to understand that everything
has steps, that everything has

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
a process, and that the only
important thing in the universe

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:90%
is not to achieve a goal.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It is to go through the process.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
has four states.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
The first one is expression.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
experimentation.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:10%
The third one is integration.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:10%
The fourth one is transcendence.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are the four
pillars of every process.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And we can see it in the
third dimension all the time.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
We have in the universe
the expression,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
the inner negative reality
within every being,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
which is, I know what
do I have inside.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So I have to express
itself outside.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So expression is when the
self express itself and expand

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
itself to the outside world,
to the outside reality.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the first stage,
the first process--

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
expression.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
After that, we have the
stage of experimentation.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Experimentation is when you
live, touch, feel, see, hear

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
everything that
you have expressed.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to live until the very
end of every experimentation

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
of every process, everything
that you have created.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So there is no way to
escape from experimentation

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
because the only way to
escape from experimentation

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is in this third stage, which
will be the integration.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Integration is to put
all the things together,

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
purpose of everything.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite of expression.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
The expression goes outside.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Then you experiment everything.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And integration is
to put all together.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I used to explain
this like if you

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
were a kid with a
lot of imagination.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:10%
And you just imagine a
wave of possibilities.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
this possibility

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of create your own
games and toys.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:90%
So you work on it.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And you create all these
castles and characters and all

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:84%
these games around
and all these toys.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And you just go and play in
this big room with all of them.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
experimentation process starts.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And this is like a mess.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have to figure out
how to put them all together.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And the process
of integration is

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:90%
how to put them all together.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:84%
How do I organize this room to
understand every game I did?

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:84%
What do I learn from all these
games, from all this play?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
integration is when

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
the mother says to the kid,
you have to organize your room.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
the stage we are

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
all in now in the third
dimension in the planet

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Earth in this time.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
We have played with reality
since, I guess, 10,000 years.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So we were playing with
reality, with things,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.570 align:middle line:90%
no idea what to do.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
But we were just doing stuff.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to
organize all this

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and to put them all together to
understand why we have to live

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:90%
all this 10,000 years of mess.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the mother, Earth,
is calling us and saying,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.550 align:middle line:90%
you have to organize your room.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we are now--
is the process of integration.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:10%
Once you achieve integration
and you see everything

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:10%
that you have done, everything
that you have expressed,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:10%
created, and you have played
with all that, you have

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:10%
experienced every
one of your toys,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:10%
and you see the purpose
in all of it and say,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:10%
this is all my creation,
comes the fourth stage,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:10%
which is the transcendence.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And transcendence
is, this is not mine.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't create this.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't belong to me.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I made me free from that.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And I made that free from me.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So I go to another
stage of reality--

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
to transcend everything that
I have created, to let it go.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So transcendence is to
understand the whole process

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
and go for another
level of consciousness

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:90%
to express a new reality.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
The four pillars
of realities are

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
the four ways in which the
circle of life has to be done.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:10%
In the third dimension,
this four we call born,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:10%
grow, reproduce, and die.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Die is the process
of transcendence.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you have born,
which is expression.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:84%
You are born, and you
express your life.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
breathe, to see,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
to express all your
organs to the outer world

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:90%
from the inner world.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to grow.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.060 align:middle line:84%
That is the process
of learning to see

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
what hurts you, what makes you
happy, to feel every emotion,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
to feel every
relationship, to understand

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
your role in the world,
to work, to study, to do

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:90%
a lot of things.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the process
of reproduction

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is a process in
which you put all

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
what you have learned together
and give it up to another one,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to another being.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So you give your
experience to other being.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And you see the product
of all your learnings

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.650 align:middle line:84%
in your life, which is
the product of all this

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:90%
learning-- a son, a daughter.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is the integration
of the process--

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:84%
when you realize the
purpose of your life

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
not only biologically,
but also in a project.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
When you have a project, when
you have something to do,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.920 align:middle line:84%
a goal in your life, when you
achieve that and you see it,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
then it is the process
of integration.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
When you realize
why you have started

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
this degree, why I went to this
school, why have this family,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:90%
why--

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
when you answer every
why in your life

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
is when you have integration.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:84%
You realize the
purpose of everything.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:90%
And when you do that, you die.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the process
of transcendence.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Die is a gift of the universe
to the souls and spirits

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to be free of our creation.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Die is not something
bad for the universe.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
This is freedom from
what you have created.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you die because
of time and you

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
don't die because
of consciousness,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:84%
you are engaged in this
role of circle of life

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.770 align:middle line:84%
in which you have to born again
and to grow again, reproduce,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:90%
and die again.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's the samsara, the wheel
of life in which you cannot go

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
out until you die
with consciousness.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And die with consciousness
is not to die in body.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
It's to transcend and
go beyond the body

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
so you live in the
memory of everyone.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So transcendence is to be alive
but split in all the people

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:90%
that know you.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So transcendence is the
process in which you live away

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:90%
everything that you have lived.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And you are free from
everything you have created

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and the goals you have achieved.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:84%
When you have lived in the third
dimension every possible way

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and every possible experience
you could ever have,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
you will transform
every karma and dharma.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So you will become
a teacher, a master.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But masters and
teacher doesn't teach.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:90%
They show with experience.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.010 align:middle line:90%
They are coherent.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
to explain anything.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:90%
They just have to be.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And when they are, they are
just giving this information

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:90%
to others.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So as we have this
enlightenment,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
the planet also has
this enlightenment.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:84%
The planet has these
four stages, too, which

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:90%
is the most ancient symbol.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
That means the
expression that we

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:84%
call "spring," experimentation
we call "summer," integration

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
we call "autumn," and
transcendence we call "winter."

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:90%
We have four stages.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So the planet enlights
itself every spring

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
once and again in the
movement of itself

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:90%
circling around the sun.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So the planet is also living
that process like humans

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.360 align:middle line:90%
does in their own life.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And we also have seen this
in Native American symbols

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and ancient symbols in
Asia, too, and Africa--

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
this circle with
the cross within.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:10%
That means the sun
and the four stages

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:10%
of the sun, which is also
the way you can see time.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Every culture in the
history of humanity

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:84%
has this knowledge that the only
way you can attach and unite

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
the four stages
through time and space

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
are the equinox
and the solstice.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:10%
That's why for many cultures
all around the world,

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:10%
the ceremonies were held in
those dates, the specific dates

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.780 align:middle line:10%
of the planet-- because
they were exactly

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.590 align:middle line:10%
this cross in which time
and space were connected.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why for many
cultures around the world,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:84%
they knew that if they
connected to those four days,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
they are all aligned with the
consciousness of the planet

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and the whole process of time
and space in their selves.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So when you put all
the times together

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to live in just one spot,
which is your own center,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
you can see this
symbol of enlightenment

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that has the whole process of
the fourth dimension in just

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.370 align:middle line:90%
one life.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why every
enlightened being is also

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
put in front of a sphere, of a
circle, of a sun, or a cross.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why for Christianity,
too, the cross is so important.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not because Jesus
has died in the cross.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
It's because he
represented the sun

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:90%
and every time and every space.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:84%
That enlightened
is not someone that

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
has accomplished the whole
process in the universe.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Enlightened is the ones that
had accomplished their process

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension,
not the whole universe.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.530 align:middle line:84%
There is an ancient
thought that just say,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to give away
the fruit of your will.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:90%
You seed the plant.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:90%
You water the plant.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:90%
You saw the plant grow.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:90%
You saw the flowers.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:90%
You saw the fruit.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And then this fruit
doesn't belong to you.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
While you have accomplished
seeding just one tree,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
the next expression will
be to seed a forest.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So a big consciousness,
more responsibility.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Transcendence of every
process of these four

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.186 align:middle line:84%
states in time and
space is to go up

00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:90%
and up and up in evolution.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:35.790 align:middle line:84%
We call it "up" because we
have heaven up and Earth below.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness is
like a high vibration.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we are in
the low vibration,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:84%
living like a being
that is trying

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to survive in this planet,
it's low vibration,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:90%
low consciousness.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:84%
This is like most
of the people we do,

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
like try to survive every
month by working and paying all

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:90%
these bills and other things.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:84%
We have created a
process in our life

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:84%
in which we are trying
to survive the process.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
So this is the low vibration.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Then in the very
high vibration, you

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
realize that you
don't really have

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to survive because there is
only one truth in the life.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:90%
You are going to die.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you are going
to die, you don't have

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:90%
to make an effort to survive.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:90%
You just have to live.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you realize that
the process of transcendence

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.520 align:middle line:84%
is a process to a new
creation of yourself,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:90%
then you are free from survive.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And you are now able
to leave the spiral

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
and to go up in evolution.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that, you start
to realize that you are out

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
of the third
dimension, which tries

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that you survive in the third
dimension as a living being.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And you go forward into
the fourth dimension.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension is where
the time and space is relative,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
where you realize that
everything that you have lived

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:84%
is also being lived in
every dimension possible.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have many
universes in which

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
you are trying to understand
and to leave this reality

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:90%
in many perspectives.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth dimension is
something that kind of bends

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the time and space
so you can go and see

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the possibilities of
every decision you

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
have made in your life, every
step you give your life.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You can see every
result possible of what

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
you will do and also the main
spot from where you have come.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So in the fourth dimension,
you as a human being

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:84%
or as any being that was
in the third dimension,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
you can see at the same time
past, present, and future

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.800 align:middle line:10%
Fourth dimension is
the one that allows

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:10%
you to see the story of your
soul, not just your body.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:84%
So in the fourth dimension,
you can see all those beings

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that are free from
the third dimension

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
and which they are the ones
that can see your past,

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
see your future, and
creates your reality.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to
the fourth dimension

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
because you are free from
the concept of survival

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
because you know that you
are never going to die,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
you are going to just
to transform yourself,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
you are in the fourth dimension,
in which you see yourself

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:90%
going through time and space.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:10%
So you see every one of
those circles of life

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:10%
that you call the
four statements

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:10%
or four pillars of reality,
which is the process.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:10%
The four pillars of
reality is the goal,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:10%
the only goal that
the universe have,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:10%
which is to live
every possibility

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:10%
in every time and every space.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why for the ancient
people and many people in other

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:20.640 align:middle line:84%
planets, we don't see time
as a prison in which you are

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:84%
in a cage, and you
cannot go out from that.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We see time and space like
a way to move, like a car,

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:90%
like an airplane.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:84%
We see it like technology
or a way to go from one spot

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the
third dimension,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.440 align:middle line:90%
you are conditioned by space.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.380 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the
fourth dimension,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
your are conditioned
by time, not space.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So the way you move in the third
dimension is through space.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
If you have to go
from year to year,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to move yourself,
your body, to get here.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:10%
But when you are in the fourth
dimension, you just do this.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And you are already
there because you

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
can travel through time.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:10%
That's why in the fourth
dimension, nobody used bodies.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Everyone used time.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone used time
as a way to travel.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
This process of the
fourth dimension,

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of things lives
in, is also the reality

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:90%
where lives our subconscious.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
At the moment that the third
dimension has been created,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
split in three--

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, unconscious,
and subconscious.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:84%
We have also three statements
in the third dimension.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So in the fourth
dimension, you are

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.090 align:middle line:84%
able to go through
your subconscious.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the whole
patterns that have created you

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:90%
in this third dimension.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's an easier way
and an easier place

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
where you could see your whole
story and to try to understand

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:84%
your whole story, the
one that creates you

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and the one that you
are going to create.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
The universe creates this
split of the second dimension.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And by polarity, it creates
the fourth dimension.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:10%
So we have the four statements
of the universe, which

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:10%
will be the process of time in
which the third dimension will

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:10%
live.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:10%
This process has to move once
and again, once and again,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.110 align:middle line:10%
like a wheel, once and again.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can see different
realities all the time.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
When you have
expressed a reality,

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
then you have
experienced a reality.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
integrated a reality.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you transcend
that reality.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The transcendence is to
move a little bit forward.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you have another
one, another one, another one,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:90%
and another one.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And you move again, and another
perspective, and move again.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we call--

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:84%
when you live from
one perspective,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe in your next
life you will be

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
born like a different being
in the same situation.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So you can see a different
way of the same reality.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why maybe if you are
the good one in this life,

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
trying to solve a
problem, in the next life

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
you have to be the
opposite so you

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
can see the other
opportunity of that reality.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So that makes the being
to see every choice

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and every opportunity from this
circle that is going to create.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So you have this cross.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you have
lived every possibility

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
of that only reality,
you create the circle.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:10%
And after that, the circle must
also change the perspective.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So as many times you leave
the circle and as many times

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:84%
you change your
perspective, suddenly what

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:90%
you will have is a sphere.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the most
wise beings in the universe

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:90%
look like a sphere.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
The beings like planets
and the beings like suns

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
are the most wise
beings in the universe

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
because they have
lived every expression

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension, every
possibility of every time

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they are
beings that are allowed

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:90%
to create life by itself.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:90%
That's why Earth creates us.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:90%
We are not living on Earth.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:90%
We are Earth.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Earth has created us as
the way in which she can

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.860 align:middle line:90%
think and do and act by itself.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:84%
So we are the expression of
this planet, being created

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
by this planet all the time to
express because she has already

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:90%
lived all these perspectives.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So that creates this
sphere of time and space.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why the fourth
dimension helps

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:90%
to create the third dimension.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And there you have a clue
of how the dimensions works.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:84%
You won't go from
the first dimension

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:84%
to the ninth dimension
in that order.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:10%
The first dimension just do all
of this like a breath process.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not step one,
stage two, stage three.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the way we in
the third dimension--

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
because we are separate,
we can't understand it.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
The only way in
the third dimension

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand a
process of the universe

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:90%
is by empiric test.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:84%
You need to study
to make the process

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to understand every stage
of the process to understand

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:90%
if that's the truth.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need science
in the third dimension

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.880 align:middle line:90%
to understand things.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the first and the
most important tool

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that we have to understand
things in the third dimension.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
In the fourth dimension,
we have the spiritual way

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand it, like
in the fifth dimension.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.880 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual way is
another dimension.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not the third dimension.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so difficult
to understand realities

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:27.270 align:middle line:84%
from spiritual beings
in the third dimension.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
is not something

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that comes after
the third dimension.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It's something that just appears
because the third dimension has

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.320 align:middle line:84%
appeared and because the
second dimension has split.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So at the same moment
that duality exists,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
the fourth dimension
exists because it's just

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:90%
a consequence of that.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
third dimension

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:90%
are the product of space.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth dimension
is the product of time.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:84%
There are some people that
say that we are heading

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to the fourth dimension
and some people that

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.630 align:middle line:84%
are saying that we are heading
to the fifth dimension.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But really, we are not
heading to any place

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.532 align:middle line:84%
because that's a thinking
from the third dimension.

00:25:19.532 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in
the fourth dimension,

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
you're not moving anywhere.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.833 align:middle line:84%
You are just changing
your perspective.

00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as de Stefano,

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.830 align:middle line:84%
for this series on the
creation of the universe.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
we will dive into the
statements of the universe.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.824 align:middle line:90%
