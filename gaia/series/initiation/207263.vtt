>> How do the portals in our
galaxy create the star systems

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:26.595 align:middle line:90%
of the zodiac?

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
In this episode,
we will describe

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:10%
the creation and
design of the star

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:10%
systems and their patterns.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we relate the
zodiac system like something

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:84%
to understand our
personalities, to understand how

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:90%
we work in life, how we live.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:90%
But it's not only that.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:10%
The 12 constellations that
create the zodiac system

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:10%
that we know is a
system, a programming,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:10%
that creates the
realities that we

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:10%
are living, and not only
the personality, but also

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:10%
the structures of mind and
the structures that goes

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:10%
through different levels of
vibration and dimensions.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So they are the
portals, the doors,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
that imprint the information
from the spiritual mind

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.515 align:middle line:90%
to the physical world.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything that exists
in the third dimension,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in the physical
realities, is held

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:84%
by these patterns of energy,
these pulses from the stars

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and the suns that are
all around the galaxies.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way we can
understand how the matrix works

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and holds every reality.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:84%
We've been explaining
how the time

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and space is just one thing in
different states of vibration.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The time is this network
that is like a spider web,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
crossing all the
vibration of the universe

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and aligning every
pattern of vibration.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And the streams of
these lines of time

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.120 align:middle line:84%
are pushed towards
the center to a core

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to create a very tight structure
of time that we call gravity.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
This pulse of gravity creates
what we call the matter.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
The matter starts to
concentrate all the energy

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:90%
in just one spot.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And through that spot, you
can go through all the times

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and all the spaces.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
This is what we call a
portal in the first stage.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
This portal would
be the place where

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
every timeline in every space
can be related in just one

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.240 align:middle line:84%
spot of the reality,
so you can go

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.030 align:middle line:84%
through every vibration in just
one moment or just one spot.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
A portal holds so much
gravity and so much

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
energy from every
timeline and every space

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
that creates this amount of
energy going and flowing to it.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
That is what we call
a star, black hole,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:90%
the core of a galaxy.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
This core, in which every
dimension and every vibration

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is connected, creates
this path through

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.828 align:middle line:84%
the high-level vibrations of the
dimensions, like seven, eight,

00:03:35.828 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
nine, six, into the ones
that are more physical,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
like the patterns of
the fifth, the fourth,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:90%
and the third dimension.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So these structures
creates these lines

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that are connecting every
timeline and every space

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
through the mind
of the universe,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and that allows the
universe to breathe from in

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and outside all the
information of the mind.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The main structure
that was created

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
through this squeeze of energy
and this stretch of energy

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
through time and space were
in the sixth dimension.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension
created the first patterns

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
in which we could
see and understand

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
the shape in how these
portals were created.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
These portals would have
now the shape of geometry.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And these shapes of
geometry would teach us

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
that every spot was a
portal to go through

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
and to see every reality
from one spot to another one,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and bending the atoms,
creating these fractals,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
so you can see every shape,
every form of the universe.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to
the portals, you

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
will reach the information
of the whole universe.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But in order to see and to be
aligned with that information,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.810 align:middle line:84%
you need to go through
the lines, which

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:84%
is the process of
enlightening or rise up

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
in your level of
vibration so you could

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:90%
match with the information.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you have to go
from the point A to point B,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and you need to get in the
same level of vibration

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to the point B in order to
receive the information,

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
because you are low vibration,
and you need a high vibration

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
to understand this
information that

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:90%
goes through time and space.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So that means that,
in order to get there,

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
you need to work
on your vibration

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to be rise up so you can reach
and match this new information.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is the patterns
that were created

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension that
we call the initiatic path

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:90%
of the being, of the realities.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.940 align:middle line:84%
These structures, these beings,
were transforming every reality

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
so we could
understand how to move

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
through the different
processes of the portals

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and to see, feel, and
experience every information

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So, in order to reach
that spot, in order

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to reach that new
information, you

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
needed to go through the
shapes of the trinity.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
You need to go from
point A to B and then C,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.880 align:middle line:84%
because the point
C in the matter

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
would be the third
dimension that

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
allows you to see the
whole process you have

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to take to understand
everything,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:84%
to understand why you, at the
first stage, decided to create,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to express, and to
experience this reality.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So you need the trinity to
understand why you created,

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
what is the purpose
of your creation,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and then experiencing it
so you can understand it

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:90%
from the self.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
All this process
of trinity is how

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we can see all the spectrum
of the icosahedron.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is formed by
all these structures of trinity

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and all bounded by the core.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
They create these
patterns inside that

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
are the main
tetrahedrons that creates

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of
positive, negative,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and the neutral
reality in the core.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
This structure would help
us to understand the path

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that we have to take
in order to follow

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the process of evolution.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And once you have this structure
in the sixth dimension,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.790 align:middle line:84%
to download it into the fourth
and the third dimension,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
you need a huge
amount of energy.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is why every
one of those patterns

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
start to duplicate, multiply
itself for thousands

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:90%
and many thousands.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And these high
vibrations that we

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:84%
need to reach the
information of every spot,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and they start to
split in so many

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
that there is so much energy
around and spinning, that it

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
creates the atomic energy,
and then the creation of what

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.905 align:middle line:84%
we call the stars, the solar
systems, and all the matter

00:08:10.905 --> 00:08:11.705 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:84%
This reality that was created
through this sixth dimension,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:84%
what it did was to
put in a physical way

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
these portals around
every reality.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So if every galaxy has a
spot in the middle from where

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
everything came from,
and all the projection

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
of the icosahedron; dodecahedron
start to split like a torus

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
around to hold this matter
that is being created,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
the portals of those structures
in the sixth dimension

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.605 align:middle line:84%
will be physical in the galaxies
with the shape of stars.

00:08:50.605 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:84%
The stars are the
spots through where

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
the energy of every
portal go through.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But in order to understand
the purpose of those stars,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:84%
you need to reach the patterns
that hold them together.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.540 align:middle line:84%
You need to see not
only the stars, but also

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
the space in
between them, so you

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
could see the shape
of that structure that

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:90%
holds the whole portal.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
A portal is not just one
star or just one spot.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's the conjunction of many
of those spots that were split.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you want to find
the main core of a tree,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:84%
you have to see every
branch, and then you

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
will understand
that they all are

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:90%
connected to just one trunk.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
This structure will
help us to understand

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that every flower is a sun
and every leaf is a world.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you see all these
branches, what you will realize

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is that they all form a pattern
that connects to the Earth

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
through just one
branch or one trunk.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the whole
shape of a star system,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:84%
connecting all these
spots, you will

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
have the lines of
evolution, and you

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:84%
will have the lines
of the sixth dimension

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
in order to connect
them all to just one

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:84%
spot, which is the core and the
vacuum towards the everything.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
This structure in
the sixth dimension

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
imprinted in the third
dimension is what

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.250 align:middle line:90%
we call the constellations.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
We have thousands and
millions of constellations.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Constellations are not just
a few stars that face Earth.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We just know 12 of them,
because from our planet,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
we reach these 12 phases
in our perspectives.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But from other planets,
we have other structures,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:90%
other constellations.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
The pattern of 12
phases is what helps

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
us to understand that
everything that has a sphere

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
shape, like the
planets, the suns,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
has 12 spots through
where the information can

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.820 align:middle line:90%
be breathed into the matter.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So every sphere in the universe
has to see into 12 perspectives

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.070 align:middle line:84%
so it could download
the information

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:90%
from every one of the portals.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
For each constellation in
each galaxy, each planet,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
the 12 phases would
be very different.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So for Gludok, we had
also 12 constellations,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:84%
but they were nothing like what
we have here in our planet.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the constellations
has an encoded pattern

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that shows the way in which
every species understand

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
these structures that
holds and creates reality.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective of
Earth, these dimensions

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that we can see all around
in the constellations

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:90%
are the 12 phases of time.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
These 12 phases of time helps
us to understand that every time

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that the planet is
going around the sun,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:84%
we will understand that
each one of those portals

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:90%
will imprint their stamp.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
They will give us
their energy to create

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
a civilization, a
reality, a life,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
according to the energy that
flows through those stars.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:84%
That created the idea
of the zodiac system.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
The zodiac system
is a way in which

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
we could relate the stars to
understand which energy was

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:90%
flowing through its portals.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:10%
We call it zodiac because
we put animals on it,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient word in
Greek for animals is "zoo".

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So we call those
structures like animals

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
because we related the aspects,
the information, the emotions,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:84%
the data that we could download,
the attributes of these phases

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
of our sky, with
attributes that animals

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and beings in our
planet has, so it

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
was easier for us to understand
how this information was

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:90%
downloaded here on Earth.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
When, in the ancient
times, we understood

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
came from those stars,

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:84%
from those
constellations, we also

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
understood that the
characteristics that they had

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
were also the characteristics
that shapes our civilization.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So from each time
period on Earth,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
the past civilizations
understood

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that the information of those
species and those stories

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and those informations that
came from those portals

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:84%
were shaping the ideas
of who we are on Earth.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So that is how we understood how
the geometry of the structure

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
were shaping time

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:90%
and space in our realities.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Every being that is
in the third dimension

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:84%
is ruled by these phases that
creates every other pattern

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
We are the conjunction of
every timeline and space.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:84%
We are this mass
of energy that is

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
being held by all the
gravitational energies and all

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
the timelines and all
the vibrations that

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
are around the universe and
that flows through the portals.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So every reality
that we have now here

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is a fractalization of
those 12 first portals.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So that is why, whatever
happens or however

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:84%
we feel through these
portals in the sky,

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.450 align:middle line:84%
we are the modeling
of those informations.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We are the product
of these pulses

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:90%
of energy from those stars.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So as we on Earth
are really touched

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:84%
by the energy of the
sun, the moon when

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
it's night, when it's
day, and all our lives

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:90%
are built because of that.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:90%
We work by day.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:90%
We seek for food by day.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:90%
We grow our food by day.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:90%
We do our connections by day.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And by night, we go to sleep.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So we did this
kind of connection

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that night is the moment where
you can feel the spirits,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
where you can feel
other dimensions,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
while during the day,
you can feel the Earth.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:90%
You can enjoy the reality.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand how
the moon moves the water

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:90%
and moves our emotions.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that that also
happened with the streams that

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.910 align:middle line:84%
connects us through the
gravity of all the stars

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
through the galaxy.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So even if it's a tiny
energy that touches us

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
from the very far
boundaries of the galaxy,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
this energy has been
flowing through the universe

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:90%
from very--

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:90%
way before we were here.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So our structures were built by
the gravity of all the galaxy.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:90%
We are not just from Earth.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We are the product
of all these portals

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
that were pushing and
pulsing these energies

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:90%
through the realities.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is why,
for every being that

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is in different dimensions,
it's so important

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:58.460 align:middle line:84%
to understand the patterns
of this zodiac system.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's important
to understand ours.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
We have many ways
to understand it.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Chinese has some ways
to understand it.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian people had a
different way, European people.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.660 align:middle line:84%
In Mexico, they have another
way of the 12 phases of the sky.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has many phases
and many constellations.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But 12 of them were
the most important

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
that shaped our ideas.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
This was not something
that we created here

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:90%
as an idea in humanity.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:84%
This was something
settled by the structure

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:90%
of the sixth dimension.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So the four first
beings that were

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:84%
created from the sixth
dimension were the species

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:90%
of earth, fire, air, and water.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And these four
species shaped itself

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
in different vibrations, in
different symphonies, so they

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:84%
could create the
patterns, the path,

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the evolving
process of spirits

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:90%
in the matter.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:84%
These species
created the pattern

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:84%
of Earth, in which
we first on Earth

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.590 align:middle line:84%
had to understand the
importance of matter.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
After we understand the
importance of matter,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
we need to understand the
order of all this reality.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
After we understand
the order, we

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:90%
need to create our own reality.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So we prove and
we see the matter.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
We put order in the matter.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And through that order, we
start to create our own reality.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
This was the trinity
of the process

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth species
has to work with.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So every being that was in the
third-dimensional realities

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:90%
had to follow that pattern.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the water pattern.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The water pattern shows
us that every energy that

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
was split in the
dimensions was just

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
the fertilization and the
distortion of the main reality

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:90%
of the main mind.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go
deep in the darkness

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to follow and to seek that part.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
The pattern of the water
brings us from the darkness

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:25.750 align:middle line:84%
to the love, to the
meaning of the emotion.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to
understand that everything

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that was created
is the mind that

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:84%
is connected in this big ocean
that we call the universe.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So everything that exists
is the same body connecting

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:90%
through the waves of time.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
water beings understood

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:90%
the process of trinity--

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
go into the darkness,
seek everything

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that was divided in the
depth, then find the process

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.100 align:middle line:90%
of giving it a meaning.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we see
the whole pattern

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that connects everything, the
dark part, the light part,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
everything in just
one, to understand

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:90%
that we are all just one being.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the beings of fire had
to go through the trinity that

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
represented the
strength, represented

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:84%
the will, those who had to
fight to enlight the energy.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:84%
The first stage of the fire is
just to mess everything around

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and to create chaos
in the universe,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.570 align:middle line:84%
so then you can understand
how you can rule that chaos.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
This chaos that you have
created in this second stage

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:84%
of the fire process
is when the being

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
starts to recognize itself
like the empowered one.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:90%
It's the heart chakra.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And from them, we have to spread
the order, the mind, the ego,

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:90%
to other beings.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
The process would be
to understand that we

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:90%
are playing with reality.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to rule
ourselves in this play

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:90%
that we have created.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:10%
And then we have to
share our learnings

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:10%
of who we are with every being
that we have created before.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a process of fire to
share the energy of creation.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the process of air.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:84%
The trinity of the
beings of air would

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
be to create every belief,
every religion, every pattern

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.260 align:middle line:84%
of our own ideas, to see
different perspectives

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves and to be
related to all those aspects.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to put
them all together,

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:84%
to put balance in
all these thoughts.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So we need to clarify our
mind and to find the justice

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:84%
in between all of them, to
find the order in the mind

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:90%
that we have within.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And once you have the
order in the mind,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:84%
you reach the third
process of air, which is

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:90%
creating through your own mind.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You are not this
creation by others' mind,

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
but your mind is creating
everything around.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So these processes that
we have are the 12 path

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that you have to take
in every dimension.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not just for humans.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
This is for every being
in every dimension.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to go through
all these processes

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:84%
before they get to the core,
to the ninth dimension.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
The trinity pattern that we
have to follow from Earth

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
imprints the attributes
of the stars in ourselves.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is through magnetism
that, by resonance,

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.770 align:middle line:84%
the stars, the vibration of the
stars, the pulses of the stars,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:84%
are molding the
shapes of our bodies.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is like
how vibration works

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:84%
when you change the
vibration in one spot,

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and this being that is related
to this other vibration

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
starts to rise its
own vibration to be

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:90%
aligned with the first one.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So if every constellation
was the main portal

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring that information
to our worlds,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:84%
so everything that was
created through those portals

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
would attach the same
amount of vibration.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And by relation, they
will mold this reality

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that is a fractal from
its own vibration.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:10%
So that is how the
constellations shape us,

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:10%
and they, just by resonance,
awaken the potential

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:10%
that we have from them within.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.980 align:middle line:10%
We are stardust.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:90%
We were born through the stars.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment when the
constellations billions

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
of years ago were
settled, and they

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
start to create these
trees that connects

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
all the patterns
around, they would rise

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:90%
and would fill all the space.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So the potential that they
were spreading in our realities

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.930 align:middle line:84%
created the life in
different worlds.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
We are one of those.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So our stardust, the
creation of our matter,

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
is just a physical reaction
of how the stars were created.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And that is why whenever,
whatever happens

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to us in our world, when it's
changing, when it's turning,

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:84%
when it's spinning, they
can activate in ourselves

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the same vibration
that they have.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is how a portal
activates by vibration

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
from the higher-level
dimensions to the physical ones.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.760 align:middle line:84%
We are all bounded
by these 12 phases

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:84%
in every part of every
galaxy and every planet.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is
projected from the portals

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
creates everything
that we understand here

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:90%
in these realities.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So that is why it's
important to understand

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that the zodiac is not
something that just

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.240 align:middle line:90%
talks about our personalities.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
is molding realities.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the trees of
life, the trees

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that opens the information
through the mind,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the
projection of these 12 phases.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So understanding
them and learning

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
about the attributes
of each one of them

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
would help us to
learn about ourselves,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:84%
about our own
creation, and the tools

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have to reach the
information in every dimension.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
The zodiac is the process
towards evolution.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a way in which
the ancient people tried

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to explain, by animals, by
emotions, by stories, what

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.670 align:middle line:84%
was the information that
each one of those portals

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:84%
has to give us so
we could evolve

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and we could become aware of
who we are and use it, use

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that energy and
that information,

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:90%
to create our own realities.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:90%


00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
the use of trinity
in the portals

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and how it unites
body, soul, and mind.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.267 align:middle line:90%
