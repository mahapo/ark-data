00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The story and mythology
of Atlantis has been deeply

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:84%
planted in our
subconscious mind.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Because in a way,
it was the beginning

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:90%
of our current civilization.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
People want to know
how it started and why.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:84%
When I was born in the
colony of Atlantis,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I remember everything we could
possibly know about Atlantis,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
about our mother civilization
through the stories

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.620 align:middle line:90%
of my grandfather in that life.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean
people were the sons

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
of the first mixed between
those people coming

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
from the stars and
those people from Earth.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:10%
The Aesir, who most
know as the Annunaki,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:10%
were giants that settled
in the Middle East.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:10%
They had sons and
daughters with the humans

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:10%
to make a civilization,
to help the Annunaki

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.810 align:middle line:10%
transcend on this planet,
because their planet was dying.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
That created us, the same,
the people from Atlantis.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Annunaki treated
humans like sons and daughters,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
but there were some
that treated humans

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
like slaves to harvest minerals
for their own dying planet.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:84%
The Greek god Poseidon,
whom I knew as Thalon,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
was an Annunaki father
who protected and guided

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
12 of the same children from
their isolated civilization

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East and moved
them through the Mediterranean

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
to the Atlantic Ocean, far away
from the dominating Annunaki

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
to protect them.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.075 align:middle line:84%
This created the 12
families of Atlantis.

00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:10%
The planet has 12 doors
that open information

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.340 align:middle line:10%
from every constellation.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:10%
So that's why they
choose 12 kids--

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:10%
girls and boys-- to put all
this information in their water,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:10%
in their blood.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.320 align:middle line:84%
The first stage of
this culture was

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to divide the main island
in 12 small regions that

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:84%
were controlled by
these 12 families.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:84%
They understood
that they were not

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
the rulers of the civilization.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They were not the ones having
to control the population.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones keeping the
information from the stars.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.290 align:middle line:90%
They were not able to rule.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:90%
They were able to guide.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean people recognized
that the inner power

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:84%
was to look farther and not
only the horizons of the planet,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.565 align:middle line:90%
but also the horizons of stars.

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of Atlantis
and the origin of humanity

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
is a complicated
but important story.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
When we listen about the
Annunaki and the Aesir,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.070 align:middle line:84%
what we have in mind
is that they came here

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to create the human experiment,
and that they were our fathers

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and mothers, and that they were
the first ones on creating us.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is not
even them knew that they

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.376 align:middle line:90%
were part of the experiment.

00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
This season, we will dive
deeper into the experiment

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
by exploring the creation
of races in the universe,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
discover how our
ancestors from the stars

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
influenced the
creation of Atlantis,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
and uncover how the Atlantean
empire provided a blueprint

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:90%
for human awakening.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.792 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.705 align:middle line:84%
Who was responsible for
the creation of races?

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
how the introduction of races

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.858 align:middle line:10%
created powerful, evolutionary
steps for humanity.

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
When the whole
universe was projected

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
in different
dimensions and started

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
to create a different
perspective of itself,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
the most important
they mentioned--

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that we had to create
more perspectives

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:90%
to see who we really are--

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:90%
was the sixth dimension.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension
would be six spheres

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that represents the pattern
of life in the universe.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why the flower
of life is six.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And the water, when it froze,
it gets the shape of the six,

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:84%
so is the main structure of
creation of every living being

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:10%
And then by polarity to have
a being living in between time

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:10%
and space, the six
patterns of time

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:10%
has to split into
six parts of space.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So then you have the 12
faces or the 12 beings--

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
Elohim.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
That creates every being
in the whole universe.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why the sixth dimension
is the dimension of architects.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
These architects were divided
in different trinities

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and different beings that
we call the seeds of life

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:90%
or the seeds of the universe.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:10%
And these big creations,
these big theorists

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:10%
are the first beings that
are helming the creation

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.270 align:middle line:10%
and the project of bringing
life to the third dimension,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.398 align:middle line:10%
to the fourth dimension,
and the fifth dimension.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
These beings are
called the Elohim.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Normally, people used to call
them like that if they were

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:90%
human-shaped beings or angels.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But the first ones
really were big bodies

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
in the universe with
a spheric shape that

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
start to divide itself
like different cells,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
like an egg in the
womb of a mother.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So it started to split
in different thousands

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of cells.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So each one of us
comes from one Elohim.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim were divided
in different frequencies,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:90%
different vibrations.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So each one of them also
were called different rays

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So these different
rays of light,

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.870 align:middle line:84%
these different rays
of colors that we're

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
feeling-- that the universe
started to create what

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
we call the idea of archangels.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Archangels is the way
that we used to call

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
the Elohim in other vibrations.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So to understand who
they are, to understand

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
these first beings,
we need to understand

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that they are the biggest body
in the universe that you could

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
possibly imagine, and that you
are a cell inside of this body.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:90%
We all know of these ideas.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Greece,
the idea of Kronos.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Kronos was the god of time.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And he had all of his
kids through dividing

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:90%
the parts of its body.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So all his sons and
daughters came from every one

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.620 align:middle line:90%
of the parts of him.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we
can understand how

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:84%
the ancients understood
the reality being

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:90%
born through time.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the main idea of how
the Elohim were creating

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
through their own body the
different races, species,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and different realities
of the third dimension.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:10%
This Elohim were the
will of the universe

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:10%
to know itself, to look for
tools for different ways

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:36.890 align:middle line:10%
to understand itself.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.190 align:middle line:10%
So they understood that
the creation of life

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.850 align:middle line:10%
would be a way in which,
through evolution, they

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:10%
could experience different
processes, different aspects

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:10%
of themselves.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So they start to take the
shapes of the geometry instead

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:90%
of the vibration.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.300 align:middle line:10%
They stopped being
waves through time.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And they began to
have the shapes

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:10%
of the living beings
in the reality of space

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
The first species
being created by them--

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
they were not what
we think about.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It is a species.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:90%
We are the final product of it.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:84%
We are the result of evolution
through billions and billions

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
of years of processing in
the matter in the creation

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:90%
of the third dimension.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:10%
The first species
that were created

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:10%
were the beings that control
the four more important bodies

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:10%
And the universe has five
bodies, but four of them

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:10%
are the most important.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:90%
First of them is water.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
Earth or minerals.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:90%
The other one is fire.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.310 align:middle line:90%
And the last one is air, gas.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So these four elements
were the first beings

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:90%
created in the universe.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.160 align:middle line:84%
In some planets,
we would find life

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.250 align:middle line:84%
created through gas,
life based on fire,

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
life based on minerals,
and life made of water.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
We are from the
minerals and water.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
There were thousands of
first species created

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.220 align:middle line:90%
through those four of them.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But for us, bacteria
is the most important.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And from experiences
of water, they

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:46.440 align:middle line:84%
created the structures of
all the rest of the species.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
The fifth body is the one
that connects everything.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And we call it
the ethereal body.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's the mind and
the memory of everything

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that is bounded to the soul,
which is the energy that

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
goes through every one
of those four species

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and all the ones that
comes after them.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:10%
From the ethereal
world, the first species

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:10%
that were created, and
had a shape to be a life,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and to hold
consciousness by itself,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:10%
divided from the
consciousness of the universe,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:10%
were the ones on the
fire and the gas.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:10%
They were more ethereal,
so they were more

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:10%
aligned to what we could
recognize as individuals.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So they were living
beings from the suns

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and living beings
from gas planets

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
like Jupiter and Saturn.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And those beings are
totally different from us.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's impossible to talk to
them, unless we are elementals.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
But these first structures,
these first living species

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.340 align:middle line:84%
were created at the
same time that suns

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.000 align:middle line:84%
were created, at the same time
that galaxies were created.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:10%
Then when the minerals and
water beings start to evolve,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.580 align:middle line:10%
what they did was to bring these
ethereal shapes into water,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:10%
creating the first living
beings like Pleiadians

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:10%
and other beings that
are so enlightened

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:10%
itself in other
dimensions, that they

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:10%
could hold the spirit of fire
and also live in the water.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
That is related to the creation
of water in the universe.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:10%
But the most related to us--

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.770 align:middle line:10%
the water beings
more related to us

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:10%
like Pleiadians, Lyrans, and
other beings in the galaxy--

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:10%
they started to begin when
the water came to this planet

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.443 align:middle line:10%
around 4.6 billion
years ago when

00:12:53.443 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:10%
the moon crashed with Earth.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
There were other planets and
a lot of comets and asteroids

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:90%
going all around.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And the gravity of the
moon was bringing with it

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
big rocks of hydrogen, that
with the collapse of Earth

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and creating the big crater
of the Pacific Ocean,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
it brought all the competence
to create the water here

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So that would help
this planet to be alive

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and to have the water as other
planets couldn't hold it,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
because of the
difference-- temperatures

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:84%
or the different
range to the sun.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
This process was not held
by the confederation.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
This process was held
by the sixth dimension.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:10%
The way they tried to
create new realities

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.840 align:middle line:10%
is through the destruction
of the ancient one.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:10%
So all the chaos
of the universe was

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.290 align:middle line:10%
the key to bringing the
seed of life in this planet.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
When the patterns of the
sixth dimension were created,

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:84%
they had to be put into space,
which is the third dimension.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
But the only way you can
attach to the third dimension

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is through time, which
is the fourth dimension.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:10%
So all the beings alive
for the first time

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.510 align:middle line:10%
with the consciousness
of the self

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.110 align:middle line:10%
had to go through
the fourth dimension.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:84%
They were building
the first living

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
beings, the first species
into the fourth dimension.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So they could find the process,
they could live the process.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:10%
In the fourth dimension,
they had these four stages

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:10%
in the universe, which was
expression, experimentation,

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:10%
integration, and transcendence.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:10%
The main problem that they
had creating these species

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:10%
in the fourth dimension was
that to just live one process,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:10%
they could probably need
thousands and billions

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:10%
of years.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's so difficult
for me and for everyone

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:84%
to explain when it
specifically happened,

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:middle line:84%
that civilizations
and species that

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.700 align:middle line:84%
were first created into
the fourth dimension

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%
went to the third one.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:90%
So these main civilizations--

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
they had this problem in
which they were eternal,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
so they lived forever
in the same shape.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:10%
So that had the problem that
we lived thousands and billions

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.840 align:middle line:10%
of years with the
same personality

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:10%
and the same knowledge
of who we are.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So if we are trying
to figure out

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:84%
many ways of understanding
the knowledge of the universe,

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:90%
we needed to stop that.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And we needed more life
and more evolution.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the species
in the fourth dimension

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:90%
were forced to die.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:10%
Death was the main creation to
end with this eternal system

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:10%
of process of life.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So the transcendence of
a process of learning

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:90%
became death.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:10%
And integration
became to be old.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:10%
And the process
of experimentation

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:10%
became to be the reproduction.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And the expression
was to be born.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the beings
in the fourth dimension

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:84%
were, for the first
time, creating

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
beings in the third
dimension through dying.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's why dying
is so important for us

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, because
it allows the beings in all

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions to express
the different ways of life

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and the different ways in which
we can learn from ourselves.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:10%
The only way you can evolve is
by adapting to the environment.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:10%
And the beings from the Earth
species and the water species--

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.060 align:middle line:10%
they found out that if
they changed their shapes,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:10%
they could be more eternal, that
if they are always the same.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So they figured out that if
they change their shapes being

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:19.480 align:middle line:84%
the same within, they could
upload more information

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and download more information
from the whole universe.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:10%
So that's why the process of
death, the process of dying,

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:10%
of ending something
was so important.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Because it helps to
finish a perspective

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:90%
and begin another one.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.660 align:middle line:10%
For all the beings
that we evolved

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:10%
from the species of water,
we are the living proof

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:10%
that we always are,
were, and will be water,

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:10%
but we are only
changing the shapes.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Water has the whole
information to create life,

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
to express the realities
in different ways.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But those ways need
to be experienced.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So Earth, minerals
has to shape it.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So along the whole history
and evolution of the galaxy,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
minerals were conditioning water
to shape it in different ways,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
so it could be holding
some information

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.390 align:middle line:84%
or recording some information
from every part of the universe

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and every part of the planet.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the beings
living in other planets

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and other dimensions
needed minerals

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to condition the structure
of the water of every being,

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:84%
so their own information
could transcend

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:90%
through time and space in life.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why the universe
created this spiral of DNA

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
in which all information was
held into the cell, which

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:90%
is like a planet.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And all this information
was being alive--

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
through the minerals
and the water

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
that was brought
through the blood.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.720 align:middle line:10%
When we think about
intelligent species,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:10%
we usually start to
think about that humans

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:10%
are not from Earth, and that
we were created by beings

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:10%
from outside, which is true.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:10%
But to understand how
it works, it's not

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:10%
beings from outer space
that came to this planet,

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:10%
and pick some species, and just
decided to create a new one.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They spent thousands
and millions

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.680 align:middle line:84%
of years of observation,
trying to understand

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:90%
how this planet works.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to think
about how your body has

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
its own immunological system,
that anything from outside

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
could be killed by
your own body if it

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel that it's its own.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:10%
So they had to do--

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:10%
is to see which cells of this
body, what we call Earth,

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:10%
were able to evolve and to
hold information from outside.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
At the first stages of the
test, life was only in water.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They start to prove with this
joint of information of blood,

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of DNA in the beings
living in water.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So after a while, they
decided that the best being

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to hold all that
information and to be wise

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:90%
about it was the whale.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And they then tried to cross
the Earth beings with the water

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And most of them didn't
accomplish the purpose

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
of our fathers and mothers
from the stars, like some cats,

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
like some reptilians,
some beings that were--

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
tried to be created from
mammals, from reptilians,

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:90%
from birds.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And those were the
first ideas to reach.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Which one of the species
were more prepared to hold

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:90%
all that information?

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:90%
Then in Africa, the hominids--

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:84%
they were the evolutionary
path in which the Earth

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
was reaching consciousness.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It was not just
monkeys going around

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly a species
from the heavens

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
came and modified them
to create Homo sapiens.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.480 align:middle line:90%
They chose them.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:90%
They chose us.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:10%
Because they saw
that the planet was

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:10%
going into this evolutionary
path in which the planet was

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:10%
looking for being
aware of who she is.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:10%
So they saw that
this species were

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:10%
one of the more prepared
to receive information,

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:10%
because they were
looking for information.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
chose humans, because we

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
were able genetically
to download information

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
from other levels to
understand who we are.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in Africa when
they saw that the hominids were

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
getting ready to
wander the world,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to think about the world in
a different way, they chose--

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.880 align:middle line:84%
took samples of them in
South Africa in Congo,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, in Arabia, in
the Middle East, and India.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And they took the
path that humans

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
were taking, because of the
climate change at that time.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So they were reaching
that information.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But they were
taking those mammals

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to prepare them in
spaces that they

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
would be able to protect them.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the first
humanity, the first humans

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:90%
as we know it--

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.640 align:middle line:84%
they usually were
born in islands.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:90%
They took really far away--

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:11.430 align:middle line:84%
so they could prepare original
people from Australia.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
They start to-- created
different prototypes of humans,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
so they could decide
which one of them

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:84%
was better to mix
with other humans.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of the species were
doing the transformation

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:90%
through genetics.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So they were doing experiments
and tests with humans

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to put that information.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And by tests, I don't mean
in laboratories or hospitals.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sex, because
a lot of them

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
came here to have daughters and
sons with women on this planet.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And also, women came from other
places to have kids with men

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:90%
here on this planet.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Because they
understood that biology

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is the best way to mix
them in a laboratory.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was trying
to mix their genetics.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And other ones just
put the information

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.070 align:middle line:90%
through minerals or to codes.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:10%
During the process of
looking for the best species

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:10%
to hold information
in this planet,

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:32.100 align:middle line:10%
every code of genetics of
different races of this galaxy

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:10%
weren't able to survive.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything that was trying
to survive in this planet--

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
they were killed by this planet.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And in between all
of them, the ones

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:84%
that did it better, because
they were more similar to us

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:90%
were the Arcturians.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Homo sapiens
were the chosen species

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.630 align:middle line:84%
in this planet, because all the
other ones couldn't make it.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:10%
Arcturians figured out that we
were really similar to them.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.640 align:middle line:10%
They were aware that
we were ready to have

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.910 align:middle line:10%
the same proportions of
body, of thoughts, the brain.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything was so aligned
to what Arcturians

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
were trying to do
on Earth, that we

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
were chosen like a good
species to bring consciousness

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.210 align:middle line:90%
to the planet.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:10%
But because they didn't want
to make the same mistakes

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:10%
that they did in
other planets, they

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:46.090 align:middle line:10%
couldn't create just one
perspective of that species.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we needed races.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
We needed different
types of humans

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:84%
to have or to adopt to
different types of information.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the races
were so important.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And the diversity of
humans around the world

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.470 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:90%
So we can have more data.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.550 align:middle line:84%
We can have more information
from every part of the galaxy.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:18.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why we needed this Homo
sapiens being so different,

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time,
being the same species.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
only way that we

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
can have all this information
in just one spot, in just one

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:28.750 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
The structure of the universe
has three stages in which--

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.320 align:middle line:84%
has to be aware of
themselves, is the three steps

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that we have to take in order to
understand who the universe is.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:10%
The first stage is the mental.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:84%
The second stage
is the emotional.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:90%
The third stage is the physical.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
These stages are--
each one of them--

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.630 align:middle line:90%
dividing into other trinities.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
These trinities emerged
from the first one,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.070 align:middle line:84%
creating three other
fractalizations of itself.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:90%
And those divide in three again.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:10%
So what we start to
have is a multiplication

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:10%
of this structure
of trinities that

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:10%
brings us to have nine processes
to be aware in the mind

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:10%
level of consciousness,
then nine in the emotional,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:10%
and nine in the
physical, what we

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:10%
call the nine dimensions in
every stages of the universe.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:84%
This nine then has to become
aware to create a new reality.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what we call the 10th.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And the 10th realized
that he needs

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to split again to see
himself and to create

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:90%
a new reality, which is 11.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So 11:11:11 are
the codes in which

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.670 align:middle line:10%
we could realize that is the
path towards enlightenment

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:10%
and recognized the whole
consciousness in the three

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:10%
stages of the universe.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.420 align:middle line:10%
That's why when we
see this number,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:10%
11:11:11 it's the
code that makes

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:10%
us know that we are ready to
put all the patterns together

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:10%
and to work for the divine.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:10%
This means that we-- has
passed through the nine

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:10%
steps of initiation in mind,
the nine steps of initiation

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.560 align:middle line:10%
in emotions, the ninth
step of initiaion

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:10%
in the physical world.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So we realize who we
are, which is 10th.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we start to create
a new reality, which is 11.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:10%
These three levels-- when we
realize about all of them,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:10%
we discover the number 33.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:10%
33 is a sacred
number for everyone

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:10%
for history and geometry.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Because 33 are the spots
of the whole structure

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
of creation.

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.390 align:middle line:84%
When we put all the geometries--
the tetrahedron, the cube,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:10.440 align:middle line:84%
the octahedron, icosahedron,
and dodecahedron-- altogether,

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.700 align:middle line:84%
what we will find
is that you will

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
have 20 portals,
plus 12 other portals

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
in the structure
of the geometry.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So that is 32, all looking
into just one, which

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:90%
is in the middle, the 33rd.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:10%
The 33 structures of the
consciousness of the universe

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.660 align:middle line:10%
makes us know that we
have 33 ways in which we

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:10%
could bring the information
to our bodies, to our souls.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
around 33 blood

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.920 align:middle line:84%
types in this planet
for humans that

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:84%
had the codes along every
culture, every race,

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.930 align:middle line:90%
every species of humans.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:03.930 align:middle line:84%
We have these 33 codes, so
we could download information

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:84%
from the 33 notes
of the planet, which

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
are aligned emotionally in our
mind through the 33 vertebrae

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.770 align:middle line:90%
from our spine.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:10%
So in mind, in
body, and emotion,

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:10%
we are aligned and bounded
by the code 33, which

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:10%
would be the realization
of the understanding

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:10%
of the whole universe
and the universal mind

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.390 align:middle line:10%
within ourselves.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:10%
That's why the 33 is
a code that we all

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:10%
have to reach at the
moment when we recognize

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:10%
that we are god in blood.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The most common blood types for
humans are O, A, AB, and Rh.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:90%
We all have that.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
But indeed, we have many more.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.250 align:middle line:84%
We have these
different types that

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:09.010 align:middle line:84%
are bounded to our
evolutionary experience.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.120 align:middle line:10%
So these minerals
attached to the blood

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:10%
has the information of 22
races in different planets,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.530 align:middle line:10%
plus the ones that we have
here in this planet Earth.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So every human has these four
different types of blood.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But also, we have a lot of
humans with more, almost 33

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of them that are divided
in different regions

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So we could here be a Noah's
Ark of the information

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:45.940 align:middle line:84%
of every planet and
evolution of this own planet.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So if 33 is the code
to enlighten humanity

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and we all in our
blood have for sure

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:84%
those 33 codes that are
divided in different regions

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.230 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So if we work all
together, we'll

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.630 align:middle line:84%
reach the 33, which is
enlightenment of Earth.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.690 align:middle line:84%
For all the beings
in the galaxy--

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.640 align:middle line:84%
it was important to
choose some spots

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.450 align:middle line:84%
in different solar systems to
keep the seeds of genetics,

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to keep the seeds
of information.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And humans are one of
those that were chosen

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to be this garden
of the galaxy where

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
we could have all
the data in just one

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.800 align:middle line:90%
tiny spot in this solar system.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's important for us humans
to have all this information.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Because in the future,
we are the ones

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be
populating the galaxy.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.190 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones going
outside this planet

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and go to Mars, and
Jupiter, and to other places

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:90%
in other solar systems.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we are going to
reach Sirius, and Pleiades,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and other places in
the future that humans

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
will be able to adapt.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Because within, we
have that information

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.200 align:middle line:84%
of how it is to live
in those planets.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
for us to practice

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:84%
how it is to be aligned with
every one of those planets.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Because by the moment when
we reach the whole galaxy,

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.990 align:middle line:90%
we will know the galaxy.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And we will know what
to do with the galaxy.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode, we will
explore the Pleiades and Bootes

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.080 align:middle line:10%
star system where the first
experiments with species began.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:10%
