00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> How did alien species become
gods and goddesses on Earth?

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
dive into the origin

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.540 align:middle line:10%
of our mythology.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
The society we have
today was created

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:84%
through the ideas of
polytheism and monotheism,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:84%
monotheism through
Christianity and Judaism

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and Islam, and polytheism
through the ideas of Rome

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and the civilization they
created through the republic

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and empire, and Greece
study of philosophy.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So these two paths through
understanding the divine

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
on Earth were taken
from different ideas

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:90%
that came from just one spot.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Monotheism was trying to
explain how the universe was

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
just one mind, one
being, expressed

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:90%
in many different ways.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And these ways were the
faces of the polytheism that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
honor every one of them
in order to be related

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and to download
information of god

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in different perspectives
and different dimensions.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So everyone could have a way we
could connect with the wills,

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
with the wisdom,
with the love of god

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:90%
in different perspectives.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
This main idea of how
polytheism and monotheism were

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:84%
built in the history of
humanity was also bounded

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.610 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of other beings
coming from different planets

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:90%
and different stars.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
That is why we
sometimes had confusion

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about gods,
goddesses, and priests

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
and priestess.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The idea of human gods on Earth
was created in Atlantean time.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was guided
by the Arcturians

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:90%
and the Orion people.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So we could recognize
the power that we

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:84%
had within, in our blood and
in our cells, through the DNA.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:10%
They said that every god, in
reality, was just a projection.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:10%
So what we have to do
was to honor the sun

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:10%
as a projection of god.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.040 align:middle line:10%
And after that, we have to
become the sun ourselves.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So the seek of enlightenment
was to transform humans in suns,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:90%
in moon, and stars on Earth.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
The main concept of the
universal god and goddess

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
was to understand
that the divine was

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:84%
divided in different
levels of consciousness.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So every dimension has a way
to understand the divine.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the matter, the divine
was understood through nature.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Nature was the first
code to understand

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
how everything worked and
how the universe worked.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Life was coming through
water, so we put a divine

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:90%
into every water.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And we split it in
different levels of water--

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
the sea god, the rain,
the lakes, the river.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So we had different perspectives
of what the water was.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:84%
That happened also with the
fire, with earth, with air.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:90%
And every concept of nature--

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:90%
like plants, like animals--

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
had their way to be understood
through the different shapes

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.860 align:middle line:90%
to get to the main core.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, for us,
the biggest concepts of gods

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
were the ones coming
from the sky--

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
moon, sun, the stars.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Those were the concepts that
created our realities on Earth.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And we thought they
were separated.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
We understood that the
skies and all the concepts

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
in the unreachable reality
were the most divine.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the ones we
could touch were the ones

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that were created in
order to us to be in touch

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:90%
with the realities evolved.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why we
compare the flowers

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:90%
with the light of the sun.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And we reach the
enlightenment of the sun

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:84%
through the petals
of the flowers.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the idea
of chakras and enlightenment

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So for us, the
different realities

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that we have seen every day
that helped us to understand

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
the power of creation
in this reality

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
would help us to understand
the idea of that we were all

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
connected through this
god in different shapes.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So this was something that every
human, since the very beginning

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:84%
when we started to realize
who we were on Earth,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
this was the concept
that bound us all,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that every human in every
part of the world understood,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that all the
concepts from above--

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:90%
the sun, the moon, the stars--

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:84%
were the ones creating
this reality on Earth.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were creating
us through their image.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So that is why when in history
the Aessir, the Nemnir,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Alithir, and other beings
from the confederation

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and not from the
Confederation-- all of them

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
started to come to this
planet from the skies.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And that made the idea for
humans to understand that,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
if those people
came from the stars,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
so they are gods from the stars.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones bringing that
creation, that information.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
That created for us the idea
that those beings coming

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, from the
stars, from the moon

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.580 align:middle line:84%
were the beings that
represented the divine on Earth.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we
begin to treat them

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:90%
like gods and goddesses.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The first time in
humanity, when we

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
started to recognize
the divine, we

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
used vibration words to define
the energy of every god.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.624 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we call the giver
of the spirit like "ah," "in,"

00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:46.424 align:middle line:90%
an.

00:06:46.424 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And other words--
like mu, like ath--

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
they were concepts
of humans to put

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
some vibrations in the
understanding of everything.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Ha, ar, ink were words
that represented the divine

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:90%
in a package of information.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
When we were saying ar or an,
we were talking about the sky.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So we were-- every word
or every information

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that we were willing
to give to our kids,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to other cultures, when we
would say ar or an, these two

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
words will represent
all information in just

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:90%
one small sentence.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So this vibration would
represent the whole package

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
of information of the skies.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So when Aessir came
and they saw that we

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.760 align:middle line:84%
were naming these
concepts of gods,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with
different vibration,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:84%
with different names,
so what they did

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
was to say to people that
they were those an, ar, ink,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:90%
those vibrations and blood.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So every one of them took the
name of the gods of the divine

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that we try to understand.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So when we were willing
to talk to the sun,

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:90%
now we had to go to a temple.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And this temple was the
house of this being.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So they would say, if you
want to honor the sun,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to come and
give something to me

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
so I can give the
message to the sun.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
And this created an idea
of pyramidal civilization

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.000 align:middle line:84%
in which the divine
was only achieved

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:90%
through the gods on Earth.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
This disconnected humanity from
the process of the trinity,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
from the process of the
realities that we were trying

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:90%
to achieve in the divine.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And it created the idea that
these gods and goddesses

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:84%
were the only ones
that we could talk to,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.610 align:middle line:90%
to whom we could relate to.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
aren't scared of them.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:90%
We took them like gods.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And they could do whatever
they wanted with us, because we

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
understood that they were
those messengers of gods

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
During the process of
creation, of humanity,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and the society of humanity,
this Aessir, this Annunaki,

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:90%
was spreading in the world.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
conquer every human species

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and every human idea
of the creation.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were
against the first two

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
species that were trying
to help us with the wisdom.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:10%
Those were the Nemnir
and the Sofnir.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:10%
The Nemnir were the
voices of nature on Earth.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So they were called the
giants, or the gods,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the first gods on
Earth that were

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the keepers of the information
of this planet and the nature.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
the Soffhir were
the next ones that

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
gave us the information
of the tree of life,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of how
everything was created.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the snake was
related to this tree that

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:90%
gave us the fruit of wisdom.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And they worked by themselves
alone, in separate regions.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So they were really
difficult to get--

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
they were really difficult
to be in touch with.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of Nemnir
and Soffhir, for humans,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:84%
were really
difficult to achieve.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Aessir were
so important for humans,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
because they were related with
humans most than other species.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And they claimed to be the
protectors of humanity,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
even if half of them were
trying to control us.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the Aessir started
to fight the first species,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
like Nemnir and Soffhir, so
they could rule the whole world.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:10%
And they claim themselves
like those protecting humans

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:10%
from the species like
snakes and the giants.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:10%
Aessir took the
idea that humanity

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:10%
understood that they
were gods, because they

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:10%
came from the skies.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And they start to control every
civilization and every species

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
that they were creating like
the messengers of the divine.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
They became the middle point to
connect the self with humanity.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:10%
And that's why, when humans
were ready to become the species

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:10%
to control the planet,
the other new giants

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:10%
came to this planet who were the
Arcturians, the Orion people,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:10%
and Sirian people.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
These people came
after all the mess

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that Aessir had
created in this planet.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we are
the new messengers

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:90%
from other dimensions.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We are bounded to the fifth
and the sixth dimension.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were just using
you to reach their own goals

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:90%
in this planet.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were split
in those who were protecting

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
humanity, and those who
were pretending that they

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:90%
were protecting humanity.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And they sent them
all to what we now

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
call Hell, which is
in the underground.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The keepers of the
underground would take them

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
in the underground
cities so humans

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:84%
could be rulers of the new
civilization of the new world.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
That's how Arcturians, Orion
people, and Sirian people,

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
they became the new
gods for humans.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:90%
But they were not called gods.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember one of them
that we used to call Yusa.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And he-- she--

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:84%
was someone that was
called a god on Earth.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
She was teaching to
people how to relate

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
with the divine on the stars.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one of
the Atlantean people

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
asking her in the
temples of the desert,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
why are you allowing
that people call you god

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:90%
if you are not a god?

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:10%
And she would say, I never
said to them to be called god.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%
But I am a part of god.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have any problem
with people believing who I am,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:90%
because I am.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were teaching
people how to become gods.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:10%
And if they would say
they were not gods,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:10%
we would never want to
reach their same level

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:10%
We wanted to be like them.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they allowed
people to call them

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:84%
gods, so we could reach the
idea of how to be a god.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Arcturians,
Orion people were called gods.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But they were not forcing
people to be called like that.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:84%
These beings, they
prepare humans

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to make the path to become
gods and goddesses on Earth.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And these teachings--
after the Aessir were

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.630 align:middle line:84%
sent to the underground,
these teachings

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:84%
created the idea of
civilizations becoming divine

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
taught their sons--

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
the sons in Mu, in Khem
and Khef, Atlantis,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:84%
they taught them how to do the
path to become divine on Earth.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And those were the first
priests and priestesses

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that incarnated the concepts of
the divine of other dimensions

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the people from
Atlantis, for all the humans,

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
became also the
concepts of gods.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They were not trying
to be called gods.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:10%
But they were guiding
people to become gods.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they allowed
every human to call them

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.110 align:middle line:90%
gods on Earth, human gods.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The main representative
of gods that we

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:84%
had in the Atlantean times
where Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:84%
This trinity for us
is the most important,

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's the latest
one being created

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and is the one that shaped
idea of who we are today

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:90%
as a society.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:84%
These were three
priests and priestesses

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantean times that
where the incarnation

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
of the concepts of the mother
of the divine, the father

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
of the divine, and the creation
itself, the sun, the light,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:90%
which will be Horus.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
This family, these
three people, were

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:84%
living beings, human
beings that represented

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:84%
the concepts of the divine
that are the first time they

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:90%
call in different ways.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
We call this trinity of
divine Shu, Tefnut, and Geb.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was the creation
between heaven and Earth.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And these gods were not people.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They were concepts of nature.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:10%
After that, we had
the feminine time

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:10%
of creation, what we could
call the goddess Nut, Maat,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:10%
and Hathor.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:10%
Nut, Maat, and Hathor would
be this feminine trinity

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.380 align:middle line:10%
that represented the
stars, the sky, the seven

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:10%
laws of the universe,
and the mother itself

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:10%
who creates every law and
every star in the sky.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So this trinity was brought
to our material world

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
through the Aessir, through the
ancient concepts of the divine.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:10%
And that meant that
every woman representing

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:10%
the divine on Earth would be
part of Hathor, Maat, and Nut.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
That made Isis, the
priestess of Atlantis,

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.339 align:middle line:84%
the incarnation of what
we call the holy mother.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
The image of Isis
was the incarnation

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:90%
of this divine mother.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And Osiris was the incarnation
of every god through fertility.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So Osiris had to go
through all the creation

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:84%
like he was representing
this idea of god being

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:90%
bred in every part of reality.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So all the concepts
of the divine

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:84%
was fertilizing the
whole river Nile.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:10%
This idea became a
myth in which Osiris

00:17:55.090 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:10%
was cut in different pieces
so it could be seeded

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:10%
in every part of the Nile.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And then Isis, the mother, would
put all these parts together

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
to create the
enlightenment, which

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
would be the sun, Horus,
the sun that represented

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:90%
the unification of every part.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But they were people that
represented these histories

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:84%
through the temples where
they were living in.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.450 align:middle line:84%
For us in the past,
the divine of the sky

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
was the divine of sun, then
the divine of the moon,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:90%
and the divine of Earth.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The trinity of the
sun was the concept

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that we name like
Ra, Amun, Atun.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And these were the three
steps in which the light

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.310 align:middle line:90%
was expressed in a universe.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:10%
But then we had
the moon, the one

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.820 align:middle line:10%
that put all the order
on this reality, which

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:10%
would be Nut, Maat, and Hathor.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:10%
And from them, they created the
Earth, so Shu, Geb, and Tefnut.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:10%
And these three levels of
consciousness and concepts

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:10%
of the divine were incarnated
in the families of Atlantis

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:10%
in three also different
levels of these three divines

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:10%
which were, for the sun,
the trinity of Osiris, Isis,

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:10%
and Horus.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
For the moon, it was the trinity
of Djehuty, Seshat, and Hornup.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the Earth was the trinity
of Seth, Nephthys, and Anubis.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
These three trinities were
the priests and priestesses

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
incarnating the
concepts of the divine

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that we had from
the very beginning.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:10%
And they were the
Atlantean people

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:10%
that tried to
teach to humans how

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:10%
to understand the concepts
of light in the moon,

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:10%
light in the Earth,
and light in the sun.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:10%
So that's why the feminine
aspect of the divine mother

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.870 align:middle line:10%
incarnated in Nephthys,
Isis, and Seshat

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:10%
was the divine mother that we
still today call Mother Mary.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:10%
All the concepts
of the divine world

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:10%
were transcended from the
polytheism to the monotheism

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:10%
so we could still have it.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
The god that is spread
around all the universe

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:84%
in different parts,
which we call god,

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
was put in the womb
of this Holy Mother

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and create the sun that
represent the darkness,

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:90%
the light, and the wisdom.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So we had the holy
spirit incarnated

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
in the sun and light
of the universe

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
that today we call Jesus Christ.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:10%
But for ancient ones, they
were called the trinity

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.585 align:middle line:10%
of Hornup, Anubis, and Horus.

00:21:10.585 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
For Atlantean people, the
families, the 12 families,

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
represented the trinities
that the divine created here

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
in different levels
of consciousness.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
When the divine was split in
many thousands and millions

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
of parts, there were
just 12 structures

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:84%
that represent them all, that
united every aspect of reality.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So these 12 structures in
different dimensions-- that,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
in six dimension, were the six
positive realities of Elohim

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and the six negative
realities of Elohim--

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
they structure the idea of the
divine in different concepts

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
that were brought to our reality
through the constellations.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So every human knew them
because of the constellations.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And when the Aessir and
other beings from the galaxy

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
came from those
constellations, we

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
attached them to 12
different gods and goddesses

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that were related to the
information of these 12.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And when Thallon
had these 12 kids

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to create the first humans
that were after that modified

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:84%
by the Arcturians
and the Orion people,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
they created the concept
of the 12 families

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
that created the priest
and priestesses that

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:84%
represented the divine on
Earth in a human shape.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
That's how we have 12
concepts of the divine

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:84%
in different dimensions,
12 people from the stars

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
represented here on
Earth, the aliens that

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:90%
were called gods and goddesses.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:10%
And then we have the 12
families from human beings

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:10%
that were called the priests
and priestesses or gods

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:10%
and goddesses in human shape.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
These different
families or concepts

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
were treated then
like trinities.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:10%
So there were 12
trinities that represented

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:10%
the houses of the stars on Earth
through blood and through DNA.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
These 12 houses were represented
by one, the sun, the other one

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:84%
the moon, and the other
one the underground,

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
which was the darkness.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
four pillars, which

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:90%
is earth, water, air, and fire.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
These four houses
gives the other

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:84%
three that represents the
trinity of the divine, which

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.160 align:middle line:90%
is the will, love, and wisdom.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And they are all bounded by
two houses called the space

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:52.290 align:middle line:90%
and time.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
These 12 faces of reality,
these 12 trinities that

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:84%
were born through the
blood of the Aessir,

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and also the
Arcturian people, they

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:84%
created in matter the
keepers of this information,

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.460 align:middle line:90%
of these houses, through blood.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And that is why
they were related

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:10%
with the gods and
goddesses on Earth,

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:10%
because in their own blood, they
had the patterns, the story,

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:10%
the history of their families
coming from the stars,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:10%
from the portals in
those constellations.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were
called gods and goddesses

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.050 align:middle line:90%
on Earth in human shape.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:10%
So the concepts and
the ideas that we

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:44.220 align:middle line:10%
have of gods and goddesses today
is really mistaken by history,

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:10%
because the concepts
of gods were

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:10%
taken by different beings--

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:10%
aliens, priests-- to try to
explain in different times,

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:10%
in different levels,
in different temples,

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:10%
different schools what
they really represented.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:10%
And that is why, when we
think about Egyptian gods

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:10%
and goddesses-- which
were the first ones,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:10%
with the Sumerian people, to
organize the pantheon of all

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:10%
the gods--

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:10%
what we have about
them is this idea

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:10%
of a divine that
represented through people

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:10%
that came from the
stars and people that

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:10%
were alive in ancient times.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:84%
That is why we cannot understand
the divine through the people

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and the gods that were
living in history.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to go farther
and beyond the concept

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:90%
that they represented.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:84%
There were not many
gods in history.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
There were many people,
humans, and people

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
from Aessir, Annunaki
that represented

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.370 align:middle line:84%
a concept of the divine
that every being had

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
in the whole universe
and that they were just

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
trying to explain
it or represent it

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:84%
so humans could understand
it and be ruled by it.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explain

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
how these priests
and priestesses

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
could channel information
from other dimensions.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.020 align:middle line:10%
