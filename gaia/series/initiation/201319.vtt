[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:13.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, when it started, it
was when I was between 11 and 12

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:10%
years old.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:10%
I was always connected to
my guides since I was born.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I was able to see them all
the time, at school, home,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.740 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was this day that
I went to eat something,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
to eat hamburgers
with some friends,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, two
of them appear.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.106 align:middle line:84%
Like a McDonald's, but
it wasn't McDonald's.

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So they appeared
there, and they told me

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that, in seven days
from that time,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I would start to
remember everything

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I've done before I was
born, and that I will not

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
be able to see them anymore but
I would be able to feel them.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
In order to survive to
all my memories coming,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I had to follow what they
taught me when I was a kid.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So they taught me
a lot of things,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.320 align:middle line:84%
so it was really useful
when I started to remember.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So in between 11
and 12 years old, I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.720 align:middle line:90%
went to school that next week.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:84%
They gave us a paper, history,
for ancient civilizations

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:90%
like 3,000 years before--

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the
picture of the pyramid,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I just had a headache.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And all the images
with emotional stuff

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
came, like I saw myself
in front of the Sphinx

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:90%
with the face of a lion.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:90%
I was a woman.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
There was my
husband there and we

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
were worried about
something that I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:90%
have listened in a reunion.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So all these adult things
when I was 12 years old.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it
started, and every day

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
was a different memory from
my families, from everyone

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.390 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I was able to see
them like that.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Then it was something,
really, like a cloud

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
with a human shape, normally
without a face, just eyes

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.130 align:middle line:90%
and a round head with light.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, I listened to them
here, vibrating in the heart.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I
was able to see them.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Then I couldn't
see them anymore.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:90%
When I was 17, I saw them again.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Then I stopped seeing.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I was
24, I saw them again.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's for periods that I can
see them or just hear them.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.853 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was never scary
because I was born seeing them.

00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:90%
For me, it was normal.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.470 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was like a
brother or an uncle that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:84%
went away for a trip
and then they went back.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:90%
It was something like that.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
I was only scared of my darkness
guides that sometimes used

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to come, and they were weird.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
scary the first time,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
but then I wasn't
scared anymore because I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
knew why they were there.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
But no, for me--

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
they only changed their
aspects according to my age

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:90%
so I was more related to them.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Like when I was a kid, they
would be tiny and sometimes

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
with animal shapes.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And they would play with
me and they would teach me

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:90%
stuff like in a kid language.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they started to
come like tall persons, not

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
small beings, and that's
how I was related to them.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:90%
So no, it was not scary, never.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was weird,
of course, at school

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:84%
to get related to the
people because everyone

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:84%
was willing to do stuff
that I don't want to do,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:84%
even though my guides and other
beings that I was able to see,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
they would always tell me,
you have to be like a human.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have to play,
you have to-- you know?

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
They were teaching me that I
needed to learn about emotions,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
that I had to be there,
like if it was a trip to,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, the
rain forest and I was

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:90%
looking at monkeys in school.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So I had these friends
from other dimensions

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that really helped me to
understand how society was

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and not to judge it.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was difficult
because a lot of people

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.440 align:middle line:90%
didn't understand.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But I was lucky because
my family was agnostic,

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%
so they had no beliefs.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
They had no thoughts
about this stuff.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And how do you say the
director of the school?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
She also believed in this
stuff, and some teachers too.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So they would help
me a lot, even

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.680 align:middle line:84%
if the others didn't
understand, and also my friends.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:90%
So I was really lucky.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:90%
I cannot say it was bad for me.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Emotion.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was like emotion.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's like when you
try to remember something

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
that you have done or
that happened to you.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It is like the feeling, and
then the images start to come.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Mostly, it was like that.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it was
like a big headache

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and like a package
of information,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
like doing
[ZIPPING SOUND] like this.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
how do you say these files
that you have that zip,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
the WinRAR files that
you have in the computer.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, it was like--

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:90%
geometrically, it opened.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was images
and many stuff,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and my brain was trying
to attach to all of that

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it was more
emotional than information.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to my guides,
why do I have to suffer this?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, because all the
information in the universe

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
is attached to energy, and the
energy in your body is emotion.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can open
those files is through emotion.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records
is everywhere.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
They are the connection
in between every electron,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:90%
every atom.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything is connected by that.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not a place.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I used to describe
it like a library

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
because it was easy
to explain how it was.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it is like a
network of vibration that

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:90%
goes and connects everything.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And the words, the
books, are like spheres

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
similar to the electrons
that spin all the time.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
So you are the construction
of the Akashic Records.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
You are a file, so you
can open those files.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:90%
So everyone can do it.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But I used to describe
it like a public library.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You can take the books, but then
you have to deliver it back.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You cannot just do whatever with
a book or break it because you

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:90%
can do a mess with information.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be
really balanced

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to get into the Akashic Records.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I was not getting into
the Akashic Records.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I just remember I worked there.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I used to describe my job
there like a positive electron

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:90%
in a cable through internet.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.727 align:middle line:90%
I was just doing that.

00:08:32.727 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:90%
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
That's my spirit.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:84%
That was all, but
it was amazing.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:45.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, my mom was a
very creative person,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
so she saw me like a
very creative person, so

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
a lot of imagination, a good
mind to create stuff, to paint,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
to tell stories.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So she would never tell
me, don't talk about this,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
When things started to be heavy,
like I started to have problems

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
at school, I started
to see darkness

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't
handle many emotions,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I was crying for people that
have died thousands of years

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I felt responsible
for countries.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It was so many things that
she started to worry about,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:84%
but she would never
say that I was crazy.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:84%
She would always look for
people to understand me.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And she was always
looking for people

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to help me to organize
the information in my head

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and not to say that
this was not true.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother, she just
started to listen to me

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and I began to explain all
this stuff when I was 19 or 18.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
She always knew that I was
weird, but a good weird.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But from that moment
I explained to her

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
what was happening to me, she
just started to ask me stuff.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And she just said, oh, I'm
thankful that your granddad is

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.295 align:middle line:90%
dead because he was more mental.

00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:90%
And the ones that--

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.600 align:middle line:84%
my auntie was the
one that it was

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
most difficult to
understand everything.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:90%
She had thought I was crazy.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, all my
family and friends

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
were like, oh, tell me more.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:90%
So that was good.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess that the most
important I can talk about

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:90%
is what happened in the Vatican.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.140 align:middle line:84%
There's thousands,
but I guess that one,

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I received information that we
had to turn the vibration off

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:90%
of the biggest key in the world.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I was, in 2012, doing a trip
around the world seeding keys,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
copper keys in the
world so I could

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
open the doors of energy for
all my job after doing that.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I arrived
to Antarctica--

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I was in Antarctica
December 21, 2012.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was a whole
other story, a fun story.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But when I was there, the
information I received

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
was, now you have to wait for
the big lightning in February

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:90%
2013.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And after March 2013,
the energy of the south

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:90%
would be in the north.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And when the energy of the
south is settled in the north,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
you will be able
to open and to turn

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
the biggest key in the world
that would turn every key.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what it was until we

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
saw the lightning coming in
February 2013 into the Vatican.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And that lightning was the
same day that the pope quit

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Argentinian pope became
the pope, so from the south

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:90%
to the north.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest key in
the world is the Vatican

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
because St. Peter's
Cathedral was

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.890 align:middle line:84%
built by Bernini with the shape
of a key, the key of heaven.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So they would say, you have
to turn from north to south

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:90%
the key in order to do it.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And because the pope
was Argentinian,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:06.110 align:middle line:84%
it was easier to
get to him for me.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So the good story about all
that was that my guides told me

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
that I had to go to Rome and
sit in a specific spot of Rome

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:90%
to wait for a call.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And I went there.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So I sat there and I
was waiting for a call,

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and I just put a picture
in Instagram in 2014,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
here waiting for
the pope's call.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And it was fun for me.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in Scotland,
there was a friend

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
that was in a spiritual trip.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying,
oh, Matias is waiting

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%
for the call of the pope.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was this lady
in the same bus that says,

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I am a friend of the
secretary of the pope.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you need the phone?

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So somebody calls me
there in that square,

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was the secretary of the
pope asking, what do you want?

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I don't know.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So I just told him, well,
my guides told me to come

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:84%
to the Vatican to ask for
permission to make a change

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and I cannot do
it if you don't allow me.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
the Vatican and they

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to do this
gathering in the Vatican

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:90%
a few weeks later.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So we went, like 500
people to the Vatican

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:90%
to do this switch of energy.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that,
if it would work,

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
nature would show
that it was possible.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
So during the whole
day in Rome, June 14

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
in 2014, we were working with
the energy of the Vatican.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this big storm
appears just out of nothing.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was news there because
it was so many lightnings.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And we were the only
500 people running

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
in the streets
with the lightnings

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and doing all this
job of energy.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, when the moment
was to open the portal,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
this big lightning, exactly
like the one in February 2013,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.480 align:middle line:84%
goes to the Vatican
and everything

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:84%
starts to vibrate so hard
that we all run to the square.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And we were there,
just opening the--

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
switching the energy,
and suddenly, the sun

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
comes, with all this
rain, this lightning

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
from behind the
cupola of the Vatican,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and two rainbows in the
door of the Vatican opens.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, everything's
clear, and that's it.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So it was like nature working
with us during these hours.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, I was
invited by the secretary

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:84%
to give the pope a message
and to give it in his hands.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.730 align:middle line:90%
And it was not about religion.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
It was because my
guides told me,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
you cannot fight
against the old system.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:84%
You need to love the
old system in order

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
to transform it in love.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would be, always,
fight, fight, fight, fight.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So you should not go against
something that is ending.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:84%
You should go and hug it so
you can transform together.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
goal of that trip.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth and civilization
were, together, working,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
so it was amazing how the
weather showed a portal

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:90%
after we turned the key.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.036 align:middle line:90%
Oh, like me yesterday.

00:16:53.036 --> 00:16:56.438 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:56.438 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing is
that we are always

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:84%
awakening, so there
is no way to escape

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of frustration
or feeling of weirdness

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
or feeling that you are
getting crazy because, in order

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to understand a bigger picture
of how the universe works,

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
you have to break your own mind.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why you kind
of need to become

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.400 align:middle line:84%
a little bit crazy to
understand something bigger.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I would say, don't
take everything

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
so seriously because
it doesn't matter

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:90%
what you see in the universe.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just a perspective
or a hologram,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:90%
so nothing is really true.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So don't take
anything seriously,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
not even what you remember in
the past, other dimensions,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
other beings, darkness,
light, anything.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Anything real is real.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just different
perspectives.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you're opening your
mind, you're just going--

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
these layers in the
onion, that you're just

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:90%
trying to discover the core.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you are trying
to take the layers

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
of every part of the
onion to get to the core,

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:90%
you will cry a lot.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:90%
That's natural.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
suffering involved

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
because it means
that a part of you

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.800 align:middle line:84%
needs to die so other part can
be born and understand itself.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it is so hard,
this process of awakening.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
But we always need to
know that this is die,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.090 align:middle line:90%
born, die, born again.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, don't take
anything so seriously,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and remember that we
created all this to play.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a game, so you have
to learn how to play with it.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:90%
