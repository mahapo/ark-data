00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> What was life like in Khem?

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide Matias de Stefano.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
Khem, the mother civilization

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egypt.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The first time I was supposed
to remember and to understand

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
who I was was when
I was 12 years old.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
My guides told me in
seven days I would

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:90%
start to remember other lives.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
That week the first
memory I had was myself

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
with the body of a woman.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And the man who was my
husband in that life,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
both of us asking
for help and support

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
there in the Bassik, what we
call now the Great Sphinx.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The first image I had
of my entire memories

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
was being there watching the
lion straight to the eyes

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and asking the
Bassik, as we call it,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:84%
for help to support myself in
everything that I had to do

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and that I wouldn't
be able to accomplish.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
From that memory,
from the emotion,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I started to remember
my country, Khem.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I asked my guides why I
had to feel the memories

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and not just to remember them.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And my guides told
me that the memories

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:90%
are bounded by the emotion.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
That we don't remember
stuff just through the mind,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
that we remember where we
have lived through the heart.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
That everything
that you remember

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
is because you felt it,
not because you thought it.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is why most
of the memories that I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
was able to remember from
not only that life but others

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
was because of the emotion that
brought me every memory that I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:90%
was living in.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Since we were kids
in that life, we've

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:84%
been taught about the
importance of our river,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of the spine of the world.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And we were said
that our country was

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the first settlement that the
Atlantean people, the Khefien,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
thought it would become
the New Atlantis.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for us,
it was so important.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And we were so honored to be in
the second mother civilization.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
We were the ones in charge
that all the information

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
of the world would
survive through the night

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
of the galaxy.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:84%
At the time I lived
in Khem, the schools

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, the first
teachings that they were giving

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
to us was the language,
because language was the key

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to understand the realities.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:84%
We knew that the spirit
created everything by singing.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:10%
The singings, the
words, the vibration

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:10%
were the main languages
of the universe.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So we were gifted
with the possibility

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
to talk, to
understand the words,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
patterns of vibration.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
was so important

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
for us to learn the
language as better

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:84%
we can to understand the
meaning of every vibration.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
We settle these concepts of
the divine in different sounds

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:90%
or letters.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
These letters would be
gathering to create concepts.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.890 align:middle line:84%
As our culture was growing,
we understood these vibrations

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:90%
through our environment.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So we start to call the
concepts of the divine

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
according to the vibrations
we have surrounding us.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
How do we speak and how
we used the language

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.250 align:middle line:90%
was very important.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And we divided the people
in vibration of languages.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
We settle the
agriculture people,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the builders of our
towns, the politicians,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
they all has like different
patterns to speak.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And the priests and priestesses
has another totally different.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have kings or queens.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
They were all priests
and priestesses.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And we were changing power.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Like in our democracy today,
we were switching power

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:90%
through the temples.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So each temple has its own time
to rule the country according

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:90%
to what the country was needing.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Our main idea as a country was
that if only one head rules

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
everything and that head
doesn't understand everything,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:90%
so a body could not work.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So according to the needs of
any time, like spring, winter,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
we divided the rulers
of our civilization.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And we just were
rotating the power

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:90%
so the whole body has a voice.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child,
until my seven years,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:84%
we had to learn about
the physical world.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So we had to learn how to handle
the emotions and the body.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So we needed to learn
about how our blood works.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
We needed to learn how to change
the vibration of the water.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Teachers taught us how
to speak with the moon,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
with the water of the sea,
with the blood inside,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and to understand how
everything really was water.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the universe that
has a mind has water within.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So they not only taught
us how to read and listen

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of water
here, but also to listen

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:90%
the thoughts of every planet.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:84%
We could hear the vibration
through time and space,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
because they said water is the
biggest mind of the universe.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you can listen
your own water,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.496 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the
thoughts of the universe.

00:06:59.496 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Atlantean people used
to name our country

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:10%
as Gain-Ebedis, the
place with many beauties

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:10%
and many resources.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:10%
And Gain-Ebedis was known by
us like the great Sut, Tul Sut.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Tul Sut was the great
village, the great population.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
We call the great population
like the great path.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
All of us were the
workers of consciousness.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So we call our country the
path towards the light.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we used
to call it the Sut.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Sut meant that every
town, and every village,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and every little house along
the River Nile, the Tul Fah,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
would be connected like one
country, like one thought.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
The families that ruled
the planet at that time

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
were called the Blue
Ones, the Atil Khef.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And even though we were
coming from the families

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:90%
of Arcturian civilizations--

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
because all our blood was
created by the Arcturians

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:90%
and the humans on Earth--

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:84%
we were also called by
civilization the snake people.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We used to be called
the snake people, not

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
because we were reptilians, but
because we were the ones ruling

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:84%
the snake of the world,
the snake of the river that

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
goes from the earth
to the heavens,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:84%
and then the snake that
was in Anatolia that ruled

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the whole world.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.039 align:middle line:84%
So we were in charge
of the whole region.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we were
called the snake people.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the snakes were
the symbol of our civilization.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Because of history taught
us that the snake gave

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.285 align:middle line:84%
the information to the women,
that is why in our region,

00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
in our culture, women were
in charge of everything.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we understood
that every spirit that

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
was trying to be
born in this planet

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to experience or
transform realities,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
they needed to go through
the womb of a mother.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, for us, it
was the most powerful being.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:10%
That was why the
structure of the society

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:10%
was ruled by women in circles.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.360 align:middle line:10%
Every circle in every
region were the mothers

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:10%
that represented the sons and
daughters that was the society.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And we, as women as
part of the 12 families,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
we needed to learn everything
from this path, everything

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
from the nature,
in order to create

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:84%
a perfect society so the spirits
could live properly in Earth.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
At the time I was there,
we called the capital

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:90%
of the region Ruhnilah.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Ruhnilah was a big city around
what we call now Giza Plateau.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:84%
At the time I was living
there, we had only one pyramid.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
This only one pyramid
was in the middle.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And it has three big
chambers in the corner that

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
were the places where the
priests and priestesses used

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to go to channel the
information of the whole brain.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Every obelisk around
would be like the antenna

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
to bring the information,
to storage the information,

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and to make like
these canals to anchor

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the information of the
highest point of the pyramid.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So whoever goes
inside the pyramid

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and puts the basin
of water, they

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
would sing so loud so
the vibration could rise.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And the patterns
of this vibration

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.970 align:middle line:84%
would activate the highest
point of the pyramid.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
This highest point
would conduct the energy

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.790 align:middle line:84%
from the gold and
the minerals above.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And this charging of
energy would be connected

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:90%
to these pillars around.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So all the information of the
city would be spread around

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and would be used to
connect with the network.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It was like if every human,
every person in the city

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
were like the chargers
of the pyramids.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So at the time we were all
connecting with this pattern,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
the obelisk would hold
this energy in our towns.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And this energy would
activate our memory.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:10%
The priest and
priestesses were the ones

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:58.760 align:middle line:10%
that we call the speakers
with the world, the Arsayian.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:10%
The Arsayian where
those who were

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:10%
able to use the
antennas of reality

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:10%
to bring the information
of the whole world.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
of the whole pattern of
the world, to our city.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:10%
We call Ruhnilah the brain city
because all the information

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:10%
from the network
around in the planet

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:10%
was downloading there or
uploading through them.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:10%
Also we had another
order of priest

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:10%
and priestesses that
we called the Idilien.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:10%
The Idilien were the people
in charge of every element.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:10%
So each one of the Idilien
has a different purpose

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:10%
to work with every
one of those elements.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So as the priests
and priestesses

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
were able to talk with
the world and the planet

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
through the energy
of the people,

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
the Idilien were the ones
working with the alchemy

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to transform those ideas
and those talks and thoughts

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:90%
into matter.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:84%
The Sut was connected
along the River Nile

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:90%
through different ways.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
We had three paths--

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.450 align:middle line:84%
one through water, one through
earth, and the other one

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:90%
through the energy.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:90%
They would sail in boats.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
We would have the
path of initiations

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:90%
that would be walking.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.515 align:middle line:84%
And we also had the
path of the energy.

00:13:24.515 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:10%
The one of the energy was the
most amazing path for all of us

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:10%
because it was this path hold
by these resonance pillars

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:10%
that we call now the Djed.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:10%
And these pillars of
vibration, what they would do

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.220 align:middle line:10%
was allow the South and the
North to send information,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:10%
to send messages, and
to send also materials.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They would send mostly
big blocks of stone.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And they would push them
through this path of vibration.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And they would just go through
and travel through the singings

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of the priests.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
This path was not
used by humans,

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because the humans that would
use this path would disappear,

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:84%
would be brought to the atomic
spectrum, atomic reality.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
priestess would

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:84%
walk outside the
pillars of vibration.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And they would create
this perfect harmony

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
so everything that was inside
was just levitating, flowing.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
We would see sometimes these
pillars from the river.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And the river has changed.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And everything was like
savanna, it was not desert.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:90%
So we could see animals around.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:90%
We could see elephants.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
We could see lions
all over the region.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:10%
So that helped us also
to be related with nature

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:10%
and to understand the different
aspects of the divine that

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:10%
were related to every temple.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:84%
That's how also every temple
adopt its own teaching

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:84%
through the aspects
of nature, bringing

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
the lion, the
ibis, the crocodile

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
as beings that represented
the aspects of the divine.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we used
those animals that

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.530 align:middle line:84%
used to live in that
region as the animals that

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
represented God.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is why thousands
of years after, we

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.965 align:middle line:90%
start to call them gods.

00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.390 align:middle line:84%
This path that
connected South to North

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
through the vibration,
the Great Sut

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.870 align:middle line:84%
it was the one that was
delivering the materials

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
to create every temple in order
to build the perfect being that

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:90%
was our country.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.500 align:middle line:84%
In the period of Atlantis
and Egypt, the Khef and Khem,

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
the buildings they were starting
to make around the planet

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
were for downloaded
this information.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Every temple was like
a different shape

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
in which this download
would be possible.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So humans in those temples,
in those stone circles,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in those cities with
water, these buildings

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
like these pyramids
were buildings

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that helps to bring the
vibration of every timeline

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
in the higher level
vibration of this network,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Mannick network.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:43.630 align:middle line:90%
So we could write it down.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:84%
We can download it in our
bodies, in our energy,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
so that DNA could
awake this information

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensions in
our dimension, in our world.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
In order to do
that, they started

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:84%
to build the pyramid
to create this machine

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:90%
to download this information.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, they had

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:84%
to put every dimension
into the physical shape.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:84%
The first kingdom
to be created was

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:84%
the kingdom of stones,
the kingdom of minerals.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So they understood that
the patterns of geometry

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
were creating these
minerals first.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.829 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we needed
silicon and crystals

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to create these stones
to channel the vibration

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and information through
every dimension.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:90%
Stones were very important.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, even
if we were trying

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
to build spheres in the matter,
or pyramids, the structure

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:84%
to build those other machines,
these machines to download

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the information from
other structures,

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:84%
should be in square
or cube shaped.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
The cube shape would be
the physical way in which

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%
a sphere could be created.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
To be downloaded in our
worlds, we need squares,

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and we need these
patterns of cubes.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why by vibration
we created these cubes

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to build the temples and to
build the pyramids in order

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.605 align:middle line:84%
to hold all this
amount of energy.

00:18:17.605 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
This was understood by the
construction of the chakana.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:10%
The interdimensional chakana
that in South America they know

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:10%
are, in Atlantean times,
was called the Protiktah.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:10%
Protiktah was this energy
with pyramidal shape

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:10%
that goes up, and goes down, and
is built by different groups.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
These different groups relate
every spot of dimensions.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have the ninth
dimension within.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have four dimensions
up and four dimensions below.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So these eight dimensions
holding the first one

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
relates the cube to
the main structure

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
to reach every
information of god,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:90%
of the goddess of the universe.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:10%
So that is why the chakana was
the shape in which every being

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:10%
could understand the
path of evolution

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:10%
and the path of vibration
that a sphere needs in order

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.730 align:middle line:10%
to be created as a
planet, as being,

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:10%
so we could download every
aspect of the universe.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
pyramids were built

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:84%
with cubes and with
these long cubes

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
to download this information
and to hold this vibration

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in this pyramidal shape.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
By multiplying those patterns
of cubes of the chakana,

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.830 align:middle line:84%
they created the
biggest Protiktah, which

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:90%
are the pyramids, below and up.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
These structures
would have four faces

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
in the material world and other
four faces into the timelines.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have four faces for
space, four faces for time.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And the connection
between them would

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
be the positive and the negative
aspects of the vibration.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
That is why when we see
in the third dimension

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:84%
world, the pyramid, we
can see just four faces.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we can see
through time, because

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
of the equinox and
solstice, we would

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
see the shadows of
the pyramids showing

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:90%
that they have other faces.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.690 align:middle line:90%
They have eight faces.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
These eight faces are
only shown by the shadows,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the shadows of the time of
every timeline of solstice

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:90%
and equinox.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.920 align:middle line:84%
These shadows
shows that in order

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to get into the
core of the system,

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:52.500 align:middle line:84%
you need the two energies
flowing in this vibration.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The energies of
space would bring

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:84%
the shape of this
octahedron that creates

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:90%
the seed of the information.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
four faces would

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%
create the wave of
vibration in order

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to reach the perfect
amount of energy

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:90%
we need to open a portal.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
If we could see the
pyramid in two dimensions,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:84%
we would split every face
of the pyramid in a paper.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And we would see
that the lines out

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and the lines in the
structure of the pyramid

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:90%
will draw a wave.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
This wave creates the
pattern to the vibration.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:84%
As lower it is closer to the
ground, the vibration is low.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And this vibration would talk
about the deepest and darkness

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
energies of the world
that are the soil

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:90%
to bring that energy up.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So we needed the low
vibration to connect

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:90%
with the core of the planet.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And as we reach the
top of the pyramid,

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
the high vibration
start to activate

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:84%
every timeline and every
space into one, which

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:90%
is the top of the gold pyramid.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:10%
The gold pyramid up would be the
conductor of all this vibration

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:10%
that every time of the
year, in four times

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:10%
of the year, every equinox
and every solstice,

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.270 align:middle line:10%
would be the perfect times
to connect the network

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:10%
and to align all the information
from the highest vibration

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:10%
network to the physical ones.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:84%
That was the period when
the structure of the network

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Mannick was downloaded
on the planet.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And we could
understand everything.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:90%
We had order in our realities.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But as the school
of knowledge, they

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
would teach us we needed to
download this information

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and record it in the underground
so everyone in the future

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:84%
could upload this
information again.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:10%
At the time the
Era of Leo began,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:10%
we had this temple in front
of the Sphinx called Ptelintur

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:10%
where this information was
brought from the heavens

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.910 align:middle line:10%
to Earth.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:10%
And there was nothing else
but these temples surrounding

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:10%
the Sphinx.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx would be the
keeper of knowledge.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:10%
And under the Sphinx,
what my ancestors built

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:10%
there was the Halls
of Amenti, the storage

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:10%
of knowledge of our history.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:10%
He would protect the
knowledge of our civilization.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And all the path
under the Sphinx

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
would be connecting all
the records and memory

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of every chamber that is
below the region of Giza.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Amenti in the
language I remember,

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of the word, means
where all my knowledge is in.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So these halls of information
is where all the information

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:middle line:90%
of the planet was downloaded.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
It was ethereal place
connected to the physical one.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
They carved underground
so we could storage

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.340 align:middle line:90%
in water this information.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
They create these patterns to
bring the water from the river

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:84%
into the pyramids below
so all the Halls of Amenti

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:43.450 align:middle line:84%
will be the place where all
this vibration from Mannick web

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.270 align:middle line:84%
could be downloaded and
stored in the water.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:10%
The school teachings of
Djehuty and other people

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:10%
from that time were
are the schools

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.230 align:middle line:10%
that taught us that every
cycle of time we all

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:10%
needed to change.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:04.120 align:middle line:84%
That is why we needed to move
through the different levels

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
of vibration of the time
through the pyramids

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and to adapt into the
new times and new eras.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:84%
That is why at the moment
when the plan of building

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Amenti and building
the pyramids was trying

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to be designed by Djehuty,
we as Atlantean people

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
start to prepare ourselves for
the new time coming, the time

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of the rulers of the self, the
kings and queens of the spirit.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And that moment was, for
Atlantean people, the moment

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that they saw the clock of time
saying your time is ending.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone realized
about this ending of time,

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:84%
they went to what we call
now Egypt and created

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.640 align:middle line:84%
the libraries of Amenti
under the Giza Plateau

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:84%
so the new time could
protect that knowledge.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So this new time was protecting
the information underground.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So whatever happens
in the upper world,

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.380 align:middle line:84%
nothing would touch
the information below.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
During this process
of the Atlantean

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
beings that were
moving into Egypt

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
were trying to create this
new time, this new reality,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and this new humanity.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:84%
That was why at the end of the
time when Djehuty was starting

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to build the pyramids,
the Atlantean people

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.610 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't allow that
other colonies would

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:84%
split the information in a
different way they were doing.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.940 align:middle line:84%
In the Virgo Era, they were
thinking that everything

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:90%
was perfect as they settled.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't allow others to
change what they have created.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:10%
That made the Atlantean
people to create

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:10%
the civil war in which they
were trying to get power

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.370 align:middle line:10%
over all these other
civilizations being born

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.540 align:middle line:10%
to create this new time of Leo.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.240 align:middle line:10%
Because of the work and
dedication from Djehuty

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:10%
and so many of our ancient
Atlantean ancestors,

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:10%
the Halls of Amenti preserved
this cosmic information

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.940 align:middle line:10%
underground as the
growing Atlantean

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.380 align:middle line:10%
empire began to misuse their
power to control the planet.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But as with all
empires that focus

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
on power and control,
what rises must also fall.

guide, Matias de Stefano.

In the next episode, we
will uncover the network

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that was built by the empire and
how the misuse of that network

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:84%
created a global shift that
became one of the biggest

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:90%
legends in human history.
