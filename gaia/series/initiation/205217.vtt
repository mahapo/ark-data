00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.841 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the origin of
the gods and goddesses?

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.400 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
discuss the origin of God

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:10%
and ideas that helped create
the structure we have today.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
For us today, the idea of God
is something that we all already

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
kind of know what it means.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And even if we are
atheists or believers,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
we have this concept of God
incorporated in our bodies,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:90%
in our emotions, in our minds.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is because the
origin of everything,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
the origin of the
meaning of God,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
was, in English, the
origin of the word "good."

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Everything that is
good, everything

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.100 align:middle line:10%
that is fine for us, everything
that makes us feel complete,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:10%
full, that makes us feel that we
are getting into another level,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:10%
like going from the darkness
to the light, that represents

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:10%
the good things for us, so we
put those good things outside

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:10%
of us.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we created

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
through a structure that is more
biological than ideological.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
From the very beginning,
the idea of the good

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
was all the things that
create an idealistic path

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.670 align:middle line:84%
towards evolution, towards
our survival on earth,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and this comes from
the first cell that

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
needed to transform itself
through eating something

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:90%
that was good.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
This idea was to create
a biological system

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.680 align:middle line:84%
to transform within so we
could adapt to the outside.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And this idea in the
bottom of the oceans

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:90%
was to seek the light.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Once we have eaten
everything in the underseas

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:84%
when we were
unicellular beings, we

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:84%
needed to make photosynthesis
in order to have something

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.400 align:middle line:90%
to feed us to make us grow.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:90%
So this was the light.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And from the very beginning,
the first cell of our bodies

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
has this idea to reach
the light to be fulfilled.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So the seek of light in
history was more biological.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And the structure we have
of everything that is good

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
comes from what gives
us food, what gives us

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:90%
a good environment to survive.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And that is why when
the consciousness

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:10%
start to be aware of the
reality in this world.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:10%
When humanity realized about
the environment they were living

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:10%
in, they kind of understood
that the divine, the sun,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:10%
was helping the plants
to grow, was the weather

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:10%
that helped us to get the
food, was the solstice

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:10%
and equinox that
help to understand

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:10%
the movement of the
energy in the planet

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:10%
so we could know when to seed,
when to harvest, when to eat,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:10%
when to celebrate.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So this change of
weather, this change

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, the longest day,
the shortest day, the moon,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.360 align:middle line:84%
the sun created this idea
that the divine of nature

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
was giving us
something to survive.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So all good things came from
the light, from the moon.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
All these environmental
things has this energy

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that feeds us, that gives us
good things to be properly

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:90%
alive in this planet.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
started to put on that--

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:90%
the idea of the divine.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:10%
This was the biological way
in which we were connected

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.490 align:middle line:10%
to the concept of the divine.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:10%
And once we understood
that all these things that

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:10%
are good in the outside
are not good by itself

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:10%
but they are good because we
feel within that they are good,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:10%
the first thinkers of humanity
realized that everything

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:10%
that was good outside, it
was because our idea of them

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.880 align:middle line:10%
was good.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So that brought those
people to close their eyes

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and stop looking into
the sun and the light

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and begin to look and to
seek for the light within.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, they
realized that they were also

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
connected to the divine, that
they were part of that good,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and that the only way
to reach that good

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:90%
was to be connected to them.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:10%
In the origin of the universe,
the memory I have from that

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:10%
was that the divine was just a
consciousness and mind trying

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:10%
to understand itself.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So this consciousness start
to divide in many other parts

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
so it could see itself in
different perspectives.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And these main
vacuum, the void that

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
started to vibrate and create
all these other realities,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
recognized that, in every
single atom in the universe--

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:90%
he she it-- would be reflected.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:10%
So everything that
exists is divine.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And when we put a
consciousness to that,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
we realize that that divine
is the consciousness of good.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:10%
In that moment, when we
recognized that everything

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:10%
was the perspective shape, a
different reflection of just

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:10%
one only aspect of
the universe, then

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:10%
we realized that we
were not honoring

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:10%
the good things
outside, that we were

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:10%
honoring the shapes of this only
one being that connects us all.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:10%
From that moment, we recognized
that everything was connected

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:10%
through just one
energy, and that if we

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:10%
honor the shapes, each
one of those shapes,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:10%
we could be honoring the
reflections of ourselves

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:10%
through time and space.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
When people-- the first
humans, in doing that,

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:84%
recognized that they
had not the goal

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:90%
to survive but to transcend.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
That was the moment when other
beings from other dimensions

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and other planets came to
earth because this concept

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
of perspectives of
God was something

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that helped the beings
come into the planet

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
to teach the different
parts of this reality,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and to help humans to understand
that every part of the universe

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
was divided from the self, and
that if we could understand

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
each part of it, we
could reach the key

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to open the portals
to time, to space,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and we could become those
gods and goddesses in matter.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.555 align:middle line:10%
The main goal of
our civilizations

00:07:55.555 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:10%
in the first stage was
to try to understand

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:10%
how the universe worked
so we could understand

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:10%
the concepts of God and the
concepts of all the divine that

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:10%
was surrounding us.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:10%
From that moment, we knew that
every animal, every plant,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:10%
every mountain, rock, and every
human that was looking to us,

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:10%
he was God looking into us.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So we were observed by just
one only eye, and that idea

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of being seen from many
perspectives just from one only

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that was seeing everyone
in the same spot created

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the self,
created the idea

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.777 align:middle line:90%
of the sun being that I--

00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
our eyes being the reflections
to understand the consciousness

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.720 align:middle line:84%
of that I, and this
I was the center

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%
of three main concepts in
history, which was vibration,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:90%
energy, and matter.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
From that, we took the
will, the wisdom, and love.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
This concept with
the eye within would

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
create the shape
of this tetrahedron

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and the main concept
of what God is.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Even today in many churches,
we have this symbol

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
of this triangle
with an eye within,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
which was the main
code that we recognize

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:84%
in the past of this triangle,
creating a double cell, which

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
we call the vesica piscis,
creating this eye in the middle

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:90%
between this creation.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:10%
That would create the spirit,
the soul, and the body--

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:10%
the emotional way of seeing
the universe and the mind,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:10%
which was the first one
creating everything.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
From this idea, the Arcturian
people, Pleiadian people,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and, after that, the Sirian
people came to this world

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
to teach and give humans
the key to open those eyes--

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:90%
open your eyes within.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And to do so, we had three
different eyes in our body.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The first eye would
be the consciousness--

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
the first two cells
splitting in two,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
dividing and creating the shape
of an eye in the middle of two

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
cells that were held in
a triangle pointing north

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and another triangle
pointing south--

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.280 align:middle line:84%
That image would create the
concept of the third eye.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
The third eye would
be the pineal gland

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.730 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to connect
the two eyes in reality

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:90%
with the one inside.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So God was seen
through our eyes,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and that created the idea
that the universe was

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.840 align:middle line:84%
like the same eyes and
that everything surrounding

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the universe was a
wide space surrounded

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
by this geometry of
colors and galaxies all

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:84%
united by one point that
receive all lights, which

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is a black spot in the universe
from where everything came from

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and to where everything goes.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
This structure of God, the eye,
was the most accurate shape

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
to understand it.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:90%
But then we had the vibration.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
When we change this
position of the structure

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and we go down to the
throat, what we find

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
is the shape of the mouth.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So what we understood
about this new eye

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:84%
was that the second eye opening
in the universe to understand

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
God was the verb--

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:90%
the word.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
So universe saw
itself, saw everything

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that it was able to
create, and then say it.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
When he said it, the
first thing was the verb.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
was the vibration.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So God said this
understanding made

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
the Arcturian people
and Sirian people

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth to see that humans
have reached the idea of words.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:10%
When we as humans found out that
words were not only something

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:10%
to communicate but
also to transcend

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:10%
and transmit information--

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:10%
thoughts, dreams, concepts
that cannot be seen,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:10%
and emotions that
cannot be expressed--

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:10%
when we understood that, other
beings in other confederation

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.600 align:middle line:10%
realized that we
were able to connect

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:10%
with that voice of
the universe so we

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:10%
were able to create and
know for the first time

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:10%
the names of God.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And the other one was
dividing the cell into four,

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and what we will have is
another mouth and another shape

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
of an eye, but
this time vertical,

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that would create the
shape of the vagina.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The shape of the vagina
told us that the creation

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
of the universe was
the womb of the mother.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So the universe itself was a
womb watching and vibrating.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:10%
That's why for us in
the past, the universe

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:10%
was not something masculine.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:10%
It was feminine.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.635 align:middle line:10%
And everything in
our civilizations

00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:10%
were created through women
because we understood

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:10%
that women, the feminine
aspect of biology,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:10%
were the ones and the only ones
capable to bring the spirit

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:10%
to be born in matter.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
This channeling of the
information through these three

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
mouths or three
eyes were the ones

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
helping us to understand
the concepts of God.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we
had to understand

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that everything surrounding
us was God creating and seeing

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and vibrating.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:10%
In the first cultures that had
no connection with the people

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:10%
from the stars, they
understood that earth

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:10%
was talking to us
through vibration,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.310 align:middle line:10%
and they didn't see
these structures,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:10%
these realities outside,
like gods or goddesses.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:90%
They saw that as a divine--

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
as a part of the
divine that they

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.360 align:middle line:84%
could reach, that they could
touch, that they could feel.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:10%
So shamanism and
all other cultures

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:10%
connected to the nature, they
understood that there was not

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:10%
God, that there
were not many gods,

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:10%
that there was
only a connection--

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:10%
a vibration that was
expressed in every corner

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:10%
of the creation.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.300 align:middle line:84%
When we took that information
from the natural beings,

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.940 align:middle line:84%
the human natural beings, and we
added the sky way of thinking,

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the other cultures, other
civilizations, what we could do

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
was to name that energy
and put an order on it.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Sirius people taught
us as Atlanteans

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that the most important thing
that we could understand

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
was that the unity was
divided in vibrations.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we can say the
names of God, of the vibration,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
we would reach the perfect
amount of frequency

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
divine and information

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of the whole universe.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The first idea was if
we have three eyes,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:84%
these three eyes
has three purposes.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
The first one was
the inhalation.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The second one was
the contemplation.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And the third one
was the expression.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
This is this mind
breathing that inspire

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
itself, contemplates
everything that he, she, it

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
has done or can do.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And after that, just exhale.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
When it happens,
comes the creation.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So we said that the first
idea of God was breathing

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and that air and
mind were connected.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:10%
So as better we
breathe, the best

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:10%
we can reach the
idea and the mind

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:10%
and the clarity
to understand God.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:10%
That's why breathing
is the first key

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:10%
to understand the divine.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:84%
When we started to
understand this breathe,

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
we call this process
like the three H's,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:90%
which would be Ham, Het, Hum.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
These three H's--
these Ham, Het, Hum--

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.920 align:middle line:84%
would express the first
idea of what God is.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And the story that we had
was that in the beginning,

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:90%
the void start to breathe.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And when it breathed,
it start to dream--

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:90%
has three dreams.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The first dream was
the inspiration--

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:90%
the ideas.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The second dream was
to see everything

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
that he was able to do.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And the third dream
was realizing that he,

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:90%
she, it could do it.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.620 align:middle line:84%
So when it opened its
eyes and saw everything,

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the story says that
nine tears were dropped

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
through the universe,
and those nine tears

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
were the first
gods being created.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:10%
It was the nine
rays of light coming

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.780 align:middle line:10%
from the eyes and
nine vibrations that

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:10%
were creating everything.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Those nine tears
were called Wanim.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The Wanim were the first nine
dimensions, the singer ones--

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
those gods that were
singing the creation

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and nourishing the creation
with its white energy.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
The singers, the
Hathur or Wanim,

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that
started to create

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:84%
all the idea of what we call now
the divine gods and goddesses.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantean times, we
call those nine dimensions

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:10%
of reality with just
vowels because we

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.980 align:middle line:10%
said if everything
in the universe

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:10%
was created through vibration,
so the first idea of God

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:10%
would be the vibration that
creates us all through the nine

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:10%
dimensions.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:10%
So we would put nine names to
each one of those dimensions;

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:10%
[SANSKRIT LANGUAGE] and the
last one would be the breath.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:25.160 align:middle line:90%
[BREATHES]

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:10%
When we had these nine, we
could understand that the divine

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.210 align:middle line:10%
would have nine houses.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:84%
These nine houses would
be divided in three.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The ones of the spirit, Ham,
would be [SANSKRIT LANGUAGE]

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and will be the three
chakras above in our head.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Then the contemplation would
be the emotional step, Het,

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
with [SANSKRIT LANGUAGE] and the
three chakras within the body.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Then the last ones with
the creation of the matter

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:90%
would be Hum, the expression.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So the last three,
[SANSKRIT LANGUAGE]..

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:10%
These sounds are separated in
the nine houses of the divine,

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:10%
and these nine houses
would sound just

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:10%
with one vibration altogether
to say the name of God.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The vibration is
[UTTERS MANTRA],,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and what we name of it in
a short sentence would be

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:90%
[UTTERS MANTRA].

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.930 align:middle line:84%
The first vibration
after that would

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.930 align:middle line:84%
be the one that
makes the light start

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
to vibrate inside
your head, which would

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:90%
be the "em," the door letter.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:84%
[SHORT HUM] So that's
why we, in every culture,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
call the first name
of God like "Ohm."

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:10%
This concept of all the
divine in the nine houses

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:10%
would after divide in
the process of four.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those houses
would have four letters

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:10%
living in that house.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
This would be the process of
each one of those dimensions.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we have nine dimensions,
divided each one in four parts,

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:84%
we would have the
statements of the universe

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension,
which is time.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So if each one of the nine of
them has a process to take that

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
would create that
the letter "ah" would

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
have an expression,
an experimentation,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:84%
an integration, and a
transcendence to do.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and each one of them
would have a letter too.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So the first four letters
would be "em" and "na-ngya,"

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:84%
which is the first portal or
temple that every human have.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:10%
Then, like this, we will
go down to the whole body.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:10%
That gives us 36 letters--

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:13.330 align:middle line:10%
36 sounds that are
coming from these nine

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:10%
dimensions and these
nine sounds that we call

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:10%
the first gods on the creation.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:10%
But these 36 would have a
positive and a negative,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:10%
so we would find we'll have
36 negative and 36 positive

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:10%
giving us 72 vibrations.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Another way to understand
is that the nine dimensions

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
duplicate into other
nine dimensions.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:90%
That would give us 18 spheres.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
These 18 spheres,
connecting one to another

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:58.320 align:middle line:84%
into positive and negative,
will give us the flower of life.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.700 align:middle line:84%
This flower of life would
have imprinted inside of it

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
the codes of the
merkabah to tetrahedrons.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:10%
These tetrahedrons
within will activate

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:10%
in each one of its points
other three activations

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So what we will have now is
that these 18, nine positive

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and nine negative, will have
36 positive and 36 negative

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:90%
giving us 72 vibrations.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
These 72 vibrations
through time and space

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
will give us the
72 names of God.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
The 72 names of God in
the subtle realities,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.100 align:middle line:84%
in the dimensions over the sixth
dimension-- six, seven, eight,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and nine dimensions--
will give us

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
the realities in which
we were able to create.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:01.610 align:middle line:10%
So the gods would be 72 aspects
of just one divine trying

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:05.420 align:middle line:10%
to express the subtle world--

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:10%
the dimensions of the creation.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the 72
will duplicate itself

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
in the dimensions of
density, which would

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.520 align:middle line:90%
be five, four, three, two, one.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.520 align:middle line:84%
These other dimensions would
be the dimensions where

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.620 align:middle line:90%
the other 72 will be expressed.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So in density, we will
have another 72, giving us

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.230 align:middle line:90%
the number 144.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
The vibration 144,
it is the one that

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
connects every positive,
negative, dense, subtle

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
expression of the
flower of life,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and it has inside the seed, and
outside, it protects the tree.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So in the tree, every
world, every galaxy,

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:90%
every reality would be created.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So the first eye would
be now duplicated

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in thousands and thousands
of them, creating the Wanim

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and what we call
after that the Elohim.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim would be the
first structures or beings

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that represents the
gods and goddesses

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:90%
in the sixth dimension.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And from them,
all the structures

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that came to the
third dimension will

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
be divided in different
aspects of the God.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So for us, in our
planet, god and goddess

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
are the positive and
the negative expressions

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.090 align:middle line:90%
of the reality.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And every dimension
that was created--

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:90%
every vibration, every letter--

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:53.530 align:middle line:84%
these 36 consonants
with these nine vowels

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:58.960 align:middle line:84%
would be the keys, the tools to
create, to play, to understand

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:84%
how to build realities
through sound.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, for
us, in Atlantean times,

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
vibration sound
was the technology

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:84%
because we understood the power
to connect with the vibration

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:90%
144.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:84%
That number would bring
us to the consciousness

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and aware of God.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do that, we
have to honor every one of them.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
polytheism in the past

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:84%
was not something that
honor the different gods.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Polytheism was
something that helped

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:47.150 align:middle line:84%
us to focus in one and
each aspect of the divine

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:84%
so each one of us could
see through the eyes

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:90%
the sphere of God.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:10%
And they were not different
gods or different people.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:10%
They were just aspects
or people representing

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:10%
those concepts of God.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when we
reach the time to put them

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:84%
all together, the
enlightened ones,

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the ones who could
see the eye within,

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:84%
would bring the
message to remember us

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
that there is only one God.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's how monotheism
came to this world.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:84%
The only problem that
we had after that

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
was that we put that one
outside and not within where

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:90%
it was meant to be.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will dive deeper

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.750 align:middle line:84%
into the pantheon of gods
and goddesses of Egypt.

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:90%
