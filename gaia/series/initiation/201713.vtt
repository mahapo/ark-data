>> What started the war
between Atlantis and Mu?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.960 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
the major war between Atlantis

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:10%
and Mu and why Atlantis
became the ruling

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:10%
civilization of Earth.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
To understand why there was a
war between Atlantis and Mu,

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand the two
powers that rule the world

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and why they were
settled in this planet.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.100 align:middle line:10%
The first civilization than
was settled in in this planet

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:10%
to arise the power
of the civilizations

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:10%
was the Mu civilization.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:10%
They were called for by some
of the Atlanteans Alithir,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.510 align:middle line:10%
and they were the
angels of the sea.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:10%
And this was because they was
meant to be just in the ocean,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific Ocean,
trying to balance

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:10%
the information of the
whole planet through water.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to
settle in different regions

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Pacific Ocean, going
there through the porthole

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that the moon has left for them
billions and billions of years

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:84%
The energetical portal
through the moon and the water

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.940 align:middle line:84%
in this planet was
the main breach

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to bring those people
here to this world.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The rays of light,
the rays of energy

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
were the portals through where
they were able to descend

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and all of the
other species that

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
came to this planet used to
use these portals to arrive

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:90%
to this world.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So they created this idea
of the seven rays of light

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
coming from the skies and
downloaded this information

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:90%
in the planet.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why the rainbow
was one of the codes

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that they used to download the
information from the higher

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
levels of
consciousness, and they

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
knew that the
crystals in the water

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
showed this information
through the rain.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's why for them, the
rainbows were the books where

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
they could read all
information of the water,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and that is why humans
also related them

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
like the beings coming through
the portals of the rainbows

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:90%
to this planet.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
This idea created like a circle
of rainbows, circle of colors

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:90%
around the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So the main idea
why they were here

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.730 align:middle line:84%
was to calibrate the water,
the blood of the planet,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and to make it like
a library where

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
they could record everything
from the outer space.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:84%
The main structure
of civilization in Mu

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
was in between the islands of
New Zealand, Hawaii, and Easter

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Island, and they settled
four main portals

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
in North America and South
America, Australia and Asia.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:10%
And these four main portals
were the biggest deserts

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:10%
around the Pacific Ocean.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:10%
So these were the four
colonies that Alithir people

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:10%
had in order to keep the balance
and to keep the information

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:10%
from the ancient
water on the planet,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:10%
so these energies could be
downloaded through the desert

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:10%
to the whole Pacific Ocean.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:10%
And the four portals
were the protectors

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:10%
of these information.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
ones for the world

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.829 align:middle line:84%
were the ones taking
care of Nimo Pass.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Nimo Pass was what we
called now Indonesia.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
The Nimo Pass was a
connection of lands

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that connected Asia with
Australia at that time

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
when the Ice Age allowed a lot
of lands to be up of the sea

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and connecting these
two continents.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So the Nimo Pass was a territory
in South Indonesia that

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
had a tiny path of connection
to the Pacific Ocean

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:84%
by sea along the
north of Australia.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
In these islands,
in this region,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
what we call the Yomiom, it
was protected by the Alithir

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
that we know now with
the name of Lemurians.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurians tried to protect
the desert of Australia,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and the importance of the first
and very oldest humans that

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
were in the world,
the Australian people.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:84%
When Soffhir was the main
civilization around the planet,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
they were looking
for the humans that

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
could hold within the
knowledge of the mother.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
They would be the
ones able to create

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
new realities, to create
the perfect bond between sky

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and Earth.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So among all of the humans that
were being created by nature,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:84%
that were splitting from
Africa to Asia and Europe,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
the ones that were
the more important

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that
were very far from all

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:90%
the chaos of the continents.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
ones that accomplished

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
to get to Nimo Pass
that is Indonesia

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.420 align:middle line:90%
and settle in Australia.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The original people
from Australia,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
they were put there by
the Soffhir The Soffhir

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
taught them about the main
information from the sky,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and they were the ones trying
to create this humanity.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That is why they would say that
they are the snake people that

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
were created through the portal
of the snake from the sky.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
The main reason why this
island was so important

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
is because most of the
continent is a desert,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else can
touch that desert.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
The desert for the
snake people was

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important places
where you can find yourself.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Desert is the concept where
nothing can bother you

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and that you can just
focus in yourself.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
core of this desert

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is the big stone that represents
the core of the energy

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:90%
of the whole continent.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
structure of Australia

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
is the portal towards
the self can be released

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and where every information
can be attached to the planet.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:84%
This was the main island
that the Mu civilization

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
was trying to protect because
besides the Soffhir where

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the civilization that
tried to build this portal

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and tried to teach
the humans of that

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
portal how to use the energy
of sound, of creation,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and how to be related
with the planet,

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.530 align:middle line:84%
the Mu civilization
has also come here

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
to teach to humans how to
use the energy of the planet.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they understood
that the original people

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:90%
from Australia were--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.950 align:middle line:84%
since around 200,000 years
ago, were the first humans

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we are
part of the consciousness

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:84%
We thought that these
people had the seeds

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:84%
within to restore the
information of the planet

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:84%
when every civilization
would be lost.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's why for
Lemurian people,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Mu people, and Soffhir was
so important to protect them

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:90%
in this island.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
When the Aessir
came to this planet,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:84%
they ruled the deserts of
Middle East, Africa, and Europe,

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and they were opening
the portal of the stars,

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
so they could bring
their own information

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:90%
and rule their own world.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't able
to get the whole planet.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:84%
They were just in tiny
regions of the planet,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.430 align:middle line:84%
like Africa, Middle East,
and part of Asia and Europe.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
there was to split

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
the information of
the world in two,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
the ones coming from the air and
the ones coming from the water.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So Aessir were
related to the air

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
because they were related
to the information

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
of the ether, the
sky, the ones that

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:90%
came from other dimensions.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So they brought the ideas
of who humanity would be.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the Alithir
in the Pacific Ocean,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
they were just working with
the water, the vibration

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of this planet.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Aessir created humans
as we know them today

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
so they could transmit
their information,

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
their own information
from their own blood,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
from their own planets, so they
could transcend in this world

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and to survive in this world.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
use the biggest

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
portal of the
planet for the air,

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.300 align:middle line:84%
for the information
of the skies, which

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:90%
was the Middle East.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
While exactly the
opposite of it,

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
in the other side
of the planet, you

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle line:84%
have the main portal in
the Pacific Ocean, what we

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.440 align:middle line:90%
know today as French Polynesia.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:84%
This polarity of information
would allow the consciousness

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
of the planet to bring
two sides of information,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
the one negative and
the one positive,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:84%
one connected to the
water and the underworld,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and the other one
connected to the skies

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and the surface of the planet.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:10%
So when the Aessir
start to speak

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:10%
and creating these humans
for the first time in Middle

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:10%
East, what happened was that
the Confederation realized

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:10%
that humans were the most
prepared beings created

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:10%
in this planet that could
accept every information

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:10%
from the stars and also
being from this world.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:10%
So that's why they picked
these 12 families that

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:10%
were created in the Middle
East, and they brought them

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.910 align:middle line:10%
to the main core from where
the Kundalini energy started

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:10%
to flow towards the creation
of the consciousness.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
To understand this,
we have to remember

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
that Sirius people
came into this planet

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
to organize the Kundalini
energy of the planet,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
so they could bring a
civilization adapted

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to this world so they could
create consciousness alive

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that could create the machines
to open the portal through time

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
What they did was to create the
main portals between Antarctica

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and Greenland, and these main
portals from north to south

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
would be open through the
vertebrae of the planet that

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:84%
would start in Greenland
going down in Iceland, then

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to Azores, the Canary
Islands and going

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
through the Mediterranean
Sea to Turkey from there

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
to all the spine of the world
in all the mountains going

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
through Siberia, Alaska,
and then all America,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
to Patagonia and
Argentina and Chile.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And this energy that
was moving around

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:84%
was the flow of the natural
world, but in the unconscious.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
It was the snake trying to
rise the energy of the planet.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So they took that information,
that ability that this planet

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
has of moving the
flow of energy,

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and they structured
the civilization so we

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
as humans could follow
the pattern of energy

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
of this planet and
arise our consciousness,

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
our civilizations through
the spine of the planet,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.860 align:middle line:84%
so we could be related directly
with the core of the planet,

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
so we would become the
thoughts, the ideas

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:90%
in flesh of this world.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.480 align:middle line:84%
That is why the first settlement
was brought from the Middle

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:84%
East to south Greenland,
Iceland, Azores, and Canary

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Islands.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:10%
This region there
was the first stage

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:10%
where the Kundalini would be
downloaded from the North Pole

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:10%
towards the South Pole,
following all the connections

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:10%
of the mountains in the world.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:10%
According to the stories
of my grandfather

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.485 align:middle line:10%
from my life in Khem,
around 16000 BC,

00:13:30.485 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:10%
the 12 families began on Green
Cape, the island we call Khefu.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:10%
There were three main islands,
Ekaron, Khefu, and Evnoh.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:10%
At the height of then
Atlantean empire,

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:48.520 align:middle line:10%
there were around 300,000
people living in that region.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:10%
There were several villages
throughout the three

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:10%
main islands, but the
main capital of Atlantis

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.880 align:middle line:10%
was the circle city named
Khefis, located on Green Cape.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:10%
This was considered
to be the origin

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:10%
and the center of Khefislion,
the Atlantean empire.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
When Atlantis
civilization, the Khef,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
started to be split in those
islands into 12 families,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:84%
they realized that
they had this purpose

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
of creating a new civilization
that could rule the world, that

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
could be better than their
fathers and mothers, Aessir,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.390 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So what they decided was
we need to conquer them.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
We need to go and
take over them,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
so that would
allow them to reach

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:90%
the power of the whole planet.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturian people
taught the Atlantean people

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
that the power of the
world was consciousness,

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that the power of the world
was to become the planet.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do
that, we needed

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
to reach every
portal of the planet

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
to have the thinkings of
the planet in ourselves.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:84%
So if the 12
families of Atlantis

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:84%
would be split in the world
in the 12 phases of the world,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
we could download information
from the Atlantis perspective

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and create the first idea of
who we are as planet Earth.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what pushed
them to go out

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the islands of the
Atlantean Ocean,

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
following the pattern
of the energy flowing

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
and they first went

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to the crossing energy
of these Kundalini

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.330 align:middle line:90%
between Morocco and Spain.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So this Atlantean
civilization started

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to make some settlements in
the Mediterranean Sea following

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
this fracture of the energy
coming from the Atlantic Ocean.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
This separation
of the continents

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
between Africa and
Europe was the pattern

00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that they follow to reach
the head of the snake.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
From that following
of the energy,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
they sell their
phase settlements

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
in all the region
of Middle East,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.450 align:middle line:84%
from Egypt to Anatolia
and all this region

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:19.580 align:middle line:84%
that now we call Jordan, Israel,
Lebanon, Syria, Arabia, Iraq,

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Iran.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:25.970 align:middle line:84%
All this region was
took by the Atlanteans,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
but they followed the energy
flowing through the mountains

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.240 align:middle line:90%
more east and east.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So that took them to the portal
of Pakistan, Afghanistan,

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:84%
India, and they reached the
high mountains in the Himalayas.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
When they arrived there, the
Yomiom, the Lemurian ones,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
they just went
straight to the doors

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:84%
of the portal in the
Himalayan mountains,

00:16:54.770 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and they settle this army to
protect the portals of the Mu

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.690 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
What they knew at that time was
that if Atlantean people would

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
reach the whole
pattern of the snake,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.460 align:middle line:84%
they would be surrounding
the Mu portal.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So all the information of the
water would be now a pattern

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:90%
held by the Atlantean people.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So that meant the ending
of the Mu civilization.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Mu people would never
fight against anyone.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.910 align:middle line:84%
They would be like
angels in the seas.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
confederation just told them

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:90%
it is time for you to leave.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all
this civilization just

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
left the cities,
left the portals,

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and peacefully, they just
went away to the underground,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:84%
and they left the only
colony trying to fight

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:90%
for them that was the Yomiom.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.620 align:middle line:84%
This region tried to fight
against the Atlanteans,

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't reach
the whole planet,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the whole world.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But it was something natural
that that had to happen.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans had to go and
follow the pattern of the snake

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and to rule the whole
planet and every portal.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why
they were chosen

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
to fight the energy of Atlantis,
it was because of polarity.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.360 align:middle line:84%
This polarity means that
they were the ones taking

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
care of the Australian
portal of the world,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:84%
so they were in the
desert of Australia

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and exactly in the opposite
side of the planet,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:90%
we have North Atlantic Ocean.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So they were against
each other by magnetism,

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:90%
by idea, by polarity.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:84%
They were precisely
the two civilizations

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that were exactly against
each other geographically.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So that is why they
kind of knew that they

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
had to fight each other
in order to see who

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:90%
would rule the world right now.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
In other dimensions,
this war was not

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:84%
something seen
like something bad.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a creation
of a new humanity,

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of something
new for our third dimensional

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.100 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
From the fifth and
the sixth dimension,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.670 align:middle line:84%
polarity creates
chaos and creation,

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and that is why they choose
this polarity of this Yomiom

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:84%
civilization and the
Khefian civilization

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to reach the middle
point in between of them

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in India, Pakistan,
and when they

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
got in touch in the middle
point of connection,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:84%
what they did was to transform
themselves in other things.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:90%
They start the war.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
This war would be like different
groups of energies reaching

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:84%
the same spot of one
of the main portals,

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and this would create the
chaos for the first time

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.430 align:middle line:84%
in this planet in between
the two civilizations that

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:84%
would rule the
world and that would

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
lead the ideas of the world for
the next thousands of years.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
The way the war was
held in that time

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
was not through the
technology of light

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
or the technology of
guns, like we know today.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we had different
ways of understanding

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
how a war was held because
we had the sound technology.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The sound technology
was to use the vibration

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
of the whole planet
to create realities,

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:90%
but also to destroy realities.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:10%
We call this technology
as protiktah.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Protiktah was the
structure of 33 cubes that

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.040 align:middle line:10%
created this interdimensional
and three dimensional chakana,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.200 align:middle line:10%
which is this
shape of the symbol

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:10%
that we had in South
America, in Bolivia and Peru,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.830 align:middle line:10%
but when you split it
in different structures,

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.010 align:middle line:10%
in different cubes, you
would have the system

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:10%
that they used to create
the pyramids to create

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:10%
the technology of vibration.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
They used to put water
inside and encode this water

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
by vibration, so everything
that was exactly the same

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:84%
would reproduce the same
amount of energy and vibration

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
by quantics along
the whole planet.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So every pyramid, every
temple, every stone circle

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that has the shape
of this structure

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
would replicate the same
amount of energy and vibration,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
so everyone could
reach the information

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:90%
that they were searching.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It was like the first
Wi-Fi, the first internet

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:90%
that we had in our planet.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So this structure that was
being created around the planet

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
by the Atlantean
people was something

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
that allowed them to light
the cities that they would

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.340 align:middle line:84%
use to heal, that they would
use to contact other times

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
and spaces, that they would
use to build pyramids,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:84%
to build structures
to regenerate

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
the cells in your body to live
longer than we live today.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So all this technology
that was used

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
for the aware of the
consciousness and to make it

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
higher in frequency, so every
planet could listen this world,

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and we could listen every
planet in the confederation

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:90%
was also used for this war.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
the first mistakes

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantean
civilizations did.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
They organized this structure
of connection in the world,

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
creating these sound
vibrations, and they structured

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
these pillars of
resonance they were

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
created in different
parts of the world.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So when they would create
a huge amount of energy

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
by vibration in one
pyramid, this vibration

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
would be transmitted to
different spots of the planet,

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:90%
like cables, like a network.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So in a tiny amount of
vibration, they could heal,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.080 align:middle line:84%
they could change the patterns
of the DNA, they could build.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you put all this amount
of vibration in just one spot,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the whole network looking into
one spot, what you would have

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
is the same amount of energy
that we call now atomic bomb.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:10%
So it was not only a
war fought by soldiers

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:10%
fighting with swords, the
main war was through sound.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:84%
This energy was used
against the Lemurian people

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
so they could have the
power of the portals.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:84%
In this war, they brought
the Lemurian people

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:84%
close by the temples,
and the moment

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
they were all close, the
temples and the pyramids,

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
they would put all information,
all the energy of the pyramids

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
towards that only pyramid.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
that, we could see

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:84%
this energy like a big sound
wave with a lot of energy.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
All this energy
was moving around,

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and you could see like a light,
and when it was expanding,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
everything that touches
just became like dust.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Every living being
in kilometers around,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
plants, animals,
stones, and people

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:84%
that were living in those
regions, even the cities that

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
were in those regions
were turned into dust.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
Atlantean people show

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
their power of using
the energy of sound

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:90%
around the whole world.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is how they won the
war against the Lemurian people.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Nobody in the world would now
fight against the Atlantean

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:10%
people because they
show the power of sound.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:35.110 align:middle line:84%
They show that this amount of
energy was now in their hands.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
This energy that is known
now by some biblical stories,

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
like Sodom and Gomorrah
and the destruction

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of the cities in the Middle
East by vibration, by sound,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
by these lights that turn
everything into dust,

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and the last tiny part
of this energy that

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:84%
was brought to the regions
of the Ganga in South Egypt,

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
now called Ethiopia,
was what in the Bible

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
they call the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:12.370 align:middle line:10%
They took this part of
the protiktah energy that

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:10%
was used to enlighten
the power of the pyramids

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:10%
around the world, so it
was the last tiny part

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.980 align:middle line:10%
that they could keep before
the last fall of Atlantis

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:10%
destroyed all the system
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
That is why today
we can't remember

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:84%
that the most powerful
energy in history

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
was that energy that made
that every atom by vibration

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.410 align:middle line:90%
become dust.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the reasons
why after the Atlantis wars

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
with Lemuria and before the fall
of Atlantis, many of the cities

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and many of the main
places of this civilization

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
just disappeared and just killed
around 80% of the population

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of our civilizations.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So many of the pyramids
that were around the world,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and even in the
Pacific Ocean, they

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:90%
were nothing after this war.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We only have from them
the main structures,

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
like the basements or some
structures from the floor.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot have now
the main structures

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
because of the destruction
through vibration and also

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.650 align:middle line:84%
because of the time and the
climate change and volcanoes.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But mainly during the big
war, when they disappear,

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:43.010 align:middle line:84%
they are under water
or under Earth.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:84%
This war was in the blood and
the memory of every culture

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
in history of
humanity, so that would

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.660 align:middle line:84%
mean that every human,
even today, has the memory

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:90%
of that war within us.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.940 align:middle line:84%
We have this memory of two big
civilizations fighting, taking

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
care one of them the West
and the other one the East,

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and that would separate the
idea of the world between East

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and West, and that would be the
first idea of the whole world

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.115 align:middle line:84%
separated and fighting
in different ideas.

00:28:19.115 --> 00:28:21.810 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So this war around
15,000 years BC

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:84%
was the war that allowed
the Atlantean people

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
to reach the Taklamakan
Desert and to build

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids that we
know today in China

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:90%
and all the regions in Asia.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So they were downloading the
information of the Kundalini

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.600 align:middle line:84%
through Asia and
going to America.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
This was the beginning of the
rise of the Atlantean empire

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.310 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:01.292 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
With a deeper understanding of
the origins of the Atlantis,

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the initiative path continues
as we discover how the Atlantean

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
empire paved the way for humans
to become gods and goddesses.
