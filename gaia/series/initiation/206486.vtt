00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are the sixth
dimensional architects?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And how do they
create realities?

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:10%
In this episode,
we will explore how

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:10%
the architects create
life experiences

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.090 align:middle line:10%
in the third dimension.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
The last 2,000 years has
been difficult to understand

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:90%
why we are here in this planet.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.160 align:middle line:84%
We had these different
ideas of how we came here.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a culture that was
created through the main idea

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
that we were separated in
between heaven and Earth.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So for us in the last 2,000
years, Earth was like a prison

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
from where we need to escape
from and to go back to heavens.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And we created the ideas of
the universe exactly the same

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:84%
as we were living
here in this planet.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we create
a king in the skies--

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
God-- and also an
enemy from which we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
the population have
to be protected from.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But this perspective
of darkness has

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:90%
only no more than 3,000 years.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually for all the
ancient cultures,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:84%
darkness was just the
other side of light.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And both of them were
needed to create realities.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
We were living in this world
because of both of them,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
because they were treated
like the forces of nature

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:90%
and the forces of heaven.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
The two of them were
like husband and wife.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying
to raise their kids

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
in two different ways
but in the same family.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:90%
The wife was Earth.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So every shape
that our world has,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
from every animal, every
plant, every mineral

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
from the underground was
related to the mother because

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:90%
of the womb in the Earth.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So that is why all the shapes
of these creatures that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
created the reality,
that feed us with energy

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:90%
were all related to this mother.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the
last 2,000 years, when

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.950 align:middle line:84%
we became monotheistic
religions and started

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.610 align:middle line:84%
to see only the path
of God through the Son,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.960 align:middle line:84%
we started to believe that
everything that was on Earth

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
was bad, that everything that
was related to the mother,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:90%
to the womb, was bad.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And we created this idea that
all these animals and plants

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that first were related to
the mother, to the creator,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
now are the shapes from
what we have to escape from.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So that is why we created
this image of a demon

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.430 align:middle line:84%
with horns, with big
eyes, with animal shapes.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So everyone could
realize that if you

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
find any of those symbols,
it would be bad for you.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And until today, we
have these images

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
that were created
just 2,000 years ago

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that shape the idea of
this creator of evil.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And for the universe, this
is not really like that.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:90%
This is just human history.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And it is mostly
a history related

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
with Middle East, Europe, and
some parts of Africa and Asia.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
For other regions of the
planet, the bad ones,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
the evil was not written
like a bad thing.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
They were treated like
the creators of realities.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is more related as
how the universe understands

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:90%
the process of Lucifer.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer, which means the
"beautiful light," [LATIN],,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.959 align:middle line:84%
it was the name in
Latin with which

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
we knew this big archangel
that tried to build itself

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
through other perspectives,
not by expansion

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.530 align:middle line:90%
but by contraction.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
This was the son
of the universe,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:90%
that its own body was all light.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
But because of
being that light, he

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
was kind of bored
that he only could see

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:90%
one perspective of everything.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to transform
himself into the opposite

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
so he could play with
different tones of light.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
The story says that he
was against his father.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
His Father, God, the
universe, told to him

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that he had to find
the path of light

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
because he was the
most beautiful light.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But his question was,
if I am the light,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to seek it?

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The only way I can seek
the light if I am the light

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
is if I hide it, if I
put different colors

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
so I can mistake the light and
I can figure out how to find it.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is how the main
light of the universe

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
started to bend
itself in energies.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
What we call
"light", the process

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of light in the universe,
is what we call now energy.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Energy is the flow of
all the waves of time

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.410 align:middle line:90%
moving through the space.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And these waves of energy
connects everything

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
in different levels
of vibration.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
These different levels
of vibration of light

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.780 align:middle line:84%
creates for the first
time what we call colors.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And the colors create the idea
of what we name today souls.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
All the patterns of
souls are the ideas

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and the main structures of the
registry of every experience

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So the main light
fractalizes itself

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
in thousands of colors
coming from the main 12

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:90%
colors of the rainbow.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
These 12 that we have in
this spectrum of colors

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
would create so much
energy in a high vibration

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and a low vibration, what
we call cold and hot,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And these waves of
energy would create

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:90%
different types of distortion.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:84%
This was the main
project of Lucifer,

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
creating distortion in reality.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So that created what we call
now the sixth dimension.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension was
the different vibrations

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that were
allowed to create realities

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:90%
from those distortions.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you are
creating so many distortions

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
from the first light that
you can see these reflections

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:90%
like in mirrors.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And every mirror will
see a different shape.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And from those shapes, you would
be able to build realities.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that these first
structures that were created

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
were the main
geometry that we know,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
the tetrahedron, cube,
octahedron, icosahedron,

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and dodecahedron.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And after that, you
put them all together,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:84%
creating the sixth
one that creates

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
the six spheres of creation
in the sixth dimension.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So they are like the bricks
to build this building, which

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.020 align:middle line:90%
is reality.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The main structures
of the universe,

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
the main bricks to
create everything,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
were the product created
through the distortion

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
of this light that was bending
itself in different shapes.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:10%
So that's how Lucifer started
to create the main structures

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:10%
for the universe to
create new realities.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And its main goal was
allowing the self, the spirit,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
to split in many spirits.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So the spirits could
split in many souls.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And the souls could
split in many lives

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:84%
so the lives could split
in many experiences,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000 align:middle line:84%
like a tree that,
with all its branches

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
and flowers and
leaves, could show you

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
through the fractalization
how we could achieve more

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
light if we have thousands
of flowers and thousands

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of leaves instead of having just
one flower or just one leaf.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.840 align:middle line:90%
That was the main idea--

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.940 align:middle line:84%
reproducing ourselves
from the same shape

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
so we could have different
perspectives of ourselves

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and different paths
towards the light.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
These different paths
were the product

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and the main job of the
architects of the universe.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
The architects of the
universe were the archangels.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
They came from the
aspects of the universe

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in the seventh dimension.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And they started to
become themselves,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:84%
the vibration in these different
shapes, the bricks of reality.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
When they came from
the seventh dimension

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
to the sixth dimension,
they become polar.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.830 align:middle line:90%
They start to be polarity.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, from
those six main structures,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.010 align:middle line:84%
they created the 12
structures from them.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
These 12 structures would
be other perspectives

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of these first five
bricks of creation.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And what you will have now
would be all the main structures

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:90%
for atomic reactions.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The bigger you are
in the universe,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
you are not going to see
galaxies or clusters or suns.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
The bigger you are
in the universe,

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.150 align:middle line:84%
the only thing you
can possibly see

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is the main structures
in the atomic level.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
we can understand

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:84%
that the sixth dimension is not
building realities from above.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They are building
realities from within.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
The main structures that were
created in the sixth dimension

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
are the ones called now
the five Platonic solids.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:10%
And from them, the
expressions of these five

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:10%
are the 12 phases
and the 12 structures

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:10%
created by the
archangels, the self

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:10%
body of the
archangels, what we now

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:10%
call the Archimedian solids,
the Archimedian structures.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:10%
That's why the beings
in the sixth dimension

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:10%
have to become those shapes
and transform in those shapes,

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.340 align:middle line:10%
so they could show how
to build these realities.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So the first 12 main structures
of the universe, the geometry

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
or solids of Archimedes, they
are the main 12 structures

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
from which you could see every
atom organizing the structures

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
of every reality.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So there is no bigger
beings in the universe.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There are smaller beings
that reproduce itself

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
in so many levels that
we can have the space.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
That is how the sixth dimension
creates the third dimension

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:90%
through the holograms.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
The holograms are
just one reality,

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
which are these 12 bricks coming
from the five central ones.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And from them, they just
play with each other.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:90%
They just use it like a LEGO.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And they start to
replicate these shapes

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
in different levels, projecting
the ideas into matter.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Projecting the
ideas into matter is

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to bring the ether into the four
pillars, which are Earth, fire,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:90%
water, and air.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Ancient people used
to say that we were

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:90%
built by these five elements.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's not because we
were built by the element.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:10%
But we were built by
the structures that

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:10%
allows those elements to exist,
with all the atomic reactions

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.550 align:middle line:10%
that happen in the tiny universe
where the sixth dimension is

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:10%
happening.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So what Lucifer did
with the sixth dimension

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
was to allow all the beings
that were being created there

00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to shape themselves
into the positive ones

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and the negative ones.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The positive ones would
be the ones leading

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:90%
the ideas of the creation.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And the negative ones would
be those creating those ideas

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and transforming
themselves in those ideas.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the idea that we have
today of angels and demons.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
For the universe, there
is no angels and demons.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:10%
There are positive aspects
of the universe that are

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:10%
divided into the core of light.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are different aspects
in the darkness spectrum

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
creating the scenario.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:84%
All the backstage of this
theater, which is reality,

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:90%
is created by the demons.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Demons are shapes, are geometry
from the very tiny universe

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
that are projecting the ideas
of the light into the matter.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
That is how, in the
sixth dimension,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
some physical beings can be
related to the ethereal ones.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The ethereal ones are
those like the angels that

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.090 align:middle line:84%
reflect the lights
and its colors

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and the purpose
of every creation.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:10%
And the darkest
ones, the demons,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:10%
are those who distort
the light of the angels

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:10%
so the angels could
experience its own realities

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:10%
and its own dreams.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the sixth dimension
and the fifth dimension,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
there is no battle
between angels and demons.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:90%
They work together.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
All the plan of the
creation between the light

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and the darkness was
to create the shapes

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension,
in the atomic reactions

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in the tiny universe so the
main source of the universe,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:84%
which is the spirit, could
be divided in thousands.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And from the main
trunk in the tree,

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
they could be split in different
arms, in different branches,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
so they could see different
perspectives from the leaves,

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.550 align:middle line:84%
from the flowers, and
then create fruits

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that would feed
the seeds in order

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
to create a new universe that
we would call a new tree.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So that created the shape
of the tree of life.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life, the geometry,
and the spectrum of expansion

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
of the universe was decided
in the sixth dimension

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
by angels and demons.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.140 align:middle line:84%
They were the main cells of
the body of the archangels.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Archangels were these big bodies
trying to transform themselves

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
from these main structures,
the 12 structures

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:84%
that Plato and Archimedes
tried to settle

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
so we could understand
the basis of the universe.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So from those shapes, what the
spirit could do was to divide;

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to reflect and
suddenly find itself

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:84%
into these billions of
shapes of evolution.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Evolution was a system designed
by Lucifer so the spirit could

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
improve itself.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:90%
But we have to think this.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer and the archangels
were not something different

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:90%
They were the system.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:90%
They are the system.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not a being with eyes,
with hands creating stuff.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
They are the system
itself trying to duplicate

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%
in thousands of fractals.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:90%
So they are creating us.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So we are a hologram
that was created

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:90%
from the sixth dimension.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And we are part of the
body of those beings.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This allows the spirits to
go through time and space

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%
and to leave every reality.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
This allows the
God to see, feel,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:84%
be connected to every reality
that we from this Earth

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
see separated with
different orders.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But they are not really
orders of structure.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
They are just a flow of energy
that is transforming itself.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
From our dimension,
the third dimension,

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
we are connected to
the sixth dimension

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
because we are meant to be the
creators of our own reality.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
As I said some time
before, the 3, 6, and 9

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
are the path that we have
taken to the God, "God" meaning

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.390 align:middle line:90%
the ninth dimension.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And three dimensions less,
we have the sixth dimension,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:84%
which is the creator
of the shapes

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:90%
from the ninth dimension.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:10%
And the third dimension
is the experimentation

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.820 align:middle line:10%
of these patterns in
the sixth dimension.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So that is why it's easier
for us in the third dimension

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to be related with the
sixth dimension than beings

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
even in the fifth dimension
relating to the sixth one.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.820 align:middle line:10%
The first dimension,
the fifth dimension,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:10%
and the seventh
dimension are connected.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
The second, the fourth, and
the eighth are connected.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And the third, sixth,
and ninth are connected.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:10%
So that is why the beings
in the fifth dimension

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:10%
need to create paths
through the third dimension

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.270 align:middle line:10%
in order to create realities.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is why beings
like Pleiadian people that

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
are really in high vibration,
to get into the sixth dimension,

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
need us in the third
dimension to get

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
to the core of the realities.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:84%
This explains why
so high level beings

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
are seen into us that they
are trying to contact humans,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
beings in the third
dimension, because we

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:84%
are the path through
where they can reach

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:90%
the creation of realities.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:84%
We could say, why
are they using us?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And why can they be
harvesting energy

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
to reach the sixth
dimension through us

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:90%
if we have free will?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you are in
the third dimension,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:84%
you are bounded by every
pattern you have thought about,

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
you have created.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's not someone
creating your own reality.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
It's yourself creating
realities so you can live them.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Free will is not exactly as
we have thought it to be.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not just our ability to
choose our destiny in our life

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and what we are willing to do.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But what really free
will is talking about

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is our ability to
create our own life.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you are someone
that is writing a story

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
to make a movie.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you wrote
the story and you

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
have the whole idea of what you
want to tell about this story.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
make the costumes.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to see who is going

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to build all the backstage, who
is going to build everything

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:90%
so it would seem real.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to learn
your own character.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to build the character,
which is your personality.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you need
to learn how to act.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And once you are on the play,
once you are being filmed,

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:90%
you stop being yourself.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:90%
You become the character.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot do whatever you
want when you are filming it

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise the
story won't make sense.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:10%
And that is why you don't have
free will, because you already

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:10%
decided to live what
you have written.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, from the
fifth dimension, the ones that

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
are seeing all the
scripts of the movie,

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.590 align:middle line:84%
they can change
some words in order

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:90%
for it to make more sense.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is the holograms from
the fifth dimension helping

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
us to evolve and be
aware of our evolution.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of beings in
the third dimension

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:84%
are able to understand
how this works.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
These beings were humans
that were so in touch

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
with the mother,
with nature, that

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
were the creators, the
elemental beings, the fairies,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:90%
the gnomes.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Every being that was
coming from the darkness

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that we see with colors,
the creators of our nature,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.930 align:middle line:84%
they could speak to them
so they could understand

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:90%
how to transform realities.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Those are the alchemists.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
In history we call them
the druids, the physicians,

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:84%
the architects, the
alchemists of history.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have a few of
them in every culture.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
The shamans for North America
and Siberia and South America,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
they all can understand
how reality works.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And they can transform
these realities.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
They can open these portals
to create new realities

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
from nothing from
the sixth dimension

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.845 align:middle line:84%
by using the ether that connects
us all to create patterns

00:22:05.845 --> 00:22:06.645 align:middle line:90%
in the outside.

00:22:06.645 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.850 align:middle line:84%
It's important for
us to understand

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
how we can be related to the
sixth dimension because we

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.810 align:middle line:84%
as humans believe that we are
the lowest part of the society

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:90%
in the divine realm.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
We believe that
we are the workers

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and that we need this connection
with the enlightened ones,

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
with the masters,
with the angels

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to reach God, like if God
is a king of this realm.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:90%
So we are there.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we have,
pushing our process

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
to the underground, all the
demons, all the creatures,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.550 align:middle line:84%
all the dark archangels until
we reach what we call Lucifer.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:90%
So we have this polarity.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize that
this is not like a kingdom.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:90%
This is not like humans.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:84%
This is polarity, which is the
main structure that creates

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:90%
atoms, that creates realities.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So we are bounded
by both of them.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And we are in the middle.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So we, in the third
dimension, are the ones

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that are able to
reach and contact

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the darkness and the light and
use it to create new realities.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.970 align:middle line:10%
And that is why in
the fifth dimension,

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:10%
in the fourth dimension,
they all, in every species

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:10%
and every race that exists
in different planets,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:10%
are looking into our
process of evolution

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:10%
because what we
do now can change

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:10%
the realities in
the sixth dimension,

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:10%
creating new seeds
and new universes,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:10%
so new realities that can help
the universe to understand

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.970 align:middle line:10%
itself in different ways.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So that is why it's important
for us in the third dimension

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:84%
to understand our relationship
with the sixth dimension,

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.100 align:middle line:84%
because we are more
related to the darkness,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:90%
to the backstage of this movie.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones able to
create our own realities.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:84%
We are the product of
our own architects.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So for us it's important, the
relation and understanding

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:22.050 align:middle line:84%
of the sixth dimension, because
we are the ones here testing

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.370 align:middle line:84%
our own realities, our own
thoughts, our own creation.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
We are here enjoying
what we have created.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's our responsibility
and it's also

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:84%
a joy to understand that
everything that is created

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:90%
is created by us.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we reach
the sixth dimension,

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
we would be able to be the
builders of our own reality.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.022 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.022 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide Matias de Stefano.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
how patterns are
designed and created

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to allow the
evolution of species.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:90%
