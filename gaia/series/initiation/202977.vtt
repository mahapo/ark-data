00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was 12 years old, my
guides told me in seven days,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I would start to
remember other lives.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.840 align:middle line:84%
The first memory I
had, I was living

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:90%
in a major colony named Khem.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Around 2,000 years after
the Atlantean empire

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.590 align:middle line:90%
began crumbling.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
This colony was
built around a plan

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:10%
we called Ater Tumti, which
means bring heaven on Earth.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.190 align:middle line:84%
The main goal of
Khem was to create

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
a society built around an
ancient path along the Nile

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:90%
River.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:10%
My name was Shiw.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And I completed the
initiative path.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing the most
intense challenges

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:90%
to test every cell of my body.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
A series of 33 tests
to transcend the limits

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:90%
of the third dimension.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
This test was to prepare
you to become a key

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to open and raise the harmonic
frequency of the planet Earth.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
To becoming an Idilien,
which means those

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.690 align:middle line:10%
who are the elements of nature.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
In this season, we
will dive deeper

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:90%
into Atlantean technology.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Discover the origins of
the gods and goddesses

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:90%
from ancient Egypt.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Follow the path of initiation
through my memories of it.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And reveal how Khem
became one of the mother

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:10%
civilizations of the planet.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.
