00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.945 align:middle line:10%
>> Which species had the most
influence on human design?

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:26.450 align:middle line:10%


00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will uncover
how the leap in human evolution

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:10%
created a vehicle for humans to
transcend the third dimension.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The design of every species was
held by the sixth dimension.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So us, in other
dimensions, we designed

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
the patterns and the
purposes of every species,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
every race in every world,
every planet, every system.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So those patterns
and those structures

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
were already settled for
everyone in every reality.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.235 align:middle line:84%
So what we could do with
that in the fourth dimension

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and the third dimension was just
to play with those tools that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
were given to us,
so we could try

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to improve our own genetics,
our own way of being.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:10%
So for other beings
and other planets,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:10%
what they started to do was
to reach for those planets

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:10%
where the evolution and
the patterns of creation

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:10%
were able to adapt to their
own patterns of creation.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
main characteristics

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
of the species being born from
water, Earth, fire, and air.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:10%
Those beings were, in
the normal evolution

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:10%
for every planet
and here on Earth,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:10%
they were the perfect design to
make improvement and evolution

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:10%
for a natural order.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:10%
There was no alien and
no Confederation involved

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:10%
in the creation of
the species on Earth.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It was just Earth
trying to evolve itself

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
in different ways, in
different patterns,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
using the main tools that the
sixth dimension gave to us.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So from there, it was just
improvement after improvement

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:84%
through the patterns of
evolution in this planet.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.720 align:middle line:84%
But they knew that
this planet, Earth, was

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:90%
in the process of awakening.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So through millions
of years, they

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
started to reach this
planet, to watch this planet,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to see how was the
evolution of this planet.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So they tried many
times to create

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
a civilization in
this planet, not only

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
from one million years ago but
also from before the dinosaurs.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We had many tries to
create civilizations

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
in different times
of our history,

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
before dinosaurs, with the
dinosaurs, after the dinosaurs.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying to see what
the planet was trying to reach.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things that made us

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
know that humans
were the chosen ones

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
was because we
started to use words.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Humans took a different
path in geometry

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:84%
that was not exactly the
same like other beings

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They started to recognize
themselves as a being.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:84%
They could recognize themselves
and think about themselves

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and saying for the first time or
kind of say for the first time,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:10%
This moment in which
I introduce myself

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:10%
to another being with my
hands, with my movements,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:10%
with my eyes, with
my language, sounds

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:10%
was the moment where not only
tetrahedron cube, icosahedron,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:10%
and dodecahedron
were working on us

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.720 align:middle line:10%
but also was activated
the octahedron.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:10%
When the essence
was activated on us

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:10%
and the natural
order of the planet

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:10%
was trying to evolve
into consciousness,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:10%
the other planets
in the Confederation

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:10%
started to feel that
vibration, that there was

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:10%
a species recognizing itself.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
We can understand
this like if we

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.090 align:middle line:84%
could imagine that the whole
galaxy is like a big spider

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:90%
web.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:10%
And there are some species
that are like spiders

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:10%
in different planets.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
those spiders, they

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
are still in their
planets, waiting

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:84%
for the waves of vibration
and time to be felt by them.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So they could see and
reach, by vibration,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
where there is something new
vibrating in the same level

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:90%
That's how the network works.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
They just, being in
their own planets,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:84%
start to feel that
something is changing

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
in the purpose of the
network, that something new

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:90%
is vibrating.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:84%
For some planets that
are those spiders,

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
they felt like we are
new spiders in evolution.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And for other planets,
we were like a fly.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:10%
And every aware
being in the galaxy

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:10%
knows that when they feel
this vibration that resonates

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:10%
with them, it's because not
only a species is becoming aware

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:10%
but the planet is
becoming aware.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was the main key
that told us that Earth

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:90%
was thinking about who she is.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.000 align:middle line:84%
She stopped to evolve normally
through the four elements

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly awakes the fifth
element that united them all,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
that is the awareness of itself.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
This vibration resonates
in the whole universe,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
in the whole galaxy, and every
planet that is aware of itself

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:84%
tries to reach that information
and to seek that information.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And the most similar vibration
between Earth hominids

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and the galaxy that we
share was in Arcturus.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Arcturian
people realize

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that this planet was able to
handle their own vibration

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and their own patterns.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:10%
This is how the
Arcturians started

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:10%
to codify these
patterns of geometry

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:10%
that they have into
the idea of putting

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:10%
those patterns in those
hominids in that new planet

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:10%
so we could develop
our consciousness.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But it was not because they
were interested in humans.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:10%
They were interested
in speaking with Earth.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
speak with a planet,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness
of a planet,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:84%
is if there is a species able
to speak and able to think.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:84%
The goal in the galaxy is
not about civilizations.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:10%
It's about how
civilizations allow

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:10%
us to talk with the planets,
to talk with the self.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
improve these new cell

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
phones to talk
with this planet we

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
needed to create
a better pattern

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to improve the hominids
becoming Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The first humans
were born in Africa,

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but the Homo sapiens sapiens
were born in the Middle East.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The human was created
around that area

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.365 align:middle line:84%
because that region there
has so much power and energy.

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the main portals
of the whole flow of vibration

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:90%
in the planet.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.720 align:middle line:10%
200,000 years ago when the first
Alithir came to this planet

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:10%
was to bring all the
information of the blood

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:10%
of every other
being to communicate

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:10%
with the blood of the planet.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize that
it was not about humans.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:90%
It was about the planet.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
talk with the planet.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So the first codes
from every planet

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:84%
has to be in the
water of this planet.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:10%
That's why the
Alithir came to settle

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:10%
in the islands of
the Pacific, so they

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:10%
could be in touch with the water
and bring that information.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
After that, the
other races started

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
to come to the main
portal of energy

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
in the planet, which
was Middle East.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
The plateau of Middle East with
Iran, Turkey, Arabia, Syria,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and Sinai, all of that
plateau has so much energy

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that allowed them to
come and took humans

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:84%
to make the improvement
of all the consciousness

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.530 align:middle line:90%
of other planets in this planet.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:10%
So the first ones to be
arrived to do this kind of test

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:10%
in Middle East were the Aessir.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The first humans to
be prepared were women

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
because they were able to
reproduce and to improve

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:90%
the DNA.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So women were chosen to
create this new species,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:90%
this new race.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was in what we
call now the Persian

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Gulf, which in that time
was called the Eden Garden.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:15.400 align:middle line:10%
Eden was a place where
the Aessir, the Anunnaki,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:10%
were able to test
with women, with men

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:10%
and make the improvements
for the human design,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:10%
while the Arcturians
were designing the humans

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:10%
through geometry and DNA.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
We can say, in such a
way, that Arcturians

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
were working in the
laboratory, and the Anunnaki

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
were putting the strength in
our blood by living with us,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.120 align:middle line:90%
by being in touch with us.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So both experiments were
the same in different ways.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians were
using the Anunnaki

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
so they could improve
how humanity would be.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
They needed some
species more stronger

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:90%
to be in touch with humans.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:10%
And Anunnaki, they were
the only one more similar

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:10%
to us that could live
in the third dimension

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:10%
and that were a little
bit more accepted

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:10%
by the immunological
system of the planet.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:10%
So that's why, while
Arcturians were designing us

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:10%
in geometry and patterns
and DNA from above,

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:10%
they were living with us
and using us physically.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians realized that
the pattern of the being

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.300 align:middle line:90%
is the octahedron.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And that octahedron is
like the seed of reality.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:84%
We call that the
seed of universe.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The octahedron is like a
small diamond that connects

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:90%
every reality with the self.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was
to improve the chakras,

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:84%
not only to be
engines to move energy

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
but also to be itself a
being, each one of them.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to
improve our way of walking

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:84%
to be straight, looking
forward, and to align

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:84%
every code of the octahedron
one over the other one

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
so the flow of energy
would be better

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and we would be able
to channel like trees,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
the light and the darkness
all in the same correct way.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways to
channel information.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.830 align:middle line:10%
One way is surrounding Earth,
doing like horizontal moving

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:10%
of energy.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:10%
And there is another
way, vertical.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:10%
So animals move the
horizontal, and we

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:10%
were the only ones uniting the
consciousness of the vegetals

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:10%
and the consciousness of
animals by being animals that

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:10%
can breathe and be like trees.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
This improvement
of consciousness

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in geometry and patterns help
us to channel the information

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and to be connected to
the network of information

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
of the whole universe.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Being in this shape,
with our heads

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.890 align:middle line:84%
up, looking to the
sky, what allows

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
us was to become like
hills, like mountains,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:90%
downloaded all the information.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:10%
And that moment that we
became like the torus

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.520 align:middle line:10%
itself, in geometry
within, we were

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:10%
able to download all the
culture information that made,

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:48.050 align:middle line:10%
in just 50,000 years,
made a very quick leap

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:10%
in the creation of
Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
When a being realizes
that he or she is,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%
the personality starts to begin.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It starts to create
the idea of someone.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So that means that for the
first time, I can say, I am.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:17.085 align:middle line:84%
And the word for "I" or
"I am" in Latin is "ego."

00:14:17.085 --> 00:14:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Ego sum, in Latin, means I am.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:10%
So when I say "ego,"
it means that I

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:10%
recognize that I am an
individual separated

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:10%
from the other ones.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So when we start, we have
two stages or three stages

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.830 align:middle line:90%
to recognize the ego.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
the subconscious,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
which is very far away
from us and the meaning

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:90%
of what the ego is.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:10%
In the subconscious,
ego means everyone

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:10%
being the reflection
of just one truth.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:10%
In the unconscious,
it means the being

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:10%
that tries to survive
besides the other ones.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:10%
So in the process
of unconscious is

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:10%
I recognize that
I am a being and I

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:10%
have to survive over
those other beings.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
consciousness is

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.980 align:middle line:84%
when I recognize that I am
a reflection of the one self

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and that I have the power
to transform reality.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So in the process of creation
of humanity, naturally,

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
we are the subconscious
ego of the planet.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So we are in need to
understand who we are.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the main question
that, from the ancient times,

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:90%
we have-- who we are.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:90%
Why we are here.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the subconscious
answer and questions

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.860 align:middle line:90%
that the planet has.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the unconscious.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
The unconscious ego is the ego
based on the animal and plants'

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:90%
I have to survive.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I have fear.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So this ego is the same
than the other ones,

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
but it is willing to eat
as much energy around

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:90%
to survive itself.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the ego we are more
related to because we are still

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:90%
unconscious.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:10%
Naturally, in this
world, all animals

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:10%
tried to live as
short as possible.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:10%
And that's because our
main goal and the only goal

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:10%
was to improve genetics and
to pass the information as

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:10%
soon as possible.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we needed to
reproduce as soon as possible,

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:10%
so we could die at
the moment that we

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:10%
see that our sons
or daughters are

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:10%
improved projects of ourselves.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
So every being in this planet
doesn't have a long life,

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.880 align:middle line:84%
like a mammal, because we
needed to improve constantly

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:90%
in the world where we were.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:10%
We started to live a
lot, like many years,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:10%
like hundreds of years,
even some of them

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.540 align:middle line:10%
like thousands of years when
the first geneticists came

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:20.750 align:middle line:10%
and they adapted their
codes of DNA to our bodies.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:10%
So a few of the people, like
in Mu, like in Atlantis,

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:10%
they were able to live a
lot longer than any other.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:10%
But those people were
called the Blue Ones.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Blue Ones were
special in our planet

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
because they were
able to live a lot.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But when we say a lot,
it's different from what

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:90%
we think now.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
A few of them, because they were
more close to Arcturian people,

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:84%
they were able to live
like 500 or 1,000 years,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle line:90%
but they were the less of them.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Other ones were able to
live, like, 80 or 90 years.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:10%
For now, for us
today, that's normal.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:10%
But for that time, humans
usually used to live 35 years

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:10%
and that was too much.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So living 80 years, it
was like living a lot.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:90%
And why did this happened?

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the energy of
and improvement of DNA

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
allows us to transcend
information not only by blood

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:90%
but also by mind.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we started
to work with mind,

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
we discovered that we
were able to live longer,

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
because we were able to achieve
more information being alive.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And we recognized that
biology was not the only way

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:90%
to survive in this planet.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we improved
ourselves to live longer.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And also, because
of the programming

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA from Arcturus, it
helped some of us live a lot,

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%
like thousands of years.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:10%
But the problem with that was
that we were repeating exactly

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:10%
the same problem that we
had in the fourth dimension,

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:10%
that the idea of this planet,
as many of other planets,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:10%
is to improve the being and to
transform ourselves constantly.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
For the sixth
dimensional beings,

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:90%
death was not the ending.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It was going to the cocoon
to become a butterfly.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:10%
So it was a process that
we needed to transcend

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:10%
our idea of who we are.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the one self is just
one but reflected in so many

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that we needed to
experience those

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:90%
many to understand the self.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we needed to die.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:10%
In one hand, we have the
process of, the natural process,

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:10%
that helped us to die because
we needed to improve ourselves.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:10%
And in the other hand,
there was some other beings

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:10%
that were trying to
structure ourselves

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:10%
so much that they created
so many illnesses, viruses,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:10%
and lots of things
that could attack us

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:10%
so we could not live longer.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And their main
goal was that if we

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
don't reach farther than 33
years old or 35 years old,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
then we will never reach
the moment of alignment

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
in emotions.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:84%
The first part of our life,
which is until our 21-24 years,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is the time when more
energy we create.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So for many beings
from other dimensions,

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
if we reach how to
handle by ourselves

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that amount of energy,
it meant the end

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:90%
of their harvest of energy.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's why also
from other dimensions,

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:10.130 align:middle line:84%
they needed us to die
as soon as possible

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:15.860 align:middle line:84%
so we could have as much energy
we could have and then die

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and create a new one,
a new one, a new one.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.880 align:middle line:10%
So we would never reach
the age of balance, which

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:10%
would be after 52 years old.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.620 align:middle line:84%
So in different
dimensions, there

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.460 align:middle line:84%
were different projects for
us to shorten our lives.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So there were many reasons
why we had to live shorter,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:90%
because we needed to transcend.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:10%
In just one word, we
needed to transcend.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:10%
So that's why if we live
for thousands of years

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.150 align:middle line:10%
without consciousness what we
could do is to kill the planet.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:10%
Because the only ones that
can live thousands of years

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:10%
are the beings that are
aligned and balanced

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:10%
with everything in the
planet, like the oldest trees,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:10%
the mountains, the minerals.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, imagine a
civilization like us

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:10%
that lives in unconscious,
living thousands of years

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:10%
and using their resources
for thousands and millions

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:10%
and millions and millions
of people that doesn't

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:10%
know how to handle a planet.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we need to die,
otherwise, the planet will die.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.900 align:middle line:84%
The beings from
other civilizations

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
also had to go through the
subconscious and unconscious

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:90%
ego to reach the conscious ego.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:10%
When they reached
the conscious ego,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:10%
they just recognized
that they were

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:10%
an expression of their planet,
an expression of the galaxy,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:10%
an expression of
their own stars.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So they recognize the
power of the self,

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:84%
but they respect the power
of the other selves, which

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.070 align:middle line:84%
they know they are other
parts of themselves.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So ego is something
really useful in evolution

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.240 align:middle line:84%
because in the first stage,
it helps us to survive.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Ego helps us to understand
that we have to keep living,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.190 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
transcend information

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
through lives, through
death in our whole lives.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:90%
So ego is not something bad.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:10%
It's what makes you
know who you are.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:10%
The problem of ego is
when it's unconscious

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:10%
and you think that you have to
survive in your environment,

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:10%
that you have to fight in order
to take care of your place.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the animal
way of thinking.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to
do is to improve

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
our ego, which is the self,
which is the octahedron.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
When we have this
organized being

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.460 align:middle line:84%
in every one of
our chakras and we

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
have this alignment in
every one of our chakras,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:84%
the ego stops being something
that tries to make us survive

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and becomes something that
helps us to recognize who we are

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.335 align:middle line:84%
and the power to
transform reality.

00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:10%
It's important to know that
within many thousands of years

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.440 align:middle line:10%
trying to go outside
this planet and still we

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:10%
do today, looking
to the stars trying

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:10%
to see from where we came
from: gods; aliens that

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:10%
came from the stars to
create us and in such a way,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:10%
we are trying to go back home
and try to reach the stars

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:10%
and to see the heavens.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.330 align:middle line:10%
But the reason why we were
here is because Earth.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:10%
It's not because we
were created on Earth

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:10%
to go outside the planet.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It's because in the
structure of the universe,

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
every planet is a portal
to get into any dimension.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:10%
And to recognize that we
humans are Earth and that's

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:10%
the meaning of human.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:84%
"Human" means in
Latin, "earthy."

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.230 align:middle line:10%
So when we recognize
that we are Earth,

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:10%
that we are part of Earth and
that everything that happened

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:10%
in our history,
it was to teach us

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:10%
how to be bounded to
this planet and how

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.750 align:middle line:10%
to reach the depth
of this planet,

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:10%
it helps us to understand
that we have an important task

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish
here, which is make

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:51.560 align:middle line:10%
this planet aware of
himself, herself, itself.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we
do in our normal lives

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is creating thoughts and
understanding for the planet.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
leave away this idea

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that we are a species
over a rock that is just

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:90%
floating in the universe.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:90%
We are this rock.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
We are this being, and
this being is thinking.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And the main reason why we
know the Earth is thinking

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.910 align:middle line:90%
is because we exist.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:10%
So when we change our
mind and stop thinking

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.680 align:middle line:10%
about Earth and
humans and we start

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:10%
to call us Earth, that's the
most important thing that we

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:10%
could do to remember that every
civilization that accomplished

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:10%
to be in the Confederation to
bring balance to the galaxy

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:10%
is not because they
reached the mind,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.170 align:middle line:10%
it's because they
reached their heart

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:10%
to be bounded to the
core of their planets.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:10%
They became their
own planets, and they

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:10%
resonate with the planet.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:59.825 align:middle line:10%
And that's what made them a very
high-level conscious beings.

00:26:59.825 --> 00:27:03.182 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.182 --> 00:27:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
how the agriculturers work
with the sixth dimension

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:90%
to influence human evolution.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:90%
