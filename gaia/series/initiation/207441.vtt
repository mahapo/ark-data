did a conflict near Sirius

uncover a plan to harness
energy from Orion's portal?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
will uncover the events

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.005 align:middle line:10%
that led to the War
of Orion's portal.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I exists; every
reality in every dimension

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and every world, every
species and every being

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
--is a projection
of the distortion

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:90%
in the sixth dimension.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension
is like the filter

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of the core of the reality,
the spark, the seed that

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:90%
creates everything.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And these mirrors that
creates all these differences

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that,
through the polarity

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
of positive and negative,
shapes the ideas

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and shapes the structures
of our realities.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So from there, after
the sixth dimension,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
the idea of races and beings
fighting each other to reach

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:90%
the truth is something normal.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Through the unconscious
way of evolution,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:90%
this fight is about food.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.020 align:middle line:90%
This fight is about surviving.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Fear, hunger are
the main emotions

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:84%
that push us towards the
light or the darkness.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And they try to improve
by eating other beings,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
by using the energy
of other beings.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It's something that,
normally goes on and creates

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:90%
the improvement of matter.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So, creates different
species, different races

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
that could be adapted to
different environments.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Through the process
of consciousness,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:90%
the fight is different.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.990 align:middle line:84%
The fight is about who
of all of these species

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
are able to reach the
main source of energy

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to create its own universe.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
When you become conscious and
you realize that everything

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
that exists, every reality
that you are in is like a jail,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
like a structure that you are
trapped in, that you cannot

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
transform yourself, that you are
all the time bounded and guided

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
by the patterns that created
you at the first time,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that you are submitted to time
and space and you cannot modify

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Then you start to find the
path, so you can get freedom.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Being free from
these patterns mean

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to let all this
creation behind and try

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to transform
everything, to transcend

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:90%
the shapes of time and space.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So once you, in
unconscious, reach

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to get every energy
from the space,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
the next stage you will try
to achieve is to handle time.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember that time
and space are exactly the same,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.080 align:middle line:90%
but in different levels.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Time is the streams that
connects everything,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and space is the conjunction
of all these streams being

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:90%
pressed by gravity.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So the only truth has
two ways of being seen.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:10%
The one that is really
tied, that is really

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:10%
whole, which is the
space, is the one

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:10%
that has all these
structures that doesn't allow

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:10%
us to go outside the system--

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:10%
what we call the matrix.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And this matrix that holds
us all in these structures

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
of geometry are all the patterns
that we keep in our blood

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
from the history
of our ancestors,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of the animals and
plants that inherit

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
their information
through thousands

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:90%
of years of evolution.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
try to handle time,

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
it's like taking by ourselves
the cords, the ties that

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
are bounding all
the gravity around.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So for the beams
of consciousness,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
trying to be free of time is
to reach the way in which they

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
can go through every dimension
and to rule its own universe.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.650 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
When you can handle
time and space,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:90%
you can create your own reality.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:90%
You can be your own god.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is why some species
that reach the conscience,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to reach
all the sources of energy

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.225 align:middle line:84%
capable to transform
themselves in a new universe.

00:05:18.225 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Because of the pattern
of the sixth dimension,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:84%
every being in different
aspects of the universe

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
were trying to build a universe
through its own image of what

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:90%
the universe was.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So for everyone, the universe
is something different.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
As for us, we have many
religions, many sciences,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
many cultures that
try to understand

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:90%
how the universe works.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, every
species in every planet

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
having a different
way to understand

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.915 align:middle line:90%
how the universe works.

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
This is how we, the species
of the conscious worlds,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
started to create the idea
of this evolutionary path

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%
towards the self.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And even though some of
us had a different idea

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:84%
of what was the self, we all
agree that if we work together,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:90%
we could reach the same goal.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:90%
This is for us like the UN.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Even if every country
thinks different

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and they even are against each
other, the organization that

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
unites every
nation, it's a place

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
where you can discuss or
talk about your own ideas

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and try to solve the problems
in a table and not in a war.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
There are many beings in
the confederation that

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:90%
work for the process of peace.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But the process of peace
is not like here, like,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
trying to speak with
each one of the species.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The process of peace
is to bring harmony

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
in the vibration
of every planet.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And because they
speak telepathically,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
they can just talk with the
species through time and space

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
without the need to
travel to those planets.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.160 align:middle line:10%
That's why for
physical forms, we

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:10%
had some kind of
parliament where

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:10%
some beings were able to reunite
and discuss about the things.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:10%
But because each one of us
has such a different way

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:10%
of thinking, the problems in the
communications were very big.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we needed
species like Vegan people that

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
were in the middle
of the dimension,

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
so they could speak
with every one of them.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So a decision that, for a
species would take 1,000 years,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and for other species
would take a few minutes,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
they would be able to speak with
them for 1,000 years and just

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
a few minutes in the same time.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:84%
The species over the fourth
dimension and the ones that

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:84%
lived through the
fifth dimension, time

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
is not a problem,
but they need space

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.460 align:middle line:90%
to understand they're divine.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So they need species to be
alive in the third dimensional

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:84%
realities, as others
need them to be

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:90%
alive in the fifth dimension.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the case of
the Pleiadian people.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
They are one of the
only species related

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
to our system that is
able, not only to talk

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
with the species in
evolution in the past,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:90%
but also in the future.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadian people can see
and experience the future,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.880 align:middle line:90%
but they cannot live it.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
They cannot be
transforming their reality,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
they can just see
it and feel it.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So when they saw the
possibilities they had in time,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
they needed matter to be their
own creators of realities.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, they needed
space and species alive,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
so they could create
their own reality

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:90%
through the sixth dimension.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
In order to achieve
the sixth dimension,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
the beings in the
fifth dimension

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
need to go through
the third dimension.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Three, six, nine are the
pattern to go to the divine

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:90%
through the matter.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
the fifth dimension

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
needs us to handle the
time and space structure.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, what happened
was some Pleiadians, not

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:84%
all of them, a few
of them decided

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:84%
to use the three
dimensional world as a tool

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:84%
to jump into the
sixth dimension.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But in order to do
that, they needed

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to be alive in the
third dimension,

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and they needed to
densify all the structures

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth dimension.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Because they were not able
to go through the portals

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.500 align:middle line:84%
of the sixth and
the third dimension,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:84%
they needed species
that were living

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension that were
able to live in the darkness,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and that they were
able to modify

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.870 align:middle line:84%
the structures in the
reality, so they could

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:90%
be born in these dimensions.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.610 align:middle line:10%
So they reached some
species that they

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:10%
were aware of how to
evolve in these realities,

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:10%
they were aware of how to
survive in material worlds.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:10%
And this would be the people
that we call the Draconians.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:10%
The Draconians are people
from the Draco constellation.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
They have these
civilizations that

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:84%
are accomplished to survive in
the most horrible environments.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
These environments
allow them to handle

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the planets.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So for the Pleiadian people
to rule the third dimension

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and to help to download
the information

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:84%
from the fifth dimension
into the third one,

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
they needed these people
to bring the information

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
in between the third
and the sixth dimension,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
so they could download the main
patterns to transform realities

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
in this dimension.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
But the main patterns
were taken care

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
of by the biggest
portals in our galaxy,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and that would be
Orion's portal.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadian people was able
to talk with all the beings

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to design
the ideas and the concepts

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth dimension.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And what they saw in the
future is that they could rule

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and they can transform these
third dimensional realities

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
into other levels
of consciousness

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:90%
creating its own universe.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Even if our goals were to
create a different universe,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
the problem was to create
a different universe

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
from ideas that are not
bounded with the core.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a distortion,
and that distortion

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
could create a black hole
swallowing every reality

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and destroying everything
that was created.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's why nobody
could just open a portal,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
they have to become
the portals in the path

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:90%
through every dimension.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.260 align:middle line:84%
That is why the Pleiadian
people used the Draconian people

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to go to the Orion's
portal and start

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
to take the energy
from them, so they

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.707 align:middle line:84%
could open by
themselves the portal in

00:12:40.707 --> 00:12:41.665 align:middle line:90%
between the dimensions.

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.780 align:middle line:84%
There was a species that,
into dimensions from Andromeda

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:84%
system to the Milky
Way system, they

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
were the ones taking care
of these communications

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in between time and
space with this energy

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:90%
that we call Protiktah on Earth.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:10%
These people were called
the Trevet for us.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And the Trevet were
these big species

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:10%
like 5 meters tall with
horns in their heads

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:10%
and all their bodies covered.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The Trevet were taking
care of the energy that

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
can open the portals between the
third and the sixth dimension.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
This magnetical energy
and frequency pattern

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.170 align:middle line:84%
that they had created
with the Merkaba

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
was a gift, a tool that
they were delivering

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to different species
treating them like what

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:90%
we could imagine as stargates.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.300 align:middle line:10%
The stargates that they
were creating were--

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:10%
so people from
different dimensions

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:10%
could go to the core of reality
and appear in another reality

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:10%
in another galaxy.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So they were the keepers
of this information,

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:90%
of this tool in a physical way.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And what the Draconian
people had to do

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:84%
was to take the
power of this energy,

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
so they could open the
portals in between dimensions.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.700 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, they
needed a lot of energy.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why Draco
people took the lead

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
of an invasion of some worlds
to take the minerals that

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
could resonate and vibrate
in different regions,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
so they could build this machine
to create a big vibration,

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to open the portal,
and to swallow

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.055 align:middle line:90%
the energy from Orion's portal.

00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:10%
And that's why they took
this species that we,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:10%
in Sirius, call Iakopti.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.530 align:middle line:10%
Iakopti were like the
hunters of this energy,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:10%
of these materials.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.580 align:middle line:10%
The minerals that
some planets had

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:10%
were useful to create this
structure, this material

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:10%
to reflect every energy
of the Suns of Orion,

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:10%
and create this pattern
of energy opening

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:10%
the portal towards
the Protiktah,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:10%
so they could bring this
energy and to transform

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.903 align:middle line:10%
the realities of
the sixth dimension

00:15:15.903 --> 00:15:16.945 align:middle line:10%

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:10%
What they did was to
invade this planet,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:10%
and one of those planets were
the one I was living in--

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:10%
Eimpah.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:10%
Eimpah was part of
the confederation,

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:10%
but we had no idea about that.

like Earth with billions

but without connection
into other planets.

We were an evolving
planet, we had no idea

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
about the parliament of the
confederation, Orion's portal,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:84%
We were just
harvesting our foods,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
we were just
enjoying our culture.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We were amphibious, we
had no idea about fight,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.390 align:middle line:90%
we had no tools to do anything.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
We were not in touch with other
species outside the planet.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But some of us in the
government had this idea

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that we were part of
this organization,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and in our planet, we had
this mineral and this material

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.890 align:middle line:90%
to be harvested.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they came to
Eimpah to take this energy,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
to take these minerals, and that
was one of the main things that

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.935 align:middle line:84%
made us know that something
was wrong in the portals

00:16:39.935 --> 00:16:40.735 align:middle line:90%
of the galaxy.

00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:42.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Pleiadian people
that were leading this project

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:84%
knew that this was
the only way they

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.490 align:middle line:84%
could download in physical
shape all the project to create

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:90%
a new reality.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But the tools that they
took in order to do so,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
were dark ones because they were
so disconnected from the being

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that they were not following
the rules of Pleiadian people,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
they were just
finding another way

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:90%
to create their own reality.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were part
of the confederation,

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
they would never say
to the confederation

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:84%
that they were just using
the power of the portals

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:90%
to create their own universe.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So what they did was to create
a conflict in Orion's portal,

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
so nobody would take care
of the portal at that time.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
That created a
main conflict that

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:42.280 align:middle line:84%
made a civil war in between
the systems of Orion.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
The main conflict was created
through the Pleiadian people.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the Pleiadian
people went to Orion

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to say to one of them that
the other part of the system

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
was trying to open the portal,
so the nine lords of darkness

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:90%
could get in.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
What we call the nine
lords of darkness

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
are the nine systems
of the galaxy that

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:90%
creates and destroys realities.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So we call them the
nine lords because they

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:84%
are very hard energy that we
can relate with personalities.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So if the portal was opened
to these nine structures,

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
all the system would be hijacked
by energies that were not

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.100 align:middle line:90%
supposed to lead the matter.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
This would be like
an opening tunnel

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
between the sixth dimension
and the third dimension,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and would allow the
low-vibrational beings

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth dimension
to transform and destroy

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
everything around in
the third dimension.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, other
parts of the Pleiadian people

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
were trying to prevent
this situation.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones working
with the confederation in order

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to protect everyone of the world
in the process of evolution,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
so this amount of energy
from the sixth dimension

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't destroy this world.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.560 align:middle line:84%
But all this was happening
through the eyes of the fifth

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:90%
and the fourth dimension.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So for us in the
third dimension,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.900 align:middle line:90%
this didn't even happen.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
For the universe,
time is something

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:90%
different from what we expect.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that has
happened or is happening

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
or will happen, it's
depending on the vibration

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
that says when it's happening.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
All the situations that
happen in the high vibration

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of the fifth dimension
are in the future.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So what they are trying
to do from the future

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
is trying to correct and prevent
that this would happen again

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:90%
in the cycles of time.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we
need to understand

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
why these problems in between
the species, the races,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:84%
has started because we have
the same problems here.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Every one of our
countries, our races

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
are trying to fight
for resources.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
won't stay just in this planet.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Someday, we will reach Mars, and
then Jupiter, and then Saturn,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and then we will reach the
energy of the whole system.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we will
reach the whole galaxy.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So we are the
seeds of the future

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.385 align:middle line:90%
to try to prevent this problem.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why every species
from other dimensions

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:84%
are trying to see how
we handle our problems

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:84%
within because when we solve
our problems in this Earth,

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:84%
it's like they're solving
their problems in the future.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So these problems
happen in the past,

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
but in such a different
level of vibration

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:90%
that for us, is the future.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And this story that
happened was the one

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that helped all
the confederations

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:84%
to decide we need
to do something

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to create these
greenhouses where

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
we can prevent the seeds to
be taken by the darkness.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
planets like Earth

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:84%
were chosen to keep all
these seeds in the past.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
All the conflicts that
we had in those species

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
around the universe
were the keys

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
towards the creation of
conscious civilizations

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
in worlds like ours
because they understood

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that the way to
solve the problems

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
through different times
and different spaces

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:90%
was to put them all together.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
world's outer cultures,

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:84%
they took the information
from all these species

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and put these vibrations
in the DNA of this hominids

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:90%
in this planet.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So we all, within,
have the information

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.470 align:middle line:90%
of all these species.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And in every day
of our lives, we

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with
all of them within.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:84%
If we can solve all the
problems of the confederation

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in our daily lives, then that
means for the fifth dimension

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:84%
that we can solve all the
problems of the creation.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
The War of Orion is
something that didn't happen,

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.580 align:middle line:90%
but it is happening.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.028 align:middle line:84%
And it's also our
past because it was

00:22:49.028 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:90%
because of that we are here.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So in different timelines,
in different spaces,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:84%
what they were trying to do
was to create new realities,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
was to create new ways of
creating new universes.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So all the species were trying
to put their best in order

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:90%
to evolve.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:84%
For some dark species, for
some very physical species

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to reach the energy so
they could transform

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
their own universe,
was the best way

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
in which they could use the
universe to help everyone

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:90%
to get united again.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So for other beings, it was
the light, the self awareness,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
so they were trying to prepare
every species in that path.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So we are now trying to use the
resources of the whole system

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
a new universe,

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%
so destroying to create.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is the main
conflict that we

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:84%
have as the Orion's portal
war because the portal

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:84%
between dimensions are
the main structures that

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:84%
helped to connect the source of
all the knowledge and energies

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to create the realities
towards our realities

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in which we are trapped
for some of them.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
seek freedom, they

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
are willing to
destroy the matrix

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:90%
and to be free from the matrix.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But what we forgot is that
the matrix was created by us.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:34.290 align:middle line:84%

create our own universes.

Through the war of Orion,
trying to destroy the matrix

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:90%
to create the new one.

this network that we have

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and to rule it from
within, and feeling

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.485 align:middle line:90%
that we are that network.

Maybe the question
you would ask is,

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
why do we need all of these
processes to reach the energy?

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
All these species
harvesting energy

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
from every planet we create

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:90%
humans in this planet?

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Why do we need all these

the time and space,
where it is --it

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:26.690 align:middle line:84%
can reach the divine
through the ninth dimension?

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.975 align:middle line:84%
Well, the short answer
would be evolution.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is why in
the fifth dimension,

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth dimension,
they all, in every species

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and every race that exist
in different planets,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
are looking into our
process of evolution
