>> Who were the 12
families of Atlantis?

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.650 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as de Stefano.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.207 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore these families

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:35.415 align:middle line:10%
and how they shaped Atlantis.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:38.394 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian people
call the first time

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:10%
when people was
created Zep Tepi.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.750 align:middle line:10%
We have two stories about that.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:10%
One story was held in many
billions and thousands of years

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:10%
through the creation of
matter, heaven, water,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:10%
and air in this planet.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So the main idea
of Zep Tepi was try

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:84%
to explain how everything
was created in thousands

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and millions of years.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Because it was impossible
to explain the past,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:90%
we talked about circles of time.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So we wouldn't say it happened
billions of years ago.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
We would say, one cycle,
two cycles, three cycles.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So these cycles of time for
us were called like years.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:10%
And a year would have millions
of years inside of it,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.175 align:middle line:10%
but for us, was a short
period of time of creation.

00:01:37.175 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So Zep Tepi would explain
how those billions of years

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:84%
were created, but mostly
describe the creation

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
of human species on Earth,
which was in between 200,000 BC

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and 20,000 BC, which was
the period in which all

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
the beings coming
from the sky start

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:84%
to shape the idea of
Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And then from 30,000
BC to 20,000 BC,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
they started to create these
civilizations, and these men,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
women gods here on Earth.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So what they describe
is how everything was

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
created in two different times.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
The creation of the universe,
the creation of Earth,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and the creation of our
species here on Earth.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The Khef people that was
created in the Middle East

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
by the Aessir were brought
to the Atlantic Ocean

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
so they could be really far
from those that would harm them,

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:90%
that would slave them.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The first islands to be
populated by them where

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Khefu, Ekaron, and
Evnoh, Khefu being

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Green Cape, Ekaron the Canary
Islands, and Evnoh the Azores.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:10%
These three groups of
islands were the first ones

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:10%
being used by them, and the
boundaries of their region

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:10%
was the Sahara Desert.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The first stage of
this culture was

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
to divide the main island in
12 regions that were controlled

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:90%
by these 12 families.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
These first settlements
in those regions

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:90%
were very poor, very human.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were not in touch
with the alien civilizations.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
They were not in
touch with Arcturians

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that are directly
with Aessir directly,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
because they were being
kept like in observation.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
They were there like any
human, like Neanderthals,

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:84%
like any other, just watching
how these new species was

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:90%
able to adapt to the planet.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
What were their abilities
inside to create

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
a population, an organization?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.630 align:middle line:84%
What the ancient beings,
the confederation beings

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:84%
wanted to see from these
first stages of humanity was,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
what are the abilities
that they had within

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to remember, and to take
it out by themselves

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.165 align:middle line:84%
without the teaching of
anyone from the stars.

00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
The name Khef means the
ones that were designed

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
for the flow of the truth.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
That is not only the culture
that is in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the culture of those
humans that were designed

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:90%
for the flow of the truth.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The sound "kh"
means the architect.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:90%
The sound "e" means the truth.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And the sound "f"
means the flow.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:90%
So the snake.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were those of the truth

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of the snake, the flow of the
water, the flow of the truth.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were designed to
bring that flow of the truth.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So Khef were the culture created
all around the Mediterranean,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
connecting the Middle East
and the Atlantic Ocean.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So every settlement of all
the Mediterranean, Europe,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Middle East, North
Africa, and the Atlantic

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Ocean where called the Khef.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:10%
But of course, the capital--

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:10%
because the 12 families
were settled in the Atlantic

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:10%
Ocean, the islands, they were
called the Khefis, or Khefian,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:10%
the more important people, and
the capital of them was there.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why every culture
in the Mediterranean Sea

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the continents
remember that they were

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:90%
the ones holding the horizon.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The horizon because the
sea of the Atlantic Ocean

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:84%
was the limit of
their known world.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So those were the last islands
where the heaven and the Earth

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
was connected.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they called them
the keepers of the horizon,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
or the ones that
hold heaven on Earth,

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
because their purpose was
that-- to hold heaven on Earth.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in
Greek mythology,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:90%
they called those big people--

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.070 align:middle line:84%
these blue big people
that hold the heaven

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
on Earth between water and
the sky, which both are blue--

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:84%
the blue ones, and
the Atlanteans.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:10%
The Atlas is the
mountains that are

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:10%
in the end of the Mediterranean
that hold the sea and the sky.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the meaning of
Atlantis and Atlantean people

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:10%
came.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:10%
It was because of
Greek language.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:84%
The 12 families of
Atlantis had the concept

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:90%
of what they represented.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
They were the different
houses and different tribes

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that would represent
the concepts

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:90%
of the constellation on Earth.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So they had the symbols of the
constellations and the animals

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
that represented them,
like the lion, the sheep.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Every animal that represented
the constellations

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.960 align:middle line:84%
were representing
also the families.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:84%
But at the first stage,
they were just the families.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The 12 families that were
living in the same island,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
and they were sons of Aessir
and sons of Arcturian people,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:90%
but they were also humans.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So they had the line
of Arcturian blood.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were
called the blue ones.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The blue ones, even if
they were not as much blue,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
they had a weird skin color
of blue because of the blood.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.430 align:middle line:10%
They had still
this way of looking

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:10%
that was different from other
humans that were on Earth,

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:10%
so they were trying to
hold the lineage of blood

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:10%
so they could survive
with information.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:84%
They knew that in the
DNA and the blood,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
they had the different
codes of the information

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of every constellation
through the blood of Arcturus.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they wanted to
keep that information alive.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:84%
Even if they were
living with other humans

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:84%
from Earth that
had red blood, they

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
were trying to keep that
blood alive so they could be

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:90%
representing heaven on Earth.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Each family has its tribe
with humans surrounding them,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and the humans were
trying to protect

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
this people because they
were the information alive.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We understood that
the blue ones were

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:84%
the people that kept that
information from the stars

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So they were the
priestesses, the priests.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
They were the leaders
of the wisdom.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
These 12 families were born
by the main sons and daughters

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Aessir, and all of them
were called the sons of one

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
of those 12 kids.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they
attach the word "Is"

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:84%
in the end to say that
they were from this family.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:10%
So the 12 families were named
Mifis, Akaostis, Meiehis,

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:10%
Khomobis, Koyris, Lioris,
Karianis, Warianis, Isthiis,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.980 align:middle line:10%
Banis, Fidhis, and Gabenis.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:09.160 align:middle line:10%
These 12 families were
split in the main island.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:10%
And a few of them used to live
in the hills, and another ones

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:10%
in the shore.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So one of them start
to become like sailors

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:90%
that connected the islands.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The main connection
of the islands

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.080 align:middle line:90%
was because of commerce.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So they would bring in some
foods and some minerals

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:90%
from different islands.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But they had this law that
prohibited to touch Africa.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
They said that Africa
was ruled by giants,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:84%
so they were not able to touch
them unless they want to die.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:10%
So there was all these
stories that if they

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:55.330 align:middle line:10%
would touch Africa or Europe,
the Nemnir or the Aessir

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:10%
will kill every human.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
That took Atlantis
for a long time

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
living in the same
islands, and being

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
worried about opening
the doors to conquer

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:84%
the world because they
were afraid of those people

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:14.127 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, even if
they didn't exist anymore.

00:11:14.127 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
When the 12 families,
the 12 tribes

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
recognize their power along
the islands of Evnoh, Ekaron,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and Khefu, they understood
that they were not

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:90%
the rulers of the civilization.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
They were not the ones having
to control the population.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones keeping the
information from the stars.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:90%
They were not able to rule.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They were able to guide
through their knowledge.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the civilization
doesn't had these 12 families

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
ruling the Atlantean
population, but guiding them.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, in between
the humans, usually

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
they choose a representative
of those humans

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:90%
to become king or queen.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And the king or queen had to
ask for wisdom to the 12 ones

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
every time that a
decision has to be made.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So the 12 ones were
like a circle of debate

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the important
stuff, and the king was--

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:84%
or the queen were the voices
to the rest of the population

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:90%
with the same blood.

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
That's because for
the Atlantean people,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
they thought that
it was important not

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
to become the same
like their fathers

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:90%
and mothers, the Aessir.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to
people trust them.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
trust them, they had

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to pick a representative
in the same blood.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But the 12 families also had
a representative in the skies.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And these were the real
blue ones, the Arcturians

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:90%
that lived on Earth.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.940 align:middle line:90%
There were not many.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe 50 or 30 people.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And they all lived in
the highest mountains

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Canary Islands.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:10%
And they were called the
settlement of Taabathar.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:10%
Taabathar was the lost
city, as they call them.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:10%
And it was a very
tiny population

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:10%
in a very tiny settlement
that we may see or imagine

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.900 align:middle line:10%
very shiny because
of the quartz,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:10%
because of the crystals
they were using

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.041 align:middle line:10%
to hold their information.

00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
When the population of the
islands started to grow,

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
there was this idea of
going out the islands.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But the 12 families said that
humans weren't really prepared

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to go out.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So the 12 families were asking
advice to the Taabathar people.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Taabathar
people also used

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
to say that we needed to be
more prepared to understand

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
our purpose on the planet
before we go around the planet.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
The Taabathar people said that
before we could understand

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
the main reason why
we were created,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
we needed to be more
grounded to this planet.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
advised the families

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:90%
to not go out the islands.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was that the
population from the islands

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
was willing to reach
for more resources

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to keep growing
their civilization.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So this brought a problem
in between the two kinds

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:90%
of kingdoms.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
The blue ones and the humans
started to have disagreements.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.860 align:middle line:84%
The Taabathar people,
the real blue ones,

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
were telling the 12
families what to do.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And the 12 families tell the
king and the queen what to do.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the king
of that time said,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:84%
we are not able
to go out, and we

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.705 align:middle line:84%
will punish anyone going
outside the islands.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We usually think about Atlantis
as a very advanced civilization

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that used spaceship,
and crystals, and light,

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and they travel through all the
planet in these big machines,

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.580 align:middle line:90%
or these big cities.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the
beginning of Atlantis

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:47.670 align:middle line:84%
was more related to a human way
of surviving in this planet.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
My memories of the beginning
of Atlantis, this was--

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.980 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't in spaceship.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:90%
It was people riding donkeys.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So they were reaching the world
sailing on these boats made up

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
with wood and
grass, and they used

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
to ride donkeys to get
to the highest points.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
They were dressed
with animal skins.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
We can think about
really ancient people

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%
and not really advanced people.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why the first
way they understood

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to go through time and space,
it was that all time and space

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:90%
was created by vibration.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And that vibration is
held in stones and water.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's why 15,000,
16,000 years BC,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:84%
they start to create
all these settlements

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:90%
to cross time and space.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to
cross time and space

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
was to build structures
that remember

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:84%
how the time and the space
was built in circles.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
started to create towns

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
with stones and water in
the shape of a circle.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.530 align:middle line:84%
All the ancient structures
built in circles in Europe,

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:84%
in Middle East, in Africa, all
the regions that you have stone

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:84%
circles and buildings
in the shape of a circle

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:90%
were built by these families.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So this structure was repeated
in every part of the planet

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:84%
with stone circles,
so we could go

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
through the space
in the three times.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And time was recorded
in the memory of water.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they used to put
water in between the stones.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
have these canals

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in between the three circles.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why we remember
the Atlantis cities being

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
these three rings with stones
creating a ring of stones

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
representing the past in
the structure of the matter,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
then another ring of
stones and temples

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
representing the
present, and then

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:84%
another ring of
circles in the middle

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.340 align:middle line:84%
representing the future and
the connection with the matrix.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.910 align:middle line:84%
This way of connection helped
them to reach the information

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
through past,
present, and future

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:29.380 align:middle line:84%
along every timeline and
every space in the creation.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So these vibrations that they
achieve through the chantings

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:84%
was the idea of becoming the
builders of time and space.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.740 align:middle line:84%
They used to bring the
spirit to the Earth.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:84%
The "kh," the first invention
of the consciousness,

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
was to download the
information of the higher level

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.560 align:middle line:84%
vibrations, the higher level
thoughts, ideas of the mind,

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, and
being download here

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.900 align:middle line:90%
on the water and the stone.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And every structure was
kind of a circle that had

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:90%
water in the middle or below.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So they start to
create this path

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:84%
towards the core of the
planet in the stone circles

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
going down in the
spiral or circles,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
or going up in the
shape of a hill.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:10%
These two structures help them
to create the idea of a sphere.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So this perfect sphere that
they were trying to connect

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:84%
was to bring the information
from other levels

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to this
planet and to this matter.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why they were called
the ones building the doors.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what shaped
the idea of Atlantis being

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
now this civilization with a
purpose to open the portals,

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.450 align:middle line:84%
open the doors of the
planet, of the consciousness

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
of the galaxy,
and bring it here.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:10%
That's what we call the
plan of bringing heaven

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:10%
to Earth, what in ancient times,
where I was born in the river

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:10%
Nile, we used to call Ater
Tumti, the heaven on Earth.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Biologically,
humans has this idea

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
that we came from the
womb of the mother,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and we are going to
the idea of the father.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Father meaning the sun, and
the mother meaning the Earth.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So all the caves represented
the womb of the mother,

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and the sun represented the idea
or the purpose of going farther

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:90%
of our mother and father.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:90%
This is just human.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:10%
But when we started to
create this idea of a bigger

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.850 align:middle line:10%
mother and a bigger father,
we took the idea of the womb

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:10%
and created these
chambers, and we

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:10%
created the idea
of enlightenment

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:10%
to recognize the power
of the father within.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So not just looking to the
sun, but looking within the sun

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
that we own in our
heart and our mind.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So by going into
the chambers, we

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:84%
could be reborn into the
light from our inner sun.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And this concept
of cultural beings

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:84%
helped Arcturians
to recognize that we

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
were awakening the idea
of how the universe works.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Not only through biology,
but using biology as a way

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
to understand the spirit.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that was the moment where
the confederation understood

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.940 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantean
people were not just

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:84%
people going around the planet
in their search for resources.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They were also beings
that recognized

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that their power,
the inner power

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
was to look farther,
and not only

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the horizons of the planet,
but also the horizons of stars.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
When they recognized this, and
they saw the power of humanity,

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
that was the time when
Arcturian people came again

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:90%
to the 12 families.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And they gave them a purpose.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Each one of them
represented a constellation,

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:23.060 align:middle line:84%
so each family had the goal
to reach a part of the planet

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:29.480 align:middle line:84%
where that constellation brings
the information to our Earth.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Along this story,
there was one family

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
that has its roots
in the Khem family.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:10%
And they were the Khomobis.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:10%
The Khomobis was one
of the families that

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.250 align:middle line:10%
disappeared in the history
of Atlantis families

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:10%
because they were
the ones deciding

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:10%
to open the doors of Atlantis
to go around the world.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
As the Khef people were those
with the flow of the truth,

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and they were built to make
the flow, the Khom used to say,

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
we are the builders
of the portal.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
"Kh" means the creators
and the designers.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
"O" means the fruit
of the design.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And "M" means the doors.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:27.080 align:middle line:10%
So Khom would be those who open
the doors to a new creation.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were called Khomobis.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:90%
"Ob" means holy.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So Khomobis is those people
that are holy and opens

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:90%
the doors for a new creation.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Khomobis were
the ones encouraging people

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to sail to Africa
and Europe in order

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to help humans, and help
the blue ones to reach

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:90%
all the world.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
After they did
that, there was kind

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.840 align:middle line:84%
of a fight, a little
war, in which the 12

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
families of Atlantis were
against the idea of people

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:84%
going out in the Atlantic Sea
and opening what they call

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the white and the
black portal, which

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.850 align:middle line:90%
is now the Gibraltar Canal.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So the Khomobis were
exiled from the islands.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And they began their search
of those biggest porters

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%
in the planet by resonance.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:90%
They had to sing.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They had to look
for those portals.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
They had to find them in
the highest mountains,

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
in the deepest lakes, in
the seas, in the islands,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.860 align:middle line:84%
everywhere so they could find
the information of the stars

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.430 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:84%
The planet is like a
living being breathing.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And it has, we can
imagine, 12 noses

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
that are breathing
in, breathing out.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:10%
And these portals are
bringing the information

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:10%
from the higher levels
of consciousness

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:10%
to the core of the planet.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So if they would be able
to reach those places,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:84%
then Atlantis would become
not only a civilization

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic
Sea, but they would

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:84%
become the species that could
represent what we named Earth.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.760 align:middle line:84%
When the Khomobis reached
to open the portals

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.990 align:middle line:84%
in between Africa
and Europe, that

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:84%
meant that it was the time
for all the humans and all

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.270 align:middle line:84%
the blue ones living in Atlantis
to go to the Mediterranean Sea,

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
and to start to bring
their civilization.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:10%
They settled the
first settlements

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantean civilization
from the family Khomobis

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:10%
in all the south of
Iberian Peninsula.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And they traveled through
the islands following

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
the lines of migration into
Ibiza, Majorca, Menorca,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and then the islands of
Sardinia, Sicily, Crete,

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%
and Cyprus.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
All the islands that
they could reach

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:84%
helped them to feel
more safe because they

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:90%
were born in islands.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the first
settlement were in islands.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
From Cyprus, they reach
the eye of the snake.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
The eye of the snake, the
story of the eye of the snake,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:84%
they said that all
Atlantean people

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:90%
were born from this big snake.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So they were wondering which was
that snake, until they figure

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.080 align:middle line:90%
out that it was the Earth.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
It was this big snake that
would go all around the planet.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And the head of the snake was
in Anatolia, now called Turkey.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they reached
the center of that region.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they start
to travel through the heart

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.630 align:middle line:90%
of the snake in Iran.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:17.580 align:middle line:10%
This helped them to find the
settlements of the ancient Khef

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:10%
people that were born by
the Isir in Middle East.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.680 align:middle line:10%
So they start to
control again the power

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.840 align:middle line:10%
of the heart of the snake.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The stories that they were told
in the islands become true.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So they start to
become the rulers

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:90%
of the whole Mediterranean Sea.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.080 align:middle line:90%


00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, MatÃ­as de Stefano.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will dive deeper

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
into the war between
Atlantis and Mu.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:90%
