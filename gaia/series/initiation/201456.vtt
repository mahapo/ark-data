00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Why was the Mu
civilization created?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.820 align:middle line:10%
In this episode,
we will explore how

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
did the sign of
this civilization

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:10%
affect human evolution?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Humans are the proof that
the planet is thinking.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And the planet is an
alive being, living being,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:84%
that has its own
organs, its own blood.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And we are just the neurons
of the sympathetic system

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:90%
of the neurological system.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we are just doing is
to be aware of who we are.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:10%
But why we ask who we are
and we seek the questions

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:10%
is because the Earth
is trying to reach

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:10%
that question and that answer.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So this world is like if we
tried to see a human body,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:90%
but in a round shape.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So every continent and
every region of the planet

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
would be related to one of
the organs of our bodies,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:90%
to our bones, to our blood.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And we can try to
imagine it or to figure

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
if we trace the main line of
the body in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the Atlantic
Ocean from the front.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And you will have
the breathing nose

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:90%
in the island of Greenland.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
This is what makes
the spirit to control

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
the weather by the breathe
of hot and cold air.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you have, by the
side, the pineal gland,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:90%
which is Iceland.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
From there, you can find
the whole chest of the body

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:90%
in the North Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And by the sides, the two
lungs, in the Congo forest

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
and the rainforests of Amazonia.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
The throat chakra of the
planet would be North America.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And the vocal cords would be the
Appalachian Mountains and all

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
the East Coast.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.490 align:middle line:10%
This means that
whatever happens in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:10%
that region would reach
the whole world because is

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:10%
the word, the language,
to connect everything.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:84%
In the left side of the
world we have Europe.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And Europe will be the
heart, with Great Britain

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.030 align:middle line:90%
being the high heart chakra.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Africa, south of Africa
and all the plateau,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that includes the three Great
Lakes, and Somalia, Ethiopia,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
until Tanzania, will be all
the region of the root chakra.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The root chakra will
connect with the origin

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and the strength to the
roots of the planet.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
That also connects
with South America

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
through two lines that
connects in the middle

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
with the womb of the planet,
the region that now--

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:90%
it's called Tistao da Cunha.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's the core of the
creation, where Pangaea

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:90%
was connected in the south.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:10%
Connecting to the
root chakra, Patagonia

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:10%
means the end of the
spine of the planet.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:10%
So the energy of South America,
the region of Patagonia

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:10%
with the region of
Drakensberg in Africa

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:10%
are both connected to
the roots and the origin

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:10%
to the core of the planet.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:10%
The region of
Middle East, India,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:10%
were one of the
kidneys, and also,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:10%
of course, the adrenal glands.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:10%
That means that
this region would

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:10%
be one of the most powerful
regions to clean the blood,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:10%
to create the blood, and
also to be the energy

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:10%
to create everything,
to purify the blood,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:10%
the water of the planet.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's one of the
biggest portals through where

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
all the energy to create comes.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The other kidney,
it is the region

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:90%
of Australia and New Zealand.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:84%
This region is also
creationist region, connected

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:90%
to the Mu civilization.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:10%
Asia would mean the sacrum
chakra, so the plexus.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.510 align:middle line:84%
This means that China,
Taklamakan Desert, Gobi Desert,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Mongolia, Tibet, Japan
represents the stomach,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
represents the region where
all the process of the being

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:90%
is done.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
All the water in the planet
would represent the blood.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Every river, every lake,
every sea, every ocean,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
would represent all the
registry of the blood.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:10%
And the most important
part of the planet

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:10%
is the one connecting the
whole body, the spine.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:10%
That connects all the
neurological system

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:10%
of the planet, which
would go from the Andes

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:10%
in South America,
to Central America,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:10%
and through North America,
the Rocky Mountains in Alaska,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:10%
to reach the brain
of the planet, which

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:10%
is the North Pole.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:10%
All the conscious planets
of the confederation

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:10%
used to be in the
fourth dimension.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So they were connected
through the time.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:84%
They came to this
planet many times,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:90%
many different parts of history.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there were a lot
of tests and a lot of proofs,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:84%
so we could reach the
better race of species

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:90%
to live here on this planet.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And one of the last
tests to do that

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:10%
was 200,000 years
ago, approximately,

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:10%
when Alithir came here.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantean times, we used
to call them the Alithir.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:10%
But now you may
know them as the Mu.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:10%
Mu people came here to see
if it was possible for things

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:10%
from other planets to
live in this planet,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:10%
to see if the immunological
system of the Earth

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't kill them.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
They were first trying
to attach and to be

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:90%
recognized to this planet.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And around 50,000 years
ago, the people from Mu

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.680 align:middle line:84%
settle as civilization
by itself.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization came
here because of the water.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:84%
They came here because of the
portals of the Pacific Ocean.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:10%
And they reached this portal
through the energetic path

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:10%
that the Moon has left in the
biggest crater of the planet,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:10%
which is at the Pacific Ocean.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
In between that region,
the islands of the Pacific

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
were the places
where it was better

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the
oceans and the water.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose was to be
a bridge in between heaven

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and Earth, to relay the
information from other levels

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness to this world
through the oceans, which

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:90%
are the blood of the planet.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:10%
All the water of the planet
is the recordings, the DNA,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:10%
the main cells of this planet.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So all the information that
came from the stars first

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:90%
reached the seas.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And the water put
that information

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.340 align:middle line:84%
in the blood of the
planet so every species,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:84%
every plant, every animal, could
have that information within.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Since the very beginning
of the creation

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
of life in this planet,
water was the key

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.160 align:middle line:90%
to hold that information.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
the people from Mu

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
tried to build civilization
bounded to the water.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization started
to spread all over the coasts

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:90%
and islands of the Pacific.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:10%
But also reached, in
thousands of years,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.730 align:middle line:10%
the deserts of North America,
South America, and Asia.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But also, they
were the ones that

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
were taking care of the most
important humans created

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, which were the
original people from Australia.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:84%
For Mu people, who
were for thousands

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of years trying to
understand humanity,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
they understood that
those who are rooted

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to the planet and
that understood

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the power of the stars are
the most important beings

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
in the planet to
hold information

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.030 align:middle line:90%
and to vibrate with them.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Vibration, frequency,
is the language

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:90%
to transform realities.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the main things that
they gave to us as humanity

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
was the gift to remember
that we are from this planet.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:10%
And that even if part of
our blood, of our DNA,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:10%
comes from heaven, we
should never forget

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:10%
that the divine is living here.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's why one of the
most important things that we

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:84%
can have from them and
we inherit from them

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
was taking care of this planet,
of the water of this planet,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
and to hold this information
and transform in this planet.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis used to know,
too, that in order

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:10%
to have the power of
god and the goddess,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.710 align:middle line:10%
you have to become the
god and the goddess.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And the way you should do
that is becoming every part

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:90%
of the god and the goddess.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:10%
And the way you do that is, if
you want to talk with the storm

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:10%
you have to become the storm.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:84%
If you want to have
the wisdom of a tree,

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%
you have to become the tree.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So they taught humans
how to become and channel

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
the information through their
blood, through the vibration,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:90%
resonating with the divine.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the ancient
shamans were able to be nature.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were
able to talk with the world.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:10%
And Australian people, the
original people, at that time

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:10%
were the first ones
to recognize that they

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.350 align:middle line:10%
were living like trees,
living like animals,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:10%
but with the
consciousness of the stars

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:10%
because they didn't
use much words.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:90%
They used singings.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So they were chanting
to the Earth.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were the first ones
to know how to become nature.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were protected

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
because Australia is one of
the continents of the creation.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:10%
The plateau of India and
Australia are connected.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:10%
And they represent the
kidneys and the adrenal glands

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:10%
of the planet,
the sacrum chakra.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:10%
So the creation, the
strength of creativity

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:10%
that moves the world,
is in that region.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it was
so important to keep

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:10%
that safe the most time
possible until the high heart

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:10%
chakra of the planet
would reach the creation.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And that was Britain.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Mu has different settlements
around the Pacific Ocean.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
They had different portals
in different regions.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:10%
So they could hold information
of the biggest portal

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.520 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the Pacific.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:10%
They had this structure
of a cube holding

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.050 align:middle line:10%
all the information in four
biggest deserts around,

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:10%
so those places.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember, then, the more
ancient spots of water

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and the most ancient records
of water of the planet.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.750 align:middle line:10%
Those places would be the
desert of North America;

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:10%
the desert of Peru,
Chile, and Bolivia;

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:10%
the desert of Australia;
and the desert of Taklamakan

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:10%
and Gobi in Asia.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
These four pillars around
the triangle in the middle

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:84%
were holding the
information of the portals

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of the water from the
desert because those regions

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
where once in history the
most deep places of water

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:90%
in geography.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And by the movement
of continents,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
they put that water
really up in the heavens,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:90%
in the highest mountains.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why they
settle in Australia,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:10%
in Taklamakan and Gobi
in Asia, in the desert

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:10%
of North America
and South America,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:10%
was because they needed
information from the water

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.340 align:middle line:10%
today and the water yesterday.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:10%
So the water that went to
heaven was the highest points

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:10%
of those four places.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:10%
That's why the desert
represented for them

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:31.560 align:middle line:10%
the waves of time; of the cycle
of expression, experimentation,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.850 align:middle line:10%
integration, and
transcendence of the water.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:10%
And in the middle they
had this triangle.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:10%
The triangle between
these four deserts where

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:10%
the islands of
Hawaii; the islands

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:10%
of Rapa Nui, Easter Island;
and the islands of New Zealand.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:10%
This triangle in the
middle was the focus

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:10%
of the information
of the Trinity.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.650 align:middle line:84%
This represented the wisdom,
the will and the love.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:10%
And in those three places,
they had these settlements

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:10%
to take care of the portals
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:10%
And in the middle
we had the circle.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
This circle in the
middle of the ocean

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
was close by the regions of what
we call now Kiribati and French

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Polynesia.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And all this region there
was the sacred point

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
where all the
information of the ocean

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
would reach their highest
level of vibration.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:10%
They settled these
spots in the planet

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:52.140 align:middle line:10%
so they could reach the
information of the West.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Information of the
West, the wind,

00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
would bring the codes of the
stars in the biggest crater

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
because the Moon had
created that porthole

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to bring all the water, all
the blood, to this planet.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.950 align:middle line:84%
While in the other
side, the Atlantic Ocean

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
would be for the
other civilizations

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
that would work with the
mind, instead of the heart.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization was
related to the heart

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
because it was
related to the water,

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:84%
so it was related
to the Mother--

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the Mother, Earth, the
blood, the creation,

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:90%
the womb of the planet.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were recognized

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
like the beehive that
were vibrating in harmony

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:90%
around the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:84%
We used to call them
the angels of the sea.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:90%
They don't use food.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
They were just drinking
nectar from the flowers.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were harvesting energy
from the seas and the plants.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:84%
They used to just smell and
have the energy of the plants.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:90%
So they were not very human.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
They were not there
from this planet.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
They were creating their
own food through energy.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
As less food we need,
as more energy we

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
use from ourselves,
like they did,

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:84%
as more flowers we eat and take
more energy from the light,

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:84%
take from the light,
our bodies will

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
live longer as they
did because they

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't need to
transform the cells

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and to feed the
cells with matter.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:84%
They transformed themselves
and the cells through energy.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they used to
live longer because they were

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
able to multiply the
cells through vibration

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and through energy.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:10%
And they would be
levitating in the seas

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:10%
and connecting the
islands through this path

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:10%
of magnetical
fields with quartz.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:10%
The different regions or
colonies of this civilization

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:10%
were in these four continents.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:10%
And they had settlements
in Central America and also

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:10%
in the Indian Ocean to defend
the process of the Mother

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:10%
from the civilizations of the
Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:10%
People used to call Mu
as if it were Lemuria.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:10%
But Lemuria was just a region.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:10%
The region of Mu, as we
call it in Khem, was Yomiom.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:10%
And this Indian Ocean
region was made up

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:10%
with islands that were trying
to protect the Pacific Ocean.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:10%
So the goal of Lemurians were
more military than the people

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:10%
from Mu.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:10%
The people from Mu were
the ones walking on water.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:10%
There were the
angels of the sea.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:10%
And from those colonies that
defended Muans, the Lemurian

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:10%
where the stronger ones.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:10%
They were the ones that
faced Atlantean people

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and defended them.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:35.390 align:middle line:10%
So the wars that they held
was the war between the two

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:10%
sides of the world.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:44.600 align:middle line:10%
And some of the faces that
you can find in Easter Island

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:10%
are the memory of them
defending the Pacific Ocean,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:10%
defending the portal.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island is
like a small portal

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
to open the biggest portal
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why most of them
are looking inside the island,

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:90%
the center of the island.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Those are the people from Mu.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And just a few of them
are looking outside.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Those are the guardians,
the Lemurians.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So the guardians of the
Pacific were different

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:90%
because they were stronger.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:90%
They used to fight.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.010 align:middle line:90%
And they used to be more strong.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And Yom, the Yom,
was this region,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
that also reached the Middle
East because they were trying

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to protect the core of Mu closer
to the Atlantic Ocean, which

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
was the Taklamakan
Desert because some

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantean people coming
from Europe, the redhead,

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:84%
they went Taklamakan and they
seeded their information there.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And they shared
information with the Muans.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But this redhead people that
went to China, to Mongolia,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
to Siberia, to see the
information of the Atlantic

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Ocean, then became like against
the Muans in the Indian Ocean.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And that made a big war, that
were held in Pakistan and India

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:90%
around 17,000 years ago.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
That region was one of the
portals of the network.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
biggest war that people

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.300 align:middle line:84%
used to remember between
Atlantis and Lemuria.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But the name Lemuria is not
the name they had in the past.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.970 align:middle line:10%
It's the name that a French
investigator of history,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:10%
of geography, named that
region in the Indian Ocean,

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:10%
by Lemuria, because there
were these type of monkeys

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:10%
in Madagascar and other
regions in Indonesia.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:10%
So he thought there would
be lands in between.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And he called it Lemuria.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's not the name that
they had at that time.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was not a
continent, not even

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:90%
in Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
It was just a group
of islands where

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:84%
they were traveling and
sailing to defend the lands.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization influenced
all those beings in the world.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Those people that used to
walk through the ice, used

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to walk through the
Taklamakan Desert

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and go to Siberia
and Alaska, they

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:90%
were going through that region.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And they also
helped people to go

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
from Indonesia, Australia, and
New Zealand to South America.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So from the north
and from the south,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:84%
they helped humanity
to spread to America.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
When they recognized
that the Earth said

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:84%
this was the last time
they should be on Earth,

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.770 align:middle line:84%
they decided to leave Earth
and abandon all the cities,

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:90%
abandon all the villages.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And they just left the seas.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And they went to the North Pole
and the underground cities.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:84%
When they did that,
they taught to humans

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:90%
how to become like them.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So they taught some
information to the shamans

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia, and North
America, and South America,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and Australia.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the Native
Americans from the north,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Native Americans from the
south, and people from Asia

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
inherit a lot of information
about how to reach

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:90%
this self through the plants.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main information
that we have from them.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And all the information in the
fourth and the fifth dimension

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that they were working
with was stocked

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.460 align:middle line:84%
in the biggest portals
of the mountains,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:90%
along the Ring of Fire.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The Ring of Fire, of volcanoes,
hold that information in nature

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.290 align:middle line:84%
that Mu used to have and gave
to humanity and the regions that

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:90%
were in their colonies.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Every time a
civilization was ended,

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
the underground
cities were the ones

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
in charge of make a registry,
a record, of what happened.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So the underground
cities were here

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:90%
since the time of dinosaurs.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:84%
They were in the
fifth dimension.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
pillars of Earth.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:84%
They are all around, down
every lake, every mountain.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is like a network of
beings in the fifth dimension

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:90%
connecting inside the Earth.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:84%
As we connect all the reality
in the third dimension

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:84%
in the surface of
this world, they

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:84%
connect the network
in the underground,

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
as our fathers and
mothers from the stars

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
connect the network
in the skies.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is symbiotic
work, in which

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:90%
we need to work all together.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when the planets
start to connect themselves

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.410 align:middle line:84%
in different levels
of consciousness,

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the underground cities are the
first ones on contacting people

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
so we could know what
to do in the surface.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The main cities are in the
highest points of the planet

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:84%
because they connect
the information

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.400 align:middle line:84%
from the most ancient
waters in the planets, which

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
are in Tibet, and South
America, Bolivia, and Peru.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And those points are the
most important to connect

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
the information of
the whole network.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.330 align:middle line:84%
When Mu, who was a
civilization connected

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:84%
to the fifth dimension, ended,
most of them went underground.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:10%
So they kept their
information in those cities.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
There is only a
few constructions

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.890 align:middle line:90%
left from Mu time.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
is in Micronesia.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Other ones are in Easter
Island, in New Zealand.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
They are spread all around
the Pacific Ocean, and part

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:90%
of Asia, and North America.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:10%
But the memory of
them was so far away,

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:58.600 align:middle line:10%
that so many things happened
in history, that we almost

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.170 align:middle line:10%
forgot what they were.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Mu people were so subtle.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And they where from other
levels of consciousness

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.840 align:middle line:84%
and connected with
the fifth dimension

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and with this high
vibration of the water,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:90%
and light, and crystals.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:84%
They had this goal to open the
portal to the higher levels

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.810 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, to be--

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:90%
settle in this planet.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were the ones that

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:84%
discovered importance
of humans not forgetting

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:90%
from where they came from.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's why even today we have
this consciousness or memories

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:84%
of Mu people teaching
us how to be related

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to the planet,
related to nature,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.750 align:middle line:84%
related to this
period of everything.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.300 align:middle line:84%
That this period is
not only heavens,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:90%
it is also here in nature.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, because of the
awakening of consciousness

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:84%
again in the planet,
a lot of people

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is realizing again the
memory of the teachings

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:90%
of those civilizations.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
This sense and this
feeling that we

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:84%
are connected to the
planet, that we can listen

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, and that we
are becoming more vegetarian,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:90%
vegan people.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.680 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to rise the
energy and the vibration

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.260 align:middle line:90%
of our civilization.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Many people awakening
and recognizing

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:84%
the power of the
self through nature

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and coming back to read
the power of nature,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and the mountains, and the
portals that they left.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So today, one of the things
that connect us most with them

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is all this people
that are listening

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.580 align:middle line:90%
to the underground cities.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:84%
All the cities in
the fifth dimension

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth dimension
that are all around,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
in every mountain,
they are the portals

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to reach that information
that are opening right now

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to so many people that
can listen to them

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and remember the importance
of being part of Earth.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.830 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis and the 12
families that control

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:10%
this advanced civilization.
