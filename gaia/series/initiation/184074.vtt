>> Why is there
light and darkness?

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I am your host,
Matias de Stefano.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
are going to learn

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:10%
why the contrast is
important in our lives

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:10%
and how both the
positive and the negative

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:10%
can be a good thing.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We have filled our realities
as a cultural beings

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
in this planet towards
the path of light.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:84%
This path seems that we have
to go away from the darkness.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But at the very beginning
of the creation,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:84%
the light and the darkness
are just the same thing.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
They were born like two
faces of just one reality,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to push that reality
towards the creation.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So light and darkness
are not different things.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:10%
They are not different paths.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They are just the
two ways that creates

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
the positive and
the negative, that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
generates the energy
necessary to create everything

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
that we know.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So we need light and darkness
all the time and the moment

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.220 align:middle line:84%
where we saw the light and
darkness as we know today.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It was not until
the sixth dimension.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:84%
When everything begins
in the first dimension,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
the realities start
to split in two.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
This second
dimension, it would be

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:90%
the positive and the negative.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
After that, the
third dimension will

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:84%
help us to figure
out what are we

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
going to experience from
that negative and positive.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension will
give us the context of time

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
so we could experience and focus
in every timeline and space

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension will help
us to recognize the purpose

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
on all that experience.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth dimension
will create the two paths

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
in which the reality must
be taken to understand

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:90%
the creation of everything.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So the sixth dimension was
born from the third dimension.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And the third dimension was
born from the sixth dimension.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
As I said, dimensions
are not something lineal.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Dimensions are something that
has expanded in the universe.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And each one of them is
just breathing from within,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:84%
creating each other in the
interaction in between of them.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is no first dimension
that was the first one,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
and the second, the second one.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:84%
This is just a way
we can understand it.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:90%
But the sixth dimension.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It was the one that started to
create every pattern that we

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
know as material things,
but in a different way

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:90%
as we see the matter.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Matter is the structure
that you cannot change,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:90%
that it changed itself.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's conditioned
by space, and it's

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
conditioned by the time
or fourth dimension.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:84%
But in the sixth dimension, you
are not conditioned by time,

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:90%
you're not conditioned by space.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
So sixth dimension
will be the perspective

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
of the universe where you can
create your own realities,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
where you can build every
reality you could possibly

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:90%
imagine.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension we
call is the dimension

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
where the architects
of the universe exist.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists, the
people that knows

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
how to transform matter, that
knows how to reveal universes,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:84%
that knows how to be
free from time and space

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
and use it as tools.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
When you have come from the
first dimension split in two

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
in the positive and negative,
creating the third dimension

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to experience, the
fourth dimension

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to live the process
of that reality,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and then the fifth
dimension to understand

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.560 align:middle line:90%
the process that was created.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension
will be the one

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that helps you to transform that
reality you are acknowledging.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
When you have the fourth
dimension as a basement,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.972 align:middle line:84%
like a square, and then you have
the fifth dimension on the top,

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
the six dimension and
the fifth dimension

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
creates through the
fourth dimension

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:90%
the shape of an octahedron.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.695 align:middle line:90%
This octahedron start to spin--

00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
one to the right,
one to the left--

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
creating the spiral
where the whole being

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:90%
starts to be created.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:10%
So the beings in
the sixth dimension

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:10%
are the ones that
have this possibility

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:10%
to create realities.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
sixth dimension is

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
the one that was split into the
light ones and the dark ones.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
The dark ones where
the architects.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The dark ones are the ones that
take the lights, the energies,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and make a mix of
them and create

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
shapes, structures that the
spirits can experience, feel,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:90%
touch.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the sixth dimension,
we have the builders

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:90%
of the universe, the realities.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call the
darkness to that because they

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.320 align:middle line:84%
took the energy of the light and
start to split it in many times

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
like in many forms, in many
shapes, like a fractal,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to create a reflection
of the light

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and make it so
different from what it

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:90%
was that it creates confusion.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Confusion is the
distortion of light.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a distortion
of the purpose.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:90%
So why do we have distortion?

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Why do we need distortion
in the universe?

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are
light, and your goal

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
is to know what are you
capable of with your light,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
you will need darkness
to see that light.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you
cannot see anything.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
If everything is light, you
cannot figure out how to write

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.350 align:middle line:90%
by yourself.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So what darkness does is to
create matter structures that

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
helps you to find your own
light through the mirrors

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and reflections of the universe.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:10%
So at first time, it was
not something opposite.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It was something complimentary.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Light and darkness
were the ones--

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
the light ones who
creates the purpose

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and create the path towards
the recognizement of yourself,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:90%
the awareness.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And the dark ones were the
ones that took that information

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and started to create the
distortion so that beings can

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:90%
have a path of recognizement.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The dark ones were
the first ones

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
on creating matter
realities, our dreams.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:10%
I used to call the first
darkness as "ivsseubath."

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:10%
Ivsseubath was the
place of dreams

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:10%
where every being that
was certain about himself

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:10%
has to go through these dreams.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And the dreams start
to confuse the being.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So the being can
be lost and forget.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So there is a purpose of
being confused and being

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:90%
lost and forget.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of it is to find
yourself through the path.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember that
the universe doesn't

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:90%
have a goal exactly.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the
goal of illumination.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look
for enlightenment

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%
and to be in peace.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.450 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
trying to find itself

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
in different
perspectives, is trying

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to understand to
learn about himself.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So while the universe
is expanding itself,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:84%
if we have clarity
in the process,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
if you can understand
everything,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:90%
so there's no purpose in moving.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no purpose on find and
see what you are capable of.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So darkness are
the ones that says

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
this is so easy that we
have to complicate it

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
a little bit so we
can understand it.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So they created these
structures of reality

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:90%
in the sixth dimension.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The architects of
the reality that

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:84%
are like the people that
build a scenery of play.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
They create all
this stuff around

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:84%
to make it weird and
beautiful or horrible.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you need to
awake your own potential.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You have chosen these
patterns and matrix

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
of your reality, which you
will call the personality.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And your personality
are the tools

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that your soul needs to
play a role in this play.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So then you become a
character on the play.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But everything you see in
this scenery, everything

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
you see in the theater, it
will be created by darkness.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So darkness create
the surrounding

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
so you can have tools
and find yourself

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror of everyone and
everything that is around you.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So at the very
beginning, darkness

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is the one that helps
you to find yourself.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it,
you have found yourself,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and you have questions
about yourself

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
not because something beautiful
happened in your life.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
For sure, because a crisis
and something horrible

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:90%
happened in your life.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe an illness,
separations, conflicts, war.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that
usually awakes people.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Because in very dark realities
like this one in this planet,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.480 align:middle line:84%
if you cannot see the
truth and the reality,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
you will need someone to push
you or something to press

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.080 align:middle line:84%
the reality that you are living
in so the real potential you

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:90%
have within comes out.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we can relate
darkness with winter.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
We kind of emotionally
take the image of winter

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
like a moment where
everything could

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:90%
be dark and low in energy.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's winter that helps
the plants to keep the energy

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
to start in spring,
to come out in spring.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's because of that
amount of energy

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.240 align:middle line:84%
that you are working with
while the winter is out.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we need
that experience of density

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:84%
to express the potential
we have within.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why the sixth dimension
is creating all the time

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:84%
situations in which the beings,
the light beings that we are

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:84%
can express ourselves in
different many situations.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if we all have
exactly the same reality

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and the same situation
all the time,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:90%
you are not learning anything.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:90%
We need conflicts.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:90%
We need problems.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.390 align:middle line:84%
We need some stuff to solve
emotionally, mentally,

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and physically so
we could understand

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:90%
what are we capable of.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need to understand
the importance between light

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and darkness.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Light is the path to understand.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the path
to transcendence.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is just a way
in which you can feel reality.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
goal of reality.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And darkness is not a
goal, is not a purpose.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not a place
where people could go

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:90%
if they are doing bad things.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Darkness is the
tool that we have

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to create these sceneries
in which we can experience

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:90%
new realities of light.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
In planets like ours that
we have only one son,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
we have 12 hours of
day, 12 hours of night.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The whole beings,
biologically, they

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:84%
were prepared to follow the
light and escape the darkness.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
We now as cultural beings,
we talk about spirituality

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:90%
as a way to light.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And there are angels,
archangels, and seraphims,

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and all these kind of
beings in the light

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
where we have to go
to like God or whoever

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:90%
you prefer to believe in.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So we are heading to
the light because we

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:84%
say the darkness is
bad, and light is good.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is not
something spiritual.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:90%
This is something biological.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that some
being from another dimension

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:90%
told us, follow the light.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It was the first cell,
the first bacteria

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:84%
in this planet that told us
follow the light because we

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:90%
needed to feed ourselves.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we
can feed ourselves

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
was with light, with
the light of sun,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:84%
going from the very
bottom of the oceans

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
where the darkness is.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And we had to go
up to see the light

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and to eat the light
by photosynthesis.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So the process of
photosynthesis is enlightenment.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:84%
The first cell did this
transformation from itself

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:90%
through the light of the sun.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So when we transform ourselves
through the light of the sun,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
we recognize that the
light was the path that

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
transforms ourselves
and that gives us food.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So our main food as spiritual
beings, follow the light.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But the light is nothing
else but the sun.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
There is no light but the inner
light in the other dimensions.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So we are not
following the light.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:90%
We have the light within.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
When you are trying to
follow the path of light,

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.760 align:middle line:84%
you are just
following the pattern

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
that a cell billions of years
ago said to you is not real.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way to not to
be lost in this planet.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to
a planet like I

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
did once thousands of
years ago with two or three

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
stars where the night
is maybe just two hours,

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:90%
we had no problems like that.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.340 align:middle line:84%
We had no separations
between light and darkness.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea about what evil
was because our cells were not

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
built through
light and darkness.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
need to understand

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that the concept of duality
has a bad and a good thing.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
It's something that happened in
our body biologically talking.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
happened in another dimension.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.840 align:middle line:84%
When we go to
other dimension, we

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
will see that the darkness,
the demons, and the angels

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:90%
are working together.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And we can kind
of be like, what?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Why do they work together?

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Because angels are
trying to tell us

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
this is the path it
would be good for you

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.010 align:middle line:90%
to understand who you are.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But we are so focused
in the third dimension

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that the angels are like,
they don't listen to us.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I try to be soft.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:90%
I try to caress them.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I try to whisper to the ear,
hey, you have to do this.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And you are so focused on
something else and something

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
so material that the angel have
to go to the demon and says,

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
look.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You know how to
handle the matter.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So I need he to understand
that this is not his path,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:90%
that he must do other thing.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And the demon will say,
OK, I will put a truck just

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.990 align:middle line:90%
in front of him.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So he crashed and has
a crisis, an accident.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And his life changed.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So we had no time, so that's
why he needed to be like that.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
So the angel then
comes and says,

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you see that you needed to go
to another way because this way,

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:84%
there was a truck
coming from in front?

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So the constructors of
reality, what they do

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:84%
is try to show us in a
difficult and material way

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
how do we have to
evolve in this planet?

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:84%
How do we have to
move in this planet?

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
need the darkness

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
because they are showing us the
ways in which we could evolve.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But also, we as
humans, sometimes we

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
lose the consciousness,
and sometimes

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:90%
we forget we forget who we are.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.715 align:middle line:90%
They also have that.

00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth
dimension, there are

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that working
on this fractality reality

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and this distortion of reality.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
They also distortion themselves,
so they forgot who they are.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So they forgot that the
purpose of distortion

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
was to teach others
how to look themselves,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and they took
distortion as a goal.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we recognize
the darkness as something

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
evil, something bad.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But I would bet that
those people are just

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
the 10% of the whole people
in darkness working for us.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people in
other dimensions-- a lot

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of beings in other dimensions
from the darkness working

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:90%
towards our enlightenment.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And after we get
enlightenment, we

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
recognize that there
was no light at real,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that it was something
biological, that it

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
was something built by
the architects of reality.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
In the past, in the
first civilizations,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
we used to call God like the
Great Architect of Reality.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
The Architect because he knew
that the patterns of numbers

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and geometry are the base
to create everything.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
But this being was light
and dark at the same time.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
we as a third dimension

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.860 align:middle line:84%
have to understand
is that the only way

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be in balance
in between light and darkness

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:84%
is if we become
gray, gray beings.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
these gray beings

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
that we call bad people,
bad ones in other planets.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
gray I'm talking about.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
mix of light and dark.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
We are creators.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only one
you can create is

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:84%
if you have the
patterns of darkness

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:90%
and the magics of light.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
If you have both together,
if you mix both together,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:84%
you will understand that
the creation of the universe

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:90%
is just alchemists.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just alchemy that you
are using from the darkness,

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:84%
that the tools to create
come from the darkness.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you honor
them and you realize

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that they are part
of you, you will

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:90%
be free from their distortion.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So you start to be
free, and you make

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
them free from their role
to create a lot of ideas

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:90%
and sceneries for you.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So you start to live in a
flow because you honor light

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and darkness at the same time.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:10%
So the best way to understand
the darkness and light

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:10%
within us is to understand
that the sixth dimension has

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:10%
created the vehicle that we call
"merkaba" to create realities.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.520 align:middle line:10%
The merkaba is the system
of the sixth dimension that

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:10%
helps souls to split
in many other beings

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:10%
that we call the
vehicle of light.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:10%
But the vehicle of light
was built by darkness.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was not just light.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:90%
It has both.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why the vehicle of light
has a negative and a positive

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:90%
and split the body in two.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:84%
The ones that root ourselves
to the ground, to the darkness,

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and the ones that
go up to the light.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can create
a new reality and to aware

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:84%
about who you are is
by going to the center.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Not up, not below.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Just the core of everything
in the middle, in the center.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:10%
That's why the only way you can
transcend light and darkness

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:10%
as the biological
concept that we have is

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:05.560 align:middle line:10%
if you honor your roots and
honor your branches and leaves

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:10%
is the only way you can go
to the core, to the center,

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:13.720 align:middle line:10%
and create your own
and new reality.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Evolving this planet
made us believe

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:23.350 align:middle line:84%
that there are always a bad
way and a good way to do stuff.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The world is spinning
all the time.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So some places is night,
but it always changes.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Not always it's night
in the same place.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So what teaches this
is that everything

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:90%
is changing constantly.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
are the evil ones,

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we
are the good ones.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:50.890 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that
you are born with evil

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:90%
and born with good.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
This is something that was used
by religion to split people

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:90%
and to create politics.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not something real.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we use to
have order in our societies,

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth dimension, you
can see demons and angels

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:90%
working together.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
In this reality of
third dimension,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:90%
we are born together.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We are those demons and
angels looking for neutrality.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension
is the experience.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So the experimental part of the
universe, we demons and angels

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:90%
are working as one within.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Demons and angels are
not fighting like we

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:90%
do in this planet Earth.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We split their work like
if they were enemies.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But in the sixth dimension
where they were built

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:84%
or they were created,
they are not enemies.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:90%
They are partners.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Partners in the path of light
and the path of darkness.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I remember, when I
was just Ghan, my spirit,

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I used to work in the
libraries of the universe.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
When a demon or an
angel or whoever

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:84%
came to me to ask
for information,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I would give the
information exactly the same

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
to both of them because they
are a part of the reality.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So in the neutral
part of the universe,

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
we don't see the duality.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't see this fight
against dark and light.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
This is, as I said,
something biological.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why in order
to escape or transcend

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
this reality of
dark and light, you

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.750 align:middle line:84%
have to first recognize
that you are both of them,

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
that every human, ever being in
the universe is built by both

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
of them, that no one
of them is our goal,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
to go by darkness.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But you neither
have to go by light.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
They are just two tools
that we have to understand

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:90%
who we are in the middle.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
They are just two
ways to understand

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:90%
the paths, the creation.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
But they are not purpose.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:90%
They are no goals.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:90%
They are just tools.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you
realize that, you

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:84%
will see all the realities, all
the creations with forgiveness,

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:84%
with understanding,
and realizing

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that you have created
everything, that you

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:90%
are darkness and light.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
There is no dark and
light outside of you.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
You are both of them.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano,

Stay tuned for the
next episode where

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
