I am your host,
Matias De Stefano.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, I
am going to explain

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:10%
the purpose of understanding
how ancient past will

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.365 align:middle line:10%
help us evolve as humans today.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:10%
500,000 years ago,
the world started

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:10%
to split into four species
that came from the sky.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Once these four
civilizations from the sky

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
split the world in
many parts, and they

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
took the information
of humanity,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and they put their
own blood within them.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
They started to create the
races so each race of humanity

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:84%
could have the information
of one of those species.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
This was done, so as
the confederation said,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:84%
we had to be all
together in just one.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So unity for them was to put all
the blood of all of them inside

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And these four
first civilizations

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
were the test to see
if we humanity were

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.040 align:middle line:84%
able to understand,
to accept, and to keep

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:84%
being alive through the
manipulation of our DNA

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%
through 1 million years.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
When the planets
started to change again,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
humanity went through
all the planet

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and fill up every region
of the whole planet.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of populations
started to grow

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:90%
in every region of the planet.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
Many and thousands of humans
around the planet, not like we

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:90%
are now.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But huge amount of
people were living

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
in every part of
the planet, ruled

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:84%
by these four civilizations
until the planet heated.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
When the planet got a
lot of hot, and suddenly

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
the ice age ended.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So Nemnir, the giant
ones, they disappear.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
They died, and they went
away from this planet.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So the snake ones were the
ones to rule during that time.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Once the snake ones start
to go all over the planet,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:90%
another ice age came.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:90%
So they all die.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
The planet was so cold
that all reptilians were--

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:84%
weren't able to be here
to live in this planet.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
So they went away.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Humans were the only ones that
were able to survive to that,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
so they decided to
prepare humanity

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:90%
to keep going with their rules.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they created
two civilizations, where

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Alithier and Aessir could
survive through human bodies.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
To do so, they created
the civilization of Mu

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
by the Alithier,
and by the Aessir

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
they created the
civilization of Atlantis.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Both were ruled by the
laws of Alithier and Aessir

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and they separated
the world in two,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
the ones living in
the Pacific Ocean

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
and the ones living
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
were split in two

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:84%
to control the inner
world and the outer world.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
As the Alithier,
the Mu people, were

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:84%
trying to look for the
connection of the inner world,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
the Atlantean ones were the
ones to rule the outer world.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main idea
why both civilizations

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:90%
for us were in kind of a war.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Mu was the civilization that
fill up all west of America

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and east of Asia and Australia.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:84%
All the Pacific Ocean
was built by them

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and was taught by them to
all the women and men that

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
were shaman at these regions
how to find the truth within.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.990 align:middle line:10%
And that's why Native Americans,
people from Pacific Ocean

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:10%
and people from east
China, from Japan,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:10%
from South Asia
and Australia were

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:10%
the aboriginal people that
were looking for the connection

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:10%
within.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the other hand, we had
the civilization Atlantis,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:90%
where I was part of.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.380 align:middle line:84%
That we were taught by the same
people from the confederation

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:84%
how to do the look inside by
building civilizations outside.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why instead of
looking the sphere of life

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%
within in our hearts,
we were looking

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
for building those
spheres through temples,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:90%
through pyramids.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:90%
But that had a purpose.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Mu people where people
connected to the planet Earth,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
to the crystals, to the
plants, to the animals.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And they kept evolution
through respecting the planet

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and going to the main spots
of the planet by meditating,

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:90%
by levitating.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
They were communicating
each other by telepathy.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were not much humans
as the Atlantean people were.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean people
were the most humans

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
because Arthurian
people prepared

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
them to have the blue
blood, to have the strength

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to be rulers of the
consciousness of the planet.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
were taught how

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to open the portals
of the planet

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and how to be connected
to the confederation.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The way they have
to do this, it was

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.320 align:middle line:84%
by building all
these spheres of life

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:84%
in the portals of the
structure of the network

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
in eighth dimension but
here in the third dimension.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why Atlantis has this
goal of fill the whole planet

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
with civilizations
and colonies where

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.940 align:middle line:84%
they built these temples
and these pyramids aligned

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
with the network
of consciousness

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:90%
of eighth dimension.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We used to remember this story
with the name of the people

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
from Lemuria.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Lemuria is not the
name as neither was Mu,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:90%
neither was Atlantis.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:84%
These are our names
that people from history

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
used to give to understand
the purpose of--

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
or to understand
the region where

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:90%
they were supposed to live.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So Lemurian people were
not called like Lemur.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:10%
Lemur are monkeys from the
regions of the Indian Ocean.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:10%
Those kind of monkeys are in
Sumatra and also in Madagascar.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:10%
So a French guy, he
was trying to explain

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:10%
how these monkeys were connected
from this to faraway islands.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:10%
So he said must--

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:10%
there should be a continent
before that connected those two

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:10%
islands, and he
called that Lemuria

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:10%
so he could explain
why these two

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:10%
islands had the same monkey.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:90%
That's how Lemuria comes out.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It is just 200
years, old the name.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:90%
And Mu is the--

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:84%
one of the real names that
you'd have in the Pacific Ocean.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So the ones that lived
in the Indian Ocean,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
they were just trying
to protect themselves

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis, which was another
name which Greek people give

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to the civilizations that
was behind the mountains

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:90%
that they called the god Atlas.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
Atlas was the
protector of the world.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So the mountains
from there, they

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
were called the Atlas Mountains.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:90%
The sea was called the Atlantic.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And all the islands behind
that were called the Atlantidas

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:90%
in Greek.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we still today
called Atlantis Tatland,

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
but the names also
are different.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.760 align:middle line:84%
How I remember it, the
Mu was called Yomiom.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis, we used
to call Khefislion.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis civilization was
created in between the islands

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
that we now call Green Cape,
Azores, and Canary Islands.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:84%
By going out from
these small islands

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the Atlantean Ocean,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to conquer
all the regions that

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
were in the opposite
part of the world.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a
few of the Mu people

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
start a war against Atlantean
people to protect the ocean.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Most of the Mu people
knew that they were--

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that their civilization
has to end.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:90%
So they just went away.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But a few of them stayed
in the Indian Ocean,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to protect
the Pacific Ocean

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
from the Atlantean people
coming through the mountains

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
from the snake.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
During the Virge
era, while Atlantis

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest civilization
you could ever think about,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
this world order that we
have was held by the Ice Age

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:90%
that we were having.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
This Ice Age allows
us to be connected

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
to every book in history of
humanity and the whole world.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So we were a civilization
that was connected to cold,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:90%
that was connected to the ice.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And all the network
of pyramids that we

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
have created around
the world was

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
connected to the information
of the North Pole and the South

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Pole.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Through our process
of civilization,

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
we realized that we were
so split in the world

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that a few civilizations
and colonies of Atlantis

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
started to think
different from Atlantis.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So they started
to ask themselves,

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:90%
why don't we do another thing?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we do a
different thing?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean civilizations
started to be worried

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
about what happened--
what would happen

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness of the
planet and our civilizations

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
if the colonies starts
to split, and they

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:90%
start to do different things.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So the first conflict that they
had was economical, for sure.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Economies started to
run bad for Atlantis

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.290 align:middle line:84%
because the colonists
stopped giving them stuff,

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and they start to charging
them for the stuff.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
from the mainland,

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
they start to go to
leave to the colonies

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
to have the main sources to
do their jobs and all that.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So when they start to went away,
there was the second problem.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%
That was education.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%
As many people were
leaving Atlantis,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:90%
the temples were getting empty.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
from Atlantis stopped

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
learning how to be
connected to the self

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and start to learn how
to go out the island.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And they left the
temples of knowledge.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So this brought new
generations of politics

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't had this
kind of knowledge,

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of education.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So the problem was
politics after that,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
when they tried to rule and say,
we are not going to the core.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.890 align:middle line:84%
We are going to take
the colonies back.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So Atlantis has this
shift in their politics

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that was not connecting everyone
as one, but to rule them all

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and be together.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:84%
By this control that they tried
to hail around the planet,

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
they forgot how to be
connected to the planet.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So the planets start to
protect themselves-- itself--

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
from the consciousness
of civilization.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So that made that,
every node, as a flower,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
start to close and go
down to the inner world.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So the inner world start to
hold the energy of the planet.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And the outer world was not
able to get that information

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.590 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And that made that
all the books melted.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
It created a new heat era that
the planet, the Ice Age, ended.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then all this water that
was held into the libraries

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
start to go out from
the Northern Sea,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Baltic Sea,
from the Bering Sea.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
All this water start to
come down to the oceans.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
mostly remember.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And that brought a war,
a war in between colonies

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to see which one would be the
next one to rule the world.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
Atlantis made blew up

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids of
some other places,

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
so they couldn't
have the control.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So by good politics,
Egypt was one

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
of the only colonies that
allows Atlantean people to come

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and not fight them.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they re-created
this civilization like Atlantis

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:90%
in the River Nile.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
There and Mexico were just
one of the two of them

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that allow Atlantean
people to keep going.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So many of the others
were destroyed,

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
or their pyramids
were destroyed.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we don't have
now the big monuments that we

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.730 align:middle line:90%
used to have at that time.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And we had these new temples
rebuilt by the pieces

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:90%
of those ancient pyramids.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why 15,000 years
ago we left the seas

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:90%
to become river civilizations.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
next civilization

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
was Kem, the one that
was in the River Nile,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and also the ones that were
in the rivers in China,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
in the rivers of Mesopotamia,
in the rivers of Pakistan

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and India, the rivers
of America, Amazonia,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:90%
and the Andes Mountains.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:84%
This area, it was a Mu area
in which we, as beings,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
recognized the power of the self
from within, from the native.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And after that, Atlantean people
came and added its information

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to the Andes Mountains
through the Amazon River.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So both civilizations
coexisted in this area.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Both civilizations found
a point of integration.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that region there
is one of the most important

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in the planet to talk
about the new consciousness

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and the awareness
of the new time,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:90%
because it's not split in two.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Both civilizations
that fought each other

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.740 align:middle line:84%
in many other
places of the world

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
were connected as one
there in Titicaca.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why the buildings
that you can find there

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
are building built in Mu time,
like 24,000 years ago or more.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
But they were rebuilt by
Atlanteans 15,000 years ago.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were rebuilt by Quechua
people like 5,000 years ago

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and 2,000 years ago.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
So that's why that area is so
important for the consciousness

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
in the future, because
when we talk about unity,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.230 align:middle line:90%
unity will come from there.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.049 align:middle line:84%
By the end of these
civilizations,

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
the humanity tried
to understand how

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
they could put together the
inner path with the outer path.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:90%
But the age of Virge ended.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:90%
So the order disappeared.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.095 align:middle line:84%
And the ego era, the
Leo era, started.

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It was not something that they
could rule through the mind.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It was something that the
planet needed to keep going.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The planet is a
living being that

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:84%
needs to change every
2,000 or 3,000 years,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
so we could have
this transformation

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
from out and within,
within and out.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So every 2,500
years, approximately,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
the changes of the
planet starts to be felt.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's how civilizations
like those start to end.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
These two civilizations
are the key

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
of why we are now here
talking about them.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The ending of the
Atlantean civilizations

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and the war with Mu took
us to the end of the era

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.060 align:middle line:90%
in 12,000 years ago.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And 12,000 years ago is a
specific moment of time,

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.050 align:middle line:84%
where we can see each
other in a mirror.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
If you have a sphere,
and you cut it,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and you will see the circle of
four stages of the universe.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:10%
As we have spoken in
the fourth dimension,

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:10%
we had this process of
expression, experimentation,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.870 align:middle line:10%
integration, and rescendence.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:10%
By these four stages,
we have a whole timeline

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:10%
which is known as the
24,000 years of an era.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We had these 12
constellations by day,

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and 12 constellations by
night we call the Great Year.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:37.075 align:middle line:84%
The Great Year is the concept
of 12 constellations being

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:84%
in lighted, and
12 constellations

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:90%
being in the shadow.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
24,000-years circle.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And if we cut it, we
have 12,000 years.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
If we are here now, and the last
Ice Age was 12,000 years ending

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in the past, so that means
that the end of this era of Leo

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of
our era in Aquarius.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So that means that we are
exactly at the same moment

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:90%
where Atlantis has ended.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why our civilization
is also in an end.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.430 align:middle line:90%
We are finishing a process.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were also
finishing a process.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So we are exactly in the
opposite of time and space.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in time we
need to learn as a mirror what

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.810 align:middle line:90%
they did, so we do better.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the real
reason why we are all

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about
Atlantis civilizations

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
right now, not because it
was interesting to know

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
what happened in the past.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It's because we have to be
prepared about what is going

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:90%
to happen to us in the future.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of things
to learn about Atlantis

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
because they were the
builders of the network.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
that connected us

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to the eighth and
the fourth dimension.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So they were the ones
that opened this system

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.700 align:middle line:90%
to download information.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But they did it in
a different way.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They did it trying
to control, to create

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
a world order, just one group
of beings controlling everyone.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't do
that in a bad way.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
They just knew
that the world was

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
going to split in many
other parts, many colonies.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So they were worried
about what happen if they

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to be connected.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
created this world order

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to order this world exactly.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:90%
So they mess it.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:04.040 align:middle line:84%
They mess it up because
the timelines and the space

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:90%
needs to change.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be always the same.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
It needs change constantly.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
Atlantis, as Mu, did.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They had to end on some
point, so the new ones

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:84%
can build a different
way of doing it.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's important now
that we understand

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.685 align:middle line:84%
the history of Atlantis,
because we are now exactly

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:90%
at the same spot.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The ancient civilizations
and the ancient rules

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
from 2,000 years ago, they
are trying to control everyone

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.810 align:middle line:84%
because they are afraid that
if we are not controlled,

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.030 align:middle line:90%
we could mess up the world.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So the new era that is
coming is a free era,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
where you will be connected
to your own truth.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So if we had been taught
that the truth was just one,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and we call it
religion or science,

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
we are not going to be able
to see the real truth within,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:90%
which is both of them together.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is why it's important
to understand why they did,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
because now we are-- now there
are a few people also trying

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
to do a new world order to hold
us all in that control by fear.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.306 align:middle line:84%
But it's not because
fear is a tool on us.

00:23:36.306 --> 00:23:40.610 align:middle line:84%
It's because they have
fear to lose power.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And we have not--

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
we should not fight them.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We should teach
them what happened

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.600 align:middle line:90%
at the last time they did it.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.300 align:middle line:84%
We should remember them, that
it will be an end anyway.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
humanity can control.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
Earth controls.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:84%
So we have to work
together to create

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:84%
new orders but without
this fear of changing.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is the main
idea that I guess we

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:90%
have to rebuild from Atlantis.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:21.290 align:middle line:10%
We have to restore this
knowledge of the network

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:10%
around the planet of the
fourth and eighth dimension

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:10%
to have this information.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:10%
But the only way you can do it
is if you don't fear change,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:10%
is if you don't fear the
people that fear change,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:10%
that if you are able
to change by yourself,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:10%
and to acknowledge that you
have to heal your own history

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:10%
in order to create a new one.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need to learn
what happened 12,000 years ago,

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
not to see who
built the pyramids.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
It is to see that we are
going to build them again.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.976 align:middle line:90%
And we have to do it properly.

00:25:00.976 --> 00:25:03.844 align:middle line:90%

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this series.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I am your host
Matías De Stefano.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Through my memories from
the Akashic Records,

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I hope I was able to help you
understand why a thing exists,

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
why we have problems, why
we are born into this world

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:84%
time and time again, and why
you are here today to fulfill

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:90%
an even bigger purpose.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:50.656 align:middle line:90%
