00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> My dream is to help people
understand how the universe

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
operates so that each person can
find their own unique purpose

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:90%
within the cosmic plan.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.196 align:middle line:90%
My name is Matias De Stefano.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:90%
And my purpose is to remember.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Since I was three, I began
to remember a past life

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:90%
before I was born.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was normal
until many years later I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
realized people could
not see what I could see.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Usually at this age,
the brain begins

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to disengage with
other dimensions.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But mine stay active
and still is today.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
This part of my brain
that is still active

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
allows me to remember
in full detail the past

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and connect me with the cosmic
memory that unites us all.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Through these visions,
I see people and places

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and important things.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
These visions help
me piece together

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
not only humans,

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:90%
but the universe itself.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
This place I was
connected to was referred

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to me in my visions
as Thamthiorgah, which

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
means the spinal cord of
God, or as I later learned,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
the central Akashic records.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:10%
I believe I have
been given this gift

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:10%
to tap into the Akashic
records of the cosmic plan

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:10%
so that I can help
people understand

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:10%
the structure of the
universe we live in--

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:10%
the concept of our existence
and importance of things

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:10%
we ignore in everyday life that
are essential for our growth,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:10%
as we move into
the next dimension.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
In this series, we
will go beyond what

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
you have read in history books,
that civilization started

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
3,000 years ago, back
to 13 million years

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
ago when humans first
existed in the universe.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And we will go back
6,000 million years ago

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to the creation of
the universe itself.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
We will cover races
that influence humanity

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:90%
since Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We will cover alien groups in
the universe and the great war

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.150 align:middle line:90%
that took place in our galaxy.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I will share with you how
to open your heart portal so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
that you can help others.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And last but not least, I will
share how our world exists

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and why I was able
to remember it.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.340 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago, I
started on this journey.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And this lifetime, I
hope to fulfill it.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
My dream is that you
fulfill yours, as well.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Once we have the tools to
be bigger than society,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.730 align:middle line:84%
bigger than our current
bodies and larger

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:84%
than our understanding
of who we think we are,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to
contribute our unique soul

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
imprint into this
time period of change.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
My memories are bound into my
spiritual mind or higher self,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
who I call Gan, and my emotions
through my soul and its memory

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
of three specific lives--

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
one-- 12,000 years ago in
the River Nile; another one,

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
900 years ago in Scandinavia;
and the farthest one--

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
almost 16 million Earth
years ago, in Gludok,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:90%
a planet on Sirius.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin where
there was no beginning.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.590 align:middle line:84%
It's important that every
human being understand

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions, because we
live in every dimension.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:84%
We are not just
in one dimension.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:10%
We used to believe that we
are in the third dimension.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we live
in every one of them.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Dimensions are not
just a place that you

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:84%
go when your consciousness
is aware of them.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a perspective
you have of reality.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.515 align:middle line:90%
Reality is just one thing.

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:12.445 align:middle line:90%
It's just only one dimension.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just one truth.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
But that only truth has
many ways of being seen.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So as many beings can
see that only truth,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
we can have more perspective
to improve that truth.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have at
least nine dimensions that

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
are the basis of our reality.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are now able just
to see the third dimension,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:90%
to feel the third dimension.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But we actually live
in many of them.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why when I try to explain
where we come from or who am I

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
or what is the truth of
this reality of this planet

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and the history of
humanity, I will not

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:90%
explain the whole truth.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I will not explain
the only truth.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling the part
of the truth I've seen.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I start to remember
every dimension when I

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:90%
was 15 years old in this life.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was for me
the first time I

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:84%
changed the way I saw the
universe, because I realized

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that I was just a
projection of the universe,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and in my mind
was trying to look

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
for the place and the time,
where I could understand

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
every dimension and from where
I could explain every dimension.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:10%
And the first place,
where I found the best way

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:10%
to explain them was in
one life millions of years

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:10%
ago in this planet I remember
with the name Gludok,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:10%
the constellation of Canis
in the star of Sirius.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
In that life, I was
kind of a politician

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:90%
in charge of a neighborhood.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
But we were not like a
society we have here on Earth.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We were every one of us like
neurons, conscious neurons

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
In our society, we knew
that we were not alive,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:90%
because we were a civilization.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
We realized that we were
the thinking of the planet,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that the only one
evolving was the planet.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So every one of us
had this knowledge

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that if we are the evolving
consciousness of the planet,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.370 align:middle line:84%
every one of us had
to know the truth.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we share every part of
the truth as a civilization,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
we can hold the
knowledge of the self.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in that life
for me was the first moment

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
I could explain and I
could feel and understand

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:84%
every reality and
every dimension,

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because we were meant
to know every dimension

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:90%
as our normal life.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
For us in our civilization
in that planet,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
we used to see
reality and our life

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:84%
like going through
every dimension

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
in practicing every
year of our entire life

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we were
learning about ourselves

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:84%
in many perspectives
and many dimensions.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
So for us, it was normal to
go through this knowledge.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was not from the mind.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can go
through every dimension

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
is from the heart, because
the heart is the only one that

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:90%
can feel before understanding.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Mind is just the process
to understand the reality.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings are the way
you can go through that reality.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why we were a
very mental civilization.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we had to
understand everything,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
we just have to be
silent and feel it.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I've learned
in this planet about dimensions

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
was that dimensions are
just different perspective

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:90%
of just one truth.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We were taught that the
truth is like a sphere.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:90%
You cannot see the whole thing.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You just can't look
into one part of it.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.950 align:middle line:84%
The perspective of that
truth changed from where

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing that truth.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So every one of us had
to know many, at least 12

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
of those perspectives, so
we could have the whole.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But we knew that we
should not go and take

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
every dimension for
ourselves and to go and look

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
for every perspective for
ourselves, that we had to do

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
was to center in our own
reality and perspective,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:84%
knowing that every
one of them was true.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we go out
of our perspective,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
then one of the parts
would be missed.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning of
the civilization,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:84%
we were taught that our
goal was to go to the stars.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
What we, as humanity, are now,
we are looking to the heavens

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:90%
since thousands of years ago.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And we are saying, the
stars are our goal.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And we have to go there.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look for
life in other planets.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:90%
And we have to go farther.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, when we start
to understand the dimensions,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
we understood that the
only dimension that exists

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
is the first one, that the first
one holds all the realities

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
and every perspective.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is just a
spot in the core of the sphere.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So we realized that going
out to look for that truth

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:90%
was not the goal.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
The goal was to go in
the core of the planet.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And there, we could see every
perspective from one spot.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So our goal in the reality
was to live every dimension,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:84%
but not to go to
those dimensions,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
but to understand
that them all are just

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.005 align:middle line:84%
perspective of the first
one, which is unity.

00:11:23.005 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:90%
First dimension is mind.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:90%
First dimension is the thoughts.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing but
consciousness in the universe.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
thing that exists.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Mind is the only spot from
where every perspective is

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:90%
projected in the universe.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing else but mind.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And the waves that the
thinking, the thoughts

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
are doing in the universe
creates this oceans

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:84%
of thinkings that then
we call time and space

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:90%
and every other dimension.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:90%
But unity was not created.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Unity is itself constant and
the only thing that exists.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just a projection
of the self, of just one being.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And that one being--

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
you may call it
God or whatever--

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I call it the consciousness--
we are all in that consciousness

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and living the
different perspective

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:90%
of that consciousness.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So unity is the only place
from where we come from

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and where we go to.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why every
being in the universe

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
is telling us to go to unity,
to remember that we are one.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that we, as humanity,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.130 align:middle line:90%
are trying to understand now.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really
know what exactly

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:84%
mean to be one, because
we think that being one

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:90%
is to be together.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
And everyone think the same.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And everyone would be happy
and all in peace and harmony.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It's to remember
that we are just

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
holograms of the reality,
which is one spot

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and that there is no
other reality but one.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So the beginning of
the first dimension

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:84%
is when the only consciousness
existent in the universe

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:90%
made a question.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:84%
The question started from one
certain thing, certain through.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.100 align:middle line:90%
That was I Am.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
consciousness knew

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:90%
was that it was only one.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was called I Am.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So the universe was created
from the self, from the one.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, then I Am asked
itself, who I can become.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So there was the
beginning of everything,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
but not the matter, not
the galaxies, just the idea

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:90%
of being someone else.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the time, where
time doesn't exist.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
There was no possibility to
say it happened some years ago.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to say so,
because there was no time.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:90%
There was not space.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
When you try to
think about unity,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the only way you can
achieve that goal to feel it

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
or to think about
it is in your mind.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
In your imagination is the
only way you can achieve unity.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
There is no way you can do it
through the third dimension.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can go
through it is through mind.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:50.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we start
to practice the unity

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and we have to go to
the very beginning,

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:84%
we have to go
through every idea we

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
have about reality, because
every reality is just

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:90%
a thinking.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's not the real truth.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way to compare
the beginning with anything

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:90%
you possibly know.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why every
being in this planet

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and other planets that we're
told how to go to the unity--

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
that they had to do

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
was unlearn everything
they've learned in their life.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:90%
So you have to forget.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the only way.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can remember
is if you forget everything

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.910 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we call the void.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:90%
That's an emptiness.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And you just start to see
that there is nothing.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, when you finally
see that darkness and the void

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:84%
is the only place where you
could possibly see everything

00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
within, so you will
understand that the beginning

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
of the first dimension--
it was not something

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:90%
that you could see.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that you could feel.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Feeling is the only way you can
understand the first dimension.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's so, so many feelings
that we call neutrality.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like you can feel so
many things that suddenly you

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.880 align:middle line:90%
can't feel anything.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And you just are like
floating in the universe

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and nothingness.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
the first dimension

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
is just what you project as
an idea, as an imagination.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can
understand the first dimension

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
is if you go back
to your childhood

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and remember that you could
imagine whatever you possibly

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:90%
could imagine.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And you are free from
every experience you have.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you can travel
through time and space,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
from being in just one spot.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So the beginning of
everything is not a light,

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:90%
is not an electron.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a thinking, a thought
that starts to wave around.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And you just start to feel
it, like waving, thinking.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this waves start
to make a sound, the vibration.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And this movement
start to sound like a--

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
[HUMMING]

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And this low vibration
started to go

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:90%
higher and higher and higher.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, in every
mix start to sing.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like a-- the
most beautiful song

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
you could ever
possibly think about.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you could
feel in the first dimension.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why unity
is not something

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that we are going to live as
a real thing in this planet.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
The reality of this
universe is that there

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
is no time and no space,
because everything is just one.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:90%
There is no split in times.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
There is no split
in perspectives.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:90%
There is no split in space.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why unity is
the only state, where

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:84%
you could feel everything,
where you could see everything,

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:90%
where you could be anywhere.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, for us, was the
spot where we could learn

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:90%
how to go back to the unity.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:10%
We used to call Sirius In-Na.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.570 align:middle line:10%
That's the name we have
for the two stars--

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:10%
the bigger one, In,
and the small one, Na--

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:10%
In-Na.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:10%
We were called the In-Na people.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And the In-Na people
has this story.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
At the first beginning,
there was nothing.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:90%
There was a void.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And from that void, there was
a breathe, a breathing that

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:90%
starts to create every reality.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
By that breathing, a door
was open in the universe,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:90%
the door of the self.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And the self went through
every time and every space.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
We call that the M, the
portal, the H, the time,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:90%
and the S, the space.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So the name for the
universe for us was MAHAS.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
MAHAS Was the creation,
was the consciousness going

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
from this unity
towards everything,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:90%
towards every dimension.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we realized
that, where does it go?

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And what is the limit of that?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But we realized that
it was limitless.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:90%
There was not end.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:90%
There was no purpose.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So the only purpose
that we had was

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand
every space, to understand

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
every time, and then bring them
all to the portal to the self

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And we call that the SHM, SAHAM.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We used to call the universe
as the process MAHAS SAHAM.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:84%
MAHAS SAHAM was the
name of God for us.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But we knew that
God was not outside.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:90%
It was everything.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So the goal of everything was to
go through every time and space

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:84%
possibly talking and possibly
living in the whole of reality,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and then bring them
all again to the self.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So the whole process
of the universe

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
was to go from the self,
the first dimension, split

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:90%
in many other dimensions.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Those other dimensions
start to split

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:84%
like flowers in the
universe, creating

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:84%
this big network
of consciousness

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
around, like a very big-- the
biggest mind you could possibly

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:84%
imagine in the universe,
create in every reality.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
had accomplished

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to live every possible reality,
you go back to the self

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and says to the self, I did it.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Now, I know what I could become.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So for the universe, for
the story of In-Na people,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:35.600 align:middle line:84%
we used to say there was
no purpose but to remember

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:90%
who we are.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Or there is no purpose.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But go and see what
we are capable of.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just like this trip
that the hero in the stories

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:90%
used to take--

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:57.230 align:middle line:84%
going out of your home, go
through all these adventures.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Believe in yourself.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Try to understand
who you can become.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, go back to your
home to tell the story of what

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
you have become.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
For us, there was no
goal in the universe.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
For us, the only goal
was to know ourselves

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.750 align:middle line:84%
as in many possible
dimensions we could.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We knew that the whole universe
was in the perfect balance.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But also when it
become aware of itself,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
the universe and
the civilizations

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
around the universe
start to realize

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that they were trapped
in a kind of a network,

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that they could not go
out from that, that we

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
were trapped in this matrix.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So we In-Na people and other
beings in other planets

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
realized that there is no
one that created this matrix

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
for you, that you walking and
going through the thinkings

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.500 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, the
thoughts of this Great Mind--

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:90%
you were waving the universe.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, when you
had this whole movement

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:84%
around this fear of reality,
you stopped being a spider

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and become a fly
trapped in the reality.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how
to go back and how

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to go out of this reality.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of things start
to fight against it,

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.590 align:middle line:84%
start to fight to go
out of this matrix.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of wars start,
because every perspective

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
was thinking about a different
way in which the reality was

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:90%
created.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So some of them
start to believe, OK.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:84%
If we kill every one
of them, maybe we

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:84%
can find a way to
go to the unity,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
another perspectives.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So a big war started
in many dimensions

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:90%
to control the matrix.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.140 align:middle line:90%
But we were all trapped in that.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We, as In-Na, as a
mind civilization--

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
we designed this
plan in which we

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
could teach every
civilization in every planet

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
how to work on the network, how
to understand how we created

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:84%
the network, and how to
go through the network

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and become, again, a spider.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
If you realized that you
can transform and create

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
your own reality, so you will
know that there is no escape.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:90%
There is no place to go.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
There is no way out
of this reality,

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
but going to the first dimension
and to realize that you

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.160 align:middle line:90%
created every one of them.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the importance
why we civilizations

00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:84%
in other planets used to
go through every dimension.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But the only way
we could possibly

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:90%
come here to teach this--

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.325 align:middle line:84%
it was through the
fourth dimension.

00:25:09.325 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth
dimension is time.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:90%
So I lived in the past.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:90%
But I was working in the future.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why it is important to
understand every dimension,

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
because the only way you
can go back to yourself

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and to realize the perfection
of what you have created

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is if you understand
every perspective that you

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:90%
have created.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:90%
