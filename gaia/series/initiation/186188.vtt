00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What does the ninth dimension
tell us about ourselves?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I am MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
are going to learn

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:84%
about how the
universe sees itself

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and how that plays
into creation.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.980 align:middle line:84%
At the moment that the whole
universe take consciousness

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
about itself, you
start to realize

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that the last dimension
that appears in the universe

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.616 align:middle line:84%
is the one that we
used to call God.

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just the last one.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:90%
It also the first one.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
The first dimension is the one
when the consciousness realize

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that the only thing that
they have is the mind.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Mind is the only thing that
exists in the first dimension--

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.445 align:middle line:90%
the idea, the dream.

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So at the first dimension
when the being realize

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
who he is, is when the
first dimension says,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I know who I am.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
"I am" is the most important
statement in the universe.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:90%
It's the only thing that exists.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.530 align:middle line:90%
I am everything.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I am all.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:90%
I am nothing.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And I am void.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.965 align:middle line:90%
And I am everything.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So in this moment when
it realize about himself,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:84%
start to wonder,
what could I become?

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:10%
So it becomes the
second dimension.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:10%
The second dimension will
show what the being had within

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.330 align:middle line:10%
to see it outside.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Then this being
start to ask himself,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
what could I do with
these new questions?

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
What could I do
with this reflection

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:90%
I am having about myself?

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So it start to create
the third dimension.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The third dimensional
beings are the ones

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that will experience those
separations, statements

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:90%
of the universe-- who I am.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:90%
What could I become?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.685 align:middle line:90%
Who I become?

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:84%
In the third dimension,
the mind of the universe

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:90%
can experience what it has--

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:90%
think about himself.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment that the
third dimension is created,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
the second dimension start
to split and multiply by 2.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.755 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes the
fourth dimension.

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
will be the time

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
in which the space in the
third dimension will leave.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth dimension
will allow the being

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
to understand himself in many
different perspective of time.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:10%
Once we have done the path of
expression-- experimentation,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.390 align:middle line:10%
integration, and
transcendence-- fourth dimension

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:10%
start to become the
fifth dimension.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension will show
you the light, the clarity

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
of the whole process.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And by polarity, we create
the sixth dimension.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth
dimension will allow

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
you to create new realities
in time and space,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.395 align:middle line:84%
to be the alchemist
of time and space.

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
When both positive
and negative start

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to realize about everything,
and every dimension,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and every possibility
you have, you

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:84%
will become the
seventh dimension.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Seventh dimension will hold
the seven Laws of the Universe

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that will help the coherence
during every dimension

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.925 align:middle line:90%
of the whole universe.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So seventh dimension
is the place

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
where you will have the
glory, like the heaven, where

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you can feel and
understand everything that

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen,
everything that happened,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and everything that is
happening right now.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why from the
seventh dimension--

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
start to become the
eighth dimension, which

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
is the network of
consciousness of the universe.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So you could see it
like a big library when

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
you have all information,
every record of every being,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.270 align:middle line:84%
every existence in every
dimension in every time

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:90%
and every space.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have this torus
around, creating this energy

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:84%
through time and space,
looking into many directions

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:90%
the realities of the being.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all these
realities of consciousness

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
come back to the
core to the center.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And you see a black hole.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
This black hole is
not light anymore.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
The light came from
the very beginning,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
when the positive
and negative start

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to go around the universe,
when the positive and negative

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
creates the energy
to make light.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But the ninth
dimension is not light.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a black hole where
everything is contained, where

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:90%
everything can be transcendent.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call this
the dimension of God,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
the dimension of the
reality, the real reality.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.320 align:middle line:84%
The truth is where
there is no place to go.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to see.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But it is kind of
a unity in which

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you as a whole being as God
just realize who you can become.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So the whole experience,
and all integration,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and every expression that
you got in the universe--

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:90%
it's being transcended.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:84%
That means the
ninth dimension is

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
the one that let be everything.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:90%
That let it go.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't hold all the
reality that he has created.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:90%
There is no possession.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:90%
There is no "I."

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no "me."

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:90%
So everything goes to the void.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The ninth dimension
is the void from where

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
you can create everything
again in another perspective,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension,
in a new universe.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
As we said, the first
dimension is the expression

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.950 align:middle line:90%
of the universe from the mind.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension
will be the dimension

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
where the being realize about
experience from time and space.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why the fifth dimension
is the master dimension where

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:90%
you could see every experience.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And you could understand
every experience you have.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:10%
Then you will have
the seventh dimension,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:10%
which is the integration of
everything you have created.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The seventh dimension
is the place

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
where every law and everything
that you have created

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth and
the fifth dimension

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.685 align:middle line:84%
is aligned in just one
being, so integration.

00:07:03.685 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the ninth dimension,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
which is transcendence of the
whole process of the universe.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Our cultural way
of thinking-- we

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
used to believe that going to
God is like going to the light.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment you
reach the dimension of God,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
you will find only void,
only this shadow that allows

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
you to brighten by yourself.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So God doesn't have
any perspective.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:90%
God doesn't have any dimension.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
God is everything, or the
goddess is everything.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
positive and negative.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
We call it, "it," or the void.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So is the place
where-- is the place

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and the time where there
is no place, no time, where

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And you can create from
the very beginning,

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
from the new idea you
have about a new universe.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
ninth dimension is

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:90%
the most important dimension.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Because when you forget
about yourself, when

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
there is no me, then
there is no us, when

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.160 align:middle line:84%
there is nothing
around, nothing within,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
when everything is kind of
a piece where you could find

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
every possibility in every
spot of the universe,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:90%
we call this also the prodicta.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
Prodicta was a name
that Atlanteans beings

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
used to refer to
the ninth dimension.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This was the shape of a
cross made up with 33 cubes.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:84%
These cubes were created
in the ninth dimensions,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
once and again
multiplying itself

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in the shape of a chakana.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Chakana is the star
of the Andes people.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Andean people have these
stairs to heaven and stairs

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
to the core of the Earth
with the sphere in the core,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.320 align:middle line:90%
in the center.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So you could have these
stairs above and below,

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:90%
right and left.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.250 align:middle line:10%
And you could see
this projection

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:10%
of every process on
the fourth dimension,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:10%
and the fifth dimension,
and the third dimension, all

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:10%
in one reality.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:10%
So when you start to multiply
in many, many spaces and times,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:10%
this shape of the chakana--

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:10%
you will find these cubes of
reality that creates a sphere.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:10%
These cubes of reality
are the technology

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:10%
towards the ninth dimension.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Many beings in
this planet realize

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
that the whole world
we are living in

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:90%
is like a big prodicta.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we know how to go to the
third dimension in every one

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of the spots of this
network of the prodicta,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
we could find the
ways and the portals

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:84%
through the sixth dimension to
go to the core of the prodicta

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and change every
reality, like if it were

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.135 align:middle line:90%
mirrors looking into the sun.

00:10:24.135 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you change
all these mirrors,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.290 align:middle line:84%
you can switch the
third dimension

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
towards the sixth
dimension, going

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to the core in the
ninth dimension.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's why for
ancient people,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.300 align:middle line:84%
we call every path,
every teach that we

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
had in this planet like
initiatic path to--

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.116 align:middle line:84%
made men and women
become god and goddess.

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%
The path towards the divine--

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
it was to realize that us as
matter in the third dimension--

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
we're able to turn--
form ourselves.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
do it is through the void

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.640 align:middle line:90%
of the ninth dimension.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.895 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
important to meditate.

00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's important
to find the void within,

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
to find the void in
matter, the void in soul,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
in emotions, the
void in your mind.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
When you accomplish the blank,
when you accomplish the void,

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and you just realize that
you cannot feel anything,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%
you cannot feel by emotions,
you cannot feel by body,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
you cannot feel your
mind, that you simply are,

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.010 align:middle line:84%
that there is nothing out,
nothing in, that your body is

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
just a projection from
the first dimension.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And that your mind is
the only thing that

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:90%
sprays all over the universe.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot even see it,
because everything is like

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
a big shadow or darkness that
is so deep and so peaceful.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is the moment
when you are connected

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.605 align:middle line:90%
with the ninth dimension.

00:12:08.605 --> 00:12:12.140 align:middle line:84%
The ninth dimension doesn't
hold every dimension.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the eighth dimension.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:90%
God is not holding anything.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:90%
God is not even consciousness.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
God is the void that
allows the consciousness

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of itself and to
create new universe by freedom.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.722 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:29.722 --> 00:12:32.207 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.207 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We are multi-dimensional
beings being

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
created in different levels
through the first, the fifth,

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
the seventh dimension, then
the second, the fourth,

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
the eighth dimension, and
then the third, the sixth,

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and the ninth dimension.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So this group of
three are the ones

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to understand that
the dimensions are relative.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the trinity
of the first dimension,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
you will realize that
the first dimension

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:90%
is the consciousness itself.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.845 align:middle line:84%
And this consciousness allows
the higher consciousness

00:13:14.845 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth dimension to
see the process of everything

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.725 align:middle line:90%
that the first one will express.

00:13:20.725 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And then the seventh dimension
is the highest vibration

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:84%
of all that, that connect the
whole process through the loss

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.390 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So first, fifth, and seventh
dimension will be the three--

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:42.115 align:middle line:84%
the trinity to understand the
consciousness of the being.

00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Then the second
dimension will multiply

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth and the eight.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The second dimension will
be the positive and negative

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:90%
to see the outside.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So the fourth dimension will
bring you the process of time

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
in which you can see every
positive and negative,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
every mirror of
the time, and then

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
through the eighth dimension,
understand the whole process

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of
every single time

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
that you have created
in the universe

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to see yourself from many
different directions.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's the trinity of time--

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:90%
two, four, and eight.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the trinity of matter

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and the trinity of creation.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.570 align:middle line:84%
The trinity of creation
is 3, 6, and 9.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
We as human beings are
in the third dimension.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
This third dimension
is a structure

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.860 align:middle line:84%
in between past,
present, future.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And we are conditioned by
these times and these spaces.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:10%
But then you have to
multiply the third dimension.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And you will have
the sixth dimension.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.440 align:middle line:84%
When you find the
sixth dimension,

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:84%
you will know that you
can transform your past.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:90%
You can transform your present.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:90%
You can transform your future.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:84%
The three of them
just in one reality.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:10%
You become like an alchemist
in the sixth dimension

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:10%
to transform this reality
in the third dimension.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
the ninth dimension.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
The ninth dimension
will show you

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.777 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of the whole
process of experimentation--

00:15:29.777 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:90%
the third dimension.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are so connected
with the ninth dimension that

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
help us to understand
why we are here.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
need the image of God

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:84%
or someone that helps us to
understand why we are here.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
straight connected

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:90%
to the ninth dimension.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
problem that people

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
in the second, in the fourth,
in the eighth dimension,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:90%
or seventh dimension have.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:01.030 align:middle line:84%
These are not problems that are
wondered in those dimensions.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Only beings in the third
and the sixth dimension

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
are asking and feel
the presence of God.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Because we are exactly
the projection of that

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
divine here in matter.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
As the second, the fourth,
and the eighth dimension

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
are the trinity
towards time and space

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and the energy that
flows in between time,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
the third dimension,
the sixth dimension,

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and the ninth
dimension will allow

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.040 align:middle line:84%
us to go through
every time and space

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and unite them all in just one
reality, which is the void.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Everything is in
the third dimension.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The void is in the
ninth dimension.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth dimension is the
bridge in between both of them

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
that help us realize that the
only way you can transform

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
the reality in the
third dimension

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is if you become void
to create new realities.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why three, six, and
nine are so important for us

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:90%
to understand that--

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.200 align:middle line:84%
are the key to
transform every reality.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So everyone kind of know
inside the importance

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:90%
of those numbers.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
We order these
dimensions in numbers

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.660 align:middle line:90%
from the one to the ninth.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to organize
the separation of things,

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.970 align:middle line:84%
because we are in
the third dimension.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, the
ninth dimensions

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
are not specific order by
numbers, but by geometry.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
So by geometry,
we can understand

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:10%
that the third dimension is
the structure of time and space

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:10%
to being lived here
and is the dimension

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:10%
where the trinity
of the universe

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:09.615 align:middle line:10%
has created a being that we
call spirit, soul, and body.

00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:10%
That's why in the
third dimension--

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:10%
is the only dimension
where you can actually live

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:10%
the three of them in just one.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:84%
That's why the three
is so important.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Because it's our mind,
our emotion, and our will,

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.430 align:middle line:10%
our action altogether
in just one being.

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:10%
This being have to
look for the coherence

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:10%
in between the three of them.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when in our
lives are asked to be coherent,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
we will start to see the three
in every moment of our lives.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
The three start to repeat
itself once and again--

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:90%
3, 3, 3, 3.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to call
ourselves to be connected

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
to the trinity of ourselves,
to be coherent with ourselves.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:84%
That's why, also,
in the past, they

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
did this path of recognition
of the whole being

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
as different ways in which
you should understand

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:84%
every stage of the universe till
you can transform the universe.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why some orders had
this great 33, or the age where

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Jesus was transcendent, the 33.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
33 is just a code in which
someone from the matter

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
realize how to transform
itself through the matter.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So these numbers are
calling us all the time

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
to remember us, that we have
to become gods on earth.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it was so
important for some masters

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.740 align:middle line:84%
to die at the 33, or
to transcend at the 33,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:90%
or to teach at the 33.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Because it's just a code.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not a number per se.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.695 align:middle line:84%
It's a code in between one
trinity, which is negative

00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
and the other trinity,
which is positive.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
When they just connect, you
have what we call the merkaba.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The merkaba start
to turn the energy

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.120 align:middle line:84%
from positive and
negative, creating

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
these tetrahedrons of trinity,
like the wheels of creation

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
of the being.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And once you have this creation,
you realize about the sixth.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:90%
The sixth is real important.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the one
that moves realities.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:90%
That's why 66--

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:84%
666 used to be the
numbers of transformation.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened with this number?

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people is
scared about the six,

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:90%
because the six means death.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:90%
The six means the destruction.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Because to be another
being, you have

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
to destroy what you have become.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to forget who you are
in order to be another being.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to let go every
reality you have created

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.360 align:middle line:84%
or you have lived in
to be another being.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's why a
lot of people used

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
to say that in order to
be safe in this reality

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and to be happy in
this reality, you

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:90%
should fear the numbers 666.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
You should fear the six, because
is the number that will change

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
your life, is the number
that will make you die

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
or that will transform
yourself in such a way

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.035 align:middle line:84%
that you will forget
about yourself.

00:21:42.035 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So according to this,
the sixth dimension

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
is just the one that
enlights yourself

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:90%
to be your own creator.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why through
the story and history,

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:84%
we had all these people that
they didn't want you to realize

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that you were able to
contact the energy of God

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, to transform
your own reality.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why they made you
fear about the number six.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you will find
the nine, which also

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.250 align:middle line:90%
can be repeated in 99 or 999.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is the number of God.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a number of the
whole and is the number

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of the transcendence
of every reality

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:90%
that you have created before.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are so bonded
and connected to these three

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:90%
numbers.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:10%
Because we are the trinity that
are meant to go to the divine.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Our religions create
this idea of someone

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
or of something that
is bigger than us,

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
since thousands of
years ago, we had

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge within
that we were heading

00:22:55.250 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
towards some special spot in
the universe where God allow--

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.020 align:middle line:84%
or whoever you want
to call it, exist,

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:84%
because is the place
where you are meant to go.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So even the smallest human
being in this planet kind of

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:84%
know that there exists
something above, or in, or out,

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
or inside that is much powerful
than we are and we call God.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's not outside,
neither within.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just the construction
of every reality

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:90%
outside and within.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we say
it's bigger than us,

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
it's not because we are smaller.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It's because we are just
a projection of himself.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot see the whole
picture that the reality

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.560 align:middle line:90%
of the ninth dimension can see.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, we have
this idea of something

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
bigger than ourselves, something
that holds the whole universe.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But in order to get there, we
have to forget the universe.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
We have to forget what we
believe of the universe.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
important for you

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:84%
to know what is the
ninth dimension.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Because at the moment you
will find yourself in front

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
of the ninth dimension, it's
possible that you cannot feel

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:90%
You cannot feel joy.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
You cannot feel
anything in your body.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:90%
You cannot feel any thought.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:90%
You will be just nothing.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:90%
And people fear nothing.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Fear.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Void.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Fear the shadow, because
it's totally opposite to what

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:90%
we were taught about God.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:84%
What is amazing about
the ninth dimension

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is exactly that, that when
you go to the ninth dimension,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and when you feel
the ninth dimension,

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, you feel all
that void and emptiness.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And you just feel
that there's nothing.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:90%
Nothing exists.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
There is only one thing
that you could do,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that you will realize
that you are thinking.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And that the only
thing that exists there

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
is your thought
of, what is this?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And who am I?

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the goal of
the ninth dimension,

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the only
thinking in the universe

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:90%
is you.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's God when you realize
that the only creator that

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:84%
exists is just one,
and you are it.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:90%
