00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the statements
of the universe?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:10%
I am your host,
Matias De Stefano.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
learn about the statements

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:10%
of the universe and define
creation from these statements.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The statements of the universe
are three specific in which

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:90%
every reality moves through.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
First one must be love,
the second one, wisdom.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:90%
And the third one is will.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
These three tools that
we have in the universe

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:84%
allows us to understand the
universe from very different

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:90%
perspectives.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:10%
And once you have this
three perspectives,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:10%
you have to understand
that the whole process has

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.780 align:middle line:10%
the statement of evolution.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And that has the
goal of co-creation.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
These five statements are the
basis of the fifth dimension.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is
born in the same moment

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that the first
dimension was born.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The first dimension
was born from the idea

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that this being
has about itself.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
But this idea has
love to be expressed;

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
has wisdom to understand
who it is, who it was,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and who it will be; and has
will to move and create;

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
and also have this idea of
living a process of four

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
statements that we call in
the whole row, like evolution.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And once you accomplished
the evolution

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.100 align:middle line:84%
of every stages of the
universe, you are a co-creator.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.750 align:middle line:84%
You are able to become
not only a creation,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:90%
but also a creator itself.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
The fifth dimension is the
one, where the wise ones, those

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
who has accomplished
the experience

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:84%
of the third dimension,
can watch the expression,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
can watch the whole process
of the fourth dimension

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
and understand why.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of it?

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.517 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
is a lot of people

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that says that in
the fifth dimension,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.290 align:middle line:84%
we have the masters,
the guides--

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
the people and beings,
who are heading us

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.050 align:middle line:84%
in our mission, who are leading
us in our purpose on life and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.420 align:middle line:84%
are those who speak
to our ears and says

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
what is good, what
is bad, where to go,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
where not to go, what
to do, what not to do.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Those people that
hear themselves

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth
dimension are the ones

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that channel the
information from the whole,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that have
the whole picture.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Fifth dimension is a dimension
of the core of the universe.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
You have four dimensions in
which you can see yourself--

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
the first dimension,
the fifth dimension,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
the seventh dimension,
and the ninth dimension.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
All this process
of this four states

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
have this first dimension
as an expression,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
the fifth dimension as
the experimentation,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the seventh dimension
like integration,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and the ninth dimension the
transcendence of the process.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So fifth dimension is
related to the third one,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because fifth dimension
is the one that

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand
the process we

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
live in the third and
the fourth dimension.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why the beings
in the fifth dimension

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.440 align:middle line:90%
guide us in the third dimension.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And as we do our lives and
as we express our realities

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.510 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension as human
beings or plants or as animals,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:90%
minerals-- whatever--

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, we help
the people from fifth dimension

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to understand their selves
through that experience.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So we used to
believe that beings

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth, the fifth,
the sixth dimension

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
are people or beings that
are more evolved than we are.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:84%
In between dimensions, what we
do is to learn from each other.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So as we do experimentation
in the third dimension,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
the fifth dimension help us
to see the whole picture.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But we, as we experience and
as we see the whole picture,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.700 align:middle line:84%
we help them to feel the
emotions of those expressions.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we
are like a symbiotic

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:90%
being all around the universe.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions are
like different organs

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:90%
in the body of the universe.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And all of them has
a purpose to do,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
but all together are able to
help the being to be alive

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:90%
and to evolve.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So every being in
the whole universe

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:84%
has to find their way into the
fifth dimension with this five

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:90%
statements.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:90%
The first statement is love.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Love means eternity.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Love is not something
you feel for others.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The love is the main vibration
that allows the being

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:90%
to express itself.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you connect to
the love of the universe,

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:90%
you won't feel any emotion.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
You will feel every
emotion in just one spot,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:90%
in just one moment.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are just the
waves from that love.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can express love in
different levels of vibration.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why we used to say that
the opposite of love is hate.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Hate is the low
vibration of love,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
because you don't hate
just because you hate.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
You hate, because
you are not loved.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you can
understand every emotion, even

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
the low ones and the high
ones, are through love,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.171 align:middle line:84%
because it is the energy
that creates every emotion.

00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you connect yourself
with the fifth dimension,

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
you have to feel
unconditional love

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:90%
to understand what love means.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Unconditional is that you are
just aware that your self has

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:90%
created everything around.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So love is just the expression
that has created all this.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Dimensions are different ways
of consciousness in which

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:90%
you observe one reality.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
That's why you don't go
to the fifth dimension.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:90%
You achieve fifth dimension.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:90%
You feel fifth dimension.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
feel in coherence

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
from the third dimension,
the unconditional love,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:84%
it will be very difficult to
understand the fifth dimension,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.770 align:middle line:84%
because in the fifth
dimension, love is just one.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It is not separated by chakras
So you cannot hate or love.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
You just love
everything as it is.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why in the
fifth dimension

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist judgment.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:10%
So if you in your heart have
a little bit of judgment

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:10%
for someone or something, so it
will be really difficult to you

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:10%
to see the fifth dimension.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is when you see our
reality from your perspective.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot see
the whole picture.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Fifth dimensions allow you
to see the whole picture

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:90%
in every time and space.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can understand
the process.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
When you see the
whole process and you

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
see that you have
lived everything,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
you achieve the second
statement of the universe,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:90%
which is wisdom.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is not something that
is related with knowledge.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:84%
You are not wise,
because you know stuff.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
You are wise, because
you understand stuff.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's very different.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Understanding is when you
already feel the truth.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And knowledge is when you
have to take information

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
from all over to put
that information together

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
process of a truth.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
In the third
dimension, knowledge

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is good, because you have to
follow and understand and study

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and look in every
book in the internet,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:90%
looking for information.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's good, because
it helps you to understand

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:10%
the reality you have created.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:10%
So it is good to have knowledge.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But when you go and you
feel the fifth dimension,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
you will figure
out that knowledge

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make difference.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.200 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension,
wisdom is what really matters.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is when you
feel the truth,

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:90%
not when you can tell the truth.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
The truth is just one, but split
in so many different levels

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that wisdom allows
you to have doubt.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is the one that
doesn't have certainty,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
because wisdom is
when a being allows

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
himself to live like a kid.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It's surprise about everything,
because feel the information

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and not understand
information, not

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:90%
to-- not think the information.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the second
statement of wisdom

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:84%
helps you to leave the judgment
and see every possibility

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:90%
and see every perspective.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the wise
people don't used to say,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:90%
this is the truth.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Wise peoples used to say, what
is your perspective of truth?

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about this?

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
That's why teachings in the
past were not statements

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:90%
that were taught to people.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.340 align:middle line:84%
The wise people used to
ask to the students what

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
do they think about this.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And the wise beings in
the fifth dimensions

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
ask and not lead,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
are not the ones that
says, you have to go there.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones that
says, are you sure

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:90%
that you are going right?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:90%
That's the wisdom.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom is to
allow the other one

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to see the truth
from their own eyes.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
The third statement
will be will.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:84%
The will is to act,
to have the energy

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
to go through the realities,
to have the force, the strength

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to create realities.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So the fifth dimension
works with will,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.030 align:middle line:84%
because it is the
one that understand

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that love and wisdom
are the statements that

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
helps you to understand
and feel the creation

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and understand
the whole picture.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And will is the one
that gives the energy.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can transform
that whole picture.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Will is the strength
and the engine

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that allows wisdom and
love to be expressed.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And in our lives in
the third dimension,

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
will is the one that
helps us to go through,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to have the power,
the inner power,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we
are capable of anything.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
the fifth dimension,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:84%
we know that we are
capable of anything.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In the third dimension, we are
limited by cultural thoughts,

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
by emotional thoughts,
by biological realities.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So we are limited into
this experimentation.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the fifth dimension,
the ones that have the will

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
will tell you, you--

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I know that you are
capable of everything.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when we go
to the fifth dimension,

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
when we can see the
fifth dimension,

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
we can see that we are
able to do anything.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:10%
And the process of love,
of wisdom, and will

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.650 align:middle line:10%
is ruled by evolution.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Evolution is the
fourth statement

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth dimension.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
They know that the process
that we held in the universe

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%
is evolution--

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:84%
evolution, as science says and
evolution as spirituality says.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
When you put spiritual
beings and spiritual thoughts

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
with the biological
way of living,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:90%
which you have evolution.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.800 align:middle line:84%
We used to separate both,
like if evolution is not

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.510 align:middle line:90%
something spiritual.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But evolution is the
path that the spirits

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:90%
took to understand themselves.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's not something different.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the path that we created
to understand who we are.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
the fifth dimension,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
we can see evolution
as the initiatic path

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
towards ourselves,
towards to recognize

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:90%
what we are capable of.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why anyone
in the universe

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
can escape the
process of evolution.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.470 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most
important statements.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important
goal of the universe.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
The universe doesn't care if
you achieve a goal or not.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:10%
The universe cares if you have
learned stuff doing stuff.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's bring us to the
fifth one, which is co-creation.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:90%
We are creation.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
We have been created by the
mind of the first dimension.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But we are living
all this to evolve

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:90%
ourselves to be also creators.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:10%
When we realize that we are
by ourselves different minds

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:10%
of the first
dimension, we can know

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:10%
that the universe is splitting
in different universe.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And as many of us are
acknowledging this,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
we are getting new universes
around, like if a big-- a big,

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
big being is created
through many and thousands

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:90%
of universes--

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:84%
parallel universes are
beings that realized

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%
that they were also creators.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So we are heading to
that path in which we

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:90%
will experience to be gods.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
In ancient realities, they
don't believe in gods.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe
in beings that were--

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:90%
that created us.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They believed that we all
are part of just one being.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And every being is preparing
itself to be a god itself.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's why lots of ancient
temples used to say these

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:84%
are the temples, where
people come to became gods.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So in the fifth
dimension, co-creation

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
is like the main goal
of the fifth dimension.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Co-creation is to be a
co-creator of the reality.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
As much consciousness
you have, more aware

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you are that you are
creating that reality

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:90%
from your perspective.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a whole
perspective of everything,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
you are able to change that
reality from your perspective.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:90%
So you became a creator.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So co-create is not to
create something for me.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Co-create is to create
with others like one being.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:37.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why we used to use
the word co-creation to--

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
related to the
law of attraction.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:84%
When you want to attract
something to your life

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
and you say, I co-create this.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I co-create this reality.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I am a co-creator,
because I have a new car,

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:90%
because I thought on that car.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Or I thought about this house.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:90%
And I have this house.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:90%
But this is not co-creation.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Co-creation is when
you create stuff

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to share with all the people
or all the beings that

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.550 align:middle line:90%
had created that with you.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So co-creation is not
interest in matter.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:84%
They are interest
in experiences.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:21.829 align:middle line:84%
So the co-creation beings are
not doing stuff to have stuff.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:84%
They are doing stuff to
feel, to express, to share.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why fifth
dimension is the one

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can look from above
every process you have lived.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:10%
That's why in the
fourth dimension,

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:10%
you have this four statements--
expression, experimentation,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:10%
integration, and transcendence.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:10%
So this four are
the square in which

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.840 align:middle line:10%
the process of the
universe is held.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:10%
But if you go up,
you build a pyramid.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fifth point up of
that is the fifth dimension

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
that allow you to
see why you have

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.550 align:middle line:90%
been doing this circle around.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it one that shows you how
you can understand everything?

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
There is a goal, a meaning,
a purpose for everything

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:90%
that is happening.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And there is no bad things
or good things happening.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
To understand the process
of the fifth dimension

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
without judgment, it's good
to explain this story in which

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%
everyone we are connected to.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And we are all now the living
result of the Second World War.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.280 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
most horrible things

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:90%
that happens in our history--

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:90%
in recent history.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We experienced that
history in the '40s.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And now, we are integrating that
history in the 21st century.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Hitler is in the
third dimension is

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:84%
someone that did really
bad things for humanity.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the same story
in the fifth dimension.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension,
we have the guides,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual beings
that knows what

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:84%
the process is in the
third dimension, that

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
can see the whole picture.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And they saw that
we, in humanity,

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:90%
were in a very low vibration.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And we had just 50 years
to go up in vibration

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and change the consciousness
of the whole planet.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But we were so low
and so step by step

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.390 align:middle line:84%
that it would take, like,
200 years to understand

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:35.930 align:middle line:84%
this switch of consciousness,
not just 50 years.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We had this tiny time to
understand the consciousness

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.390 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So we needed something that--

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS FINGERS]

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:90%
--make it quicker.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So in the fifth
dimension, some beings

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:84%
said, we have to understand
that the only way

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to make this
consciousness happen

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
is if we unite humanity in
love, if we unite humanity

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:90%
in freedom.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So how do we do
that in a world that

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.470 align:middle line:84%
is so stuck in the way of
thinking, in the way of acting?

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can do
that is by transforming

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:90%
the matter very quick.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you can
do that in the matter

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.540 align:middle line:84%
when everything is low frequency
is by crashing every reality

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
and transforming it
through a crisis.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
spirits and realities

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth dimension send
people to unite the world.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.400 align:middle line:90%
So what happened next?

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:84%
When the war ended, started
the process of unity--

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the process of United Nations,
the process of human rights--

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
the UN and the whole
world start to rid

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
of slavery and all this
separations of the world--

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that the spread of
information and free them.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things that the
world hadn't before that war,

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:90%
and now we have--

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
all that we have now
is because of what

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:90%
happened at that moment.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the fifth dimension,
the goal was accomplished,

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.120 align:middle line:84%
was uniting the world
in love and freedom.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.362 align:middle line:90%
So they did it.

00:21:24.362 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that in
the third dimension,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:84%
we just see this
process so very, very--

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:84%
in a very short way that you
can only feel what makes you

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
feel the process itself and the
people that made the process.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot see
the whole process.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult for many
people to understand

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are here
now because of what

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:90%
happened there in that moment.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to understand
is the fifth dimension

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have
judgment in history.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:84%
In the fifth dimension, we
can understand that everything

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:90%
that happened has a purpose.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And everything that now
we are is because of what

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:90%
we have done in history.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.280 align:middle line:84%
The closest one was
the Second World War.

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have many and plenty of
examples of that, like in Rome,

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:84%
like in Israel, Middle
East, Egypt, China.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:84%
We have so many explanations
that shows us through history

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that bad things and good
things are not such a thing

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
when you see it from
the fifth dimension.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Fifth dimension is unity.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one eye that
see everything from above

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and understand
the whole process.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you go
to the fifth dimension,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
you are not capable
to blame anyone,

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
because you understand
that every person is just

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the product of a process, a tiny
product of the process, that

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.080 align:middle line:90%
is held by the whole spirit.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot judge the matter.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You must understand the
purpose of transformation.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Transcendence for the universe
has a good way and a bad way

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:90%
to be released.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:27.720 align:middle line:84%
The good way is when you realize
that your reality is stuck.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And you start to transform
your reality into another one.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And the bad way
to do that is when

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:90%
you are stuck in your reality.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.875 align:middle line:84%
But you say, no, no, I
don't want to change.

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you don't
want to change,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
the whole vibration of
your body and your reality

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.290 align:middle line:84%
start to change you by force,
because the main statement

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:84%
of the universe in the fifth
dimension is evolution.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
If you don't change,
so the energy stuck--

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:90%
you get ill.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Or there is a war.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So war and sickness, illness are
just the final product of you

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
don't realizing that
you have to change.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So the world makes
you change by force.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
have to understand

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
that if we want to correct and
rid out of wars and illness,

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to fight
against war by peace.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have to
fight illness by heal,

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:90%
because that's polarity.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.300 align:middle line:10%
War and peace is polarity--

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:10%
always will need peace and
war if you are in polarity.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.990 align:middle line:84%
If you fight war
with peace, peace

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
became war once and again,
once and again, once and again.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:10%
So when you go up and
you see the whole process

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:10%
from the fifth dimension, you
will realize that war and peace

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.890 align:middle line:10%
as just processes that are
held, because you are not

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.980 align:middle line:10%
able to evolve by yourself.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you realize
to be in harmony,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
flow of change in your
own life, peace and war

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:90%
start to disappear.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And you find the middle, which
is called balance and harmony.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's the fifth
dimension-- to live in harmony

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.760 align:middle line:84%
with the process of every
time and every space.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano,

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
for this series on the
creation of the universe.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the
next episode, where

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
we will dive into the
meaning behind the light

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
versus the darkness,
good versus evil,

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:90%
and its place in the universe.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:90%
