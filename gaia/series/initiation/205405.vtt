00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> How did the universe create
religions to find itself?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide Matias de Stefano.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will explore
how different paths brings us

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:10%
to the same truth.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantean times,
the 12 families

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:10%
were like people who we
used to ask for advice.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we had this
circle of people

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
representing the different
workers of the region.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were representing
the spirit of the people.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
We call that the
projections of gods.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So each one of them had
the face of an animal

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:90%
that was related to their work.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in the
times of this connection,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
they start to honor those
animals like if they were gods

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and the priests like if
they were the gods themself.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
That brought the confusion
of a animalistic religion.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And they started to honor
the concepts of the universe

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130 align:middle line:84%
As Djehuty said,
the goal for humans

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:84%
is to become gods
on this planet,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
to become the portals
through time and space

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:90%
in flesh, in blood.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the main
preparation that we had

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
was to create the
patterns within that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:90%
could help us enlight in life.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The purpose was not
to reach the spirit.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It was to allow the spirit
to live in this reality.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So those who were able to
open the doors to the spirit,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to this reality, without
willing to escape this reality

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
were the enlightened
ones, those who

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
were the mirrors for thousands
of people to understand

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that they were sent
here as messengers

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:90%
of this divine on Earth.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
people that accomplished

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:90%
this divine on this planet.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of people
that reached enlightenment

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
people that could

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
live at the same level, the
suffering and the pleasure.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:84%
To be balanced in all this
process of enlightenment,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you needed to put all
the darkness together

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and transcend the darkness
through transfiguration.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And this transfiguration, it
was the code of enlightenment

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
in matter that
people like Krishna,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:90%
like Jesus Christ had connected.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The words that connect them
all with the messengers.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And messengers, the
ones that are here

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
bringing the voice of the
universe, the emissaries,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
were say, like,
Christa or Krish.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
These are the words in
which ancient language

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
would call those who
were sent to show God.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's why many
of the names that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
were used to describe those
who had been enlightened

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:90%
are similar in history.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
When we start to reach
the truth of the universe,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.500 align:middle line:84%
we may ask ourselves which
is the best way, or what

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
is the truth, or
what is the path,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
or why is the method we could
use to get to the truth?

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that
there are so many ways

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
to get to the core
of the universe

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
really connected.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Then there is no one way to
go and to find the truth.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:90%
There is many.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient times, we used
to say that everything is stick

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and connected like a network.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So for us, everything was
weaved by a spider that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
connected every different
path in the universe

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:90%
in the same network.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us to understand
that everything really

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
is connected and there is no
one path towards a core that

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:90%
is more important than others.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
For us, the universe was a womb
that was created in realities.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So the spiders were
related to the feminine.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The feminine aspect
of the universe

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
were these fractions
and rays of reality

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that we related with
the part of the spider.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And the main core,
the black hole,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:84%
was this black
part of the spider.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And the many eyes
that this animal has

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.010 align:middle line:84%
was related to all the
eyes in the stars that

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
could see us from above.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So the main image
of this spider,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:84%
even if it's a little
bit scary, the spider

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.730 align:middle line:84%
was not something seen
like something bad.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It was seen like these shadows
of reality that are hidden,

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
the precious seed of reality
covered by this scary face

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:90%
so nobody could touch it.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you want
to protect the most

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:84%
holy shape of the universe,
what we understood

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to cover
it with a horrible face

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
so we don't touch it unless
we recognize that it is

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
just a shape taking care of
something really enlightened

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why for
ancient people,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
all the shapes that maybe we
fear today and that scare us,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
for them was just
the shapes that

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:84%
were taking care of the
main information, wisdom

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
spider, for us,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
was the code that
connects us all.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And we call those beings
the spiders of the galaxy,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:90%
the spiders of the universe.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why for women,
it was important to learn

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.390 align:middle line:84%
how to weave because when they
were weaving the silk, when

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
they were weaving
the clothes, they

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:84%
would put all the patterns of
reality of the universe hidden

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and shown in the structures
that they were using daily.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So they could always
remember that we

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
were created by these spiders,
the mothers of the universe,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
weaving the clothes
that we call now

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.155 align:middle line:90%
the bodies, nature, our planet.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
That is why the most ancient
cultures honor the spider.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And they received the
information from the spiders.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Like the Hopi
people with the ants

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and the spider people that
came from the underground

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and the outer space
that taught them

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
how to weave, how
to conduct, how

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:84%
to connect every
part of the universe

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
through this network of
connections in the mind of God.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We would learn in the
past that the reality was

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
this network, this
spider web that

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
connected the waves of time
and the lines of space crossing

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And we could see that
the space through time

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
would be 12 lines that
connect all the timelines.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we have this
network of time

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.880 align:middle line:84%
going like these waves
in the shape of circles,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the lines that cross those
circles would be 12--

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
six positive and six negative
that crosses all the times.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
shapes or the aspects

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:84%
in which the spider,
the consciousness,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.840 align:middle line:84%
would see everything,
would connect and contact

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
every time and every space.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
aspects of God.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And God was the one
that vibrates the truth.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why the spider
feels the vibration

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of every one of its
aspects surrounding her

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:90%
and surrounding him, it.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why vibration
is the language that

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
connects us all,
because we understood

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:84%
that this cooperation of
the spider with the universe

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
was the accurate way of
understanding how vibration

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
works and connects every
spot in the universe

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:90%
through time and space.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So these 12 would be
the vibrations of it

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:84%
who speaks the truth,
who vibrates the truth.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And that for ancient
languages is the word "El."

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
"El" means the truth
that is spoken.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And because of God
was this truth spoken,

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.180 align:middle line:84%
the verb, the first
vibration, the first singing.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So every aspect would
be an different aspect

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:90%
that was spoken by truth.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:84%
These different aspects we
call now in Hebrew language

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:90%
like the names of archangels.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Archangels means the most
important messengers.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
[GREEK] coming from the
words in Greek meaning

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
"the powerful or
the highest one,"

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and angel, "the messenger."

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So the highest messengers
or the most powerful

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:84%
were the different
aspects in which

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
the word "El" was expressed
in the universe, which

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:90%
were 12 of them.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most known
that we use today

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
was Michael, Uriel,
Gabriel that are

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.600 align:middle line:90%
the vibrations that represent.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Michael, who like God, who like
the truth, the Uriel, the light

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of God, Gabriel,
the strength of God,

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and many others that
represented the positive

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and the negative aspects
of this creation.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:10%
One of the most known that
is related to our thoughts

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:10%
is Raphael.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:10%
Raphael means the physician,
the healing of God.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:10%
And this aspect was
incarnated in everyone

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:10%
that was working with the
body, with the physics,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:10%
with the healing
process of our matter

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:10%
and the third
dimensional realities.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
aspect of Raphael,

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
even today, the physicians has
the symbol of Raphael being

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
the doctor of the
universe and incarnated

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.140 align:middle line:84%
through the image
of Hermes, which

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
was the priest of medicine
in Atlantean times, Djehuty.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So archangels are not
beings with human shape.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
They are aspects that goes
through all the universe

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and that holds the vibration
of the 12 aspects of reality.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So we are all projections
of those archangels.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We are all messengers
of those first 12 spaces

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
that fill the universe.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:84%
In order to live
or let the spirit

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
to come to the world
in flesh and blood,

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you need to open the doors
in the proper harmony.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And to be harmonious, you need
to have the perfect vibration.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is why in your
own blood, in your own DNA,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.420 align:middle line:84%
in the cells, in
every organ, you

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
need to be balanced and
aligned with what you do,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:90%
what you feel, what you think.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And the vibration
to accomplish that

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
was what Djehuty and other
people from ancient Atlantis

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:36.650 align:middle line:84%
taught to reach
through the chantings,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
through the meditation,
through the symbols that were

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:90%
spoken the word of the truth.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And those knowledge were
taught by the Arcturians who

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:84%
were the beings in
the Confederation

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that knew about physics, that
knew about how to transform

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:90%
realities through sound.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is why the
Blue Ones are still

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
alive in those who
accomplished the enlightenment

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
through the vibration of blood
or the vibration in the DNA.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
When a human being
accomplished to open

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
all the portals in matter
to the spirit is what

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:90%
we call enlightenment.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's the moment when you
feel so full of happiness,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:84%
so full of love,
that you could love

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally everything.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
You can feel everything
as a part of you.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You forget of who you are,
and you become everything.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So this process of
enlightenment is

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
when you feel the
highest vibration

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.370 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
When you feel fulfilled
in the third dimension,

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and you are not willing to
leave the third dimension

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
but you are willing
to feel everything

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension
in just one moment,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that connects you
with the transcendence

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:90%
of the third dimension.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the fourth
dimension instantaneously

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
when you recognize that you are
the process of everything that

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.500 align:middle line:84%
happened that is happening
and that will happen.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.520 align:middle line:84%
You can see everything
from every perspective.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
You can see that
you are the one that

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
expressed that experience
that is integrated

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and that transcends
every process.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So time and space
start to be bounded

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and you feel it all
in just here and now.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
concept of eternity.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
When you accomplish
the here and now,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
the four pillars of time and
space start to become just one

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can see them
all from just one spot.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:84%
This is like stop looking
from outside the atom

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:90%
and look the atom from within.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like looking at every
creation surrounding you

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:84%
from the spot that
connects all the realities.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's the fifth dimension.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So in order to go to
the fifth dimension,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:84%
a being shouldn't go
up to the heavens,

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:84%
the being should go deep
into the atom structure

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:30.300 align:middle line:84%
to see the electrons, to see the
light that creates every matter

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:90%
that we are in.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's the enlightenment.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
When all the patterns
of reality are

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
aligned in the same vibration
and everything that was a chaos

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
just shine in the
same perspective.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's like putting all the
colors of the rainbow in just

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:84%
one light again, in one just
structure, which is white.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
This ray of light makes
the enlightenment possible.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can only achieve
that enlightenment

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
through the third dimension
because the only way

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
to see every
perspective and have

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.880 align:middle line:84%
wisdom of that is if you had
experienced every perspective.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why the ascended
masters that we call now

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:84%
from who we receive
information from other levels

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, they are the
spectrum of those people that

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
used to live in the planet
that had accomplished

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:84%
the enlightenment of the whole
process in time and space.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:84%
The ascended masters that
live in the fifth dimension,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
they are not up,
they are within,

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
so deep within that
you can see the light

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.745 align:middle line:84%
of every electron vibrating in
the same pattern of harmony.

00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Fifth dimension is to see
the coherence in everything.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
become masters,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
because they accomplish to
learn everything in the matter.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And now they are able to
teach, to show by experience,

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
by showing their own actions
how it is to be enlightened.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
There are many masters
in the fifth dimension

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
that we relate with
people that were alive,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:90%
like Jesus and Sanat Kumara.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
They are just expressions of the
fifth dimension of the people

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that was alive in
the third dimension.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:84%
They are not
someone or something

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.400 align:middle line:90%
that is higher than us.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They just vibrate
faster than us.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:90%
We live in the past.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
We live in the third
dimension, which

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:84%
is the strongest and
the lowest vibration.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And when the faster
you vibrate, you

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:84%
accomplish to see how electrons
move through time and space.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see all the
realities connected by them.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
the fifth dimension,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:84%
everything is light because you
are seeing everything moving

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:90%
as the same fast as you are.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
can see the future.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
can see everything.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And they can teach us
or show us the best

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:84%
way in which we
could learn about how

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:90%
to live properly in matter.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
In order to become enlightened
beings in the fifth dimension,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
we needed to learn
every step in the third

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and the fourth dimension.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:10%
And that is why the
Ancient Ones created

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.170 align:middle line:10%
the path of enlightenment,
the path of initiation,

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:36.250 align:middle line:10%
in which every school
of knowledge in Europe,

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:10%
in Middle East, in
Africa, in America, they

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:10%
would have to learn everything
of how to live properly

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:10%
in this reality in
the third dimension,

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:10%
so we could transcend our idea
of ourselves through time.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And that would allow us to
get into the information

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.910 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth dimension.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Bringing the fifth dimension,
the spiritual enlightened

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
being, into this
material world was

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
the main goal of
the enlightenment

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
schools, the teaching of how
to become spiritual beings live

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:90%
in this physical experience.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
do that, we needed

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.910 align:middle line:84%
to be recreated once and
again in different levels

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:90%
So we had a purpose.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose was the
masculine aspect.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:90%
We need to go to light.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:90%
We need to go to this goal.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to get
this information.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:10%
So what we had to do
was to go straight

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:10%
to the main information.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And we needed the
gods, the aspect

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.750 align:middle line:84%
of the sun, the aspect of
the teachers, like the goals

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that we had to achieve in every
learning and never teaching,

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and that would be the steps of
evolution that we had created.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But in every step, we needed
to be recreated, reborn again.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So we needed to be born,
experience, and die, reborn,

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
experience, and die.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:84%
This whole process was
a feminine process.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why if we had an
idea of the masculine process

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
of where to go, the feminine
aspect would shape us

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
in different levels of
consciousness trying to show us

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
the different ways
in which we could

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
express the divine on Earth.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why the womb, the
mother, was the most important

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
structure to help
us to transform

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:90%
every idea of ourselves.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We needed to die once and
again to be reborn to see

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%
different aspects.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
codes of the mother,

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:84%
the divine mother on Earth, were
so important for every culture.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were so
many mothers to help

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
us born in different
aspects or different ways.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:90%
We needed to face darkness.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.800 align:middle line:10%
And that's why the priestess
Nephthys would teach us

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:10%
how to go through darkness
and be born into darkness.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Isis,
the mother of light,

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
who would teach us how
to be born in light.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
masters of empower.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:10%
So that's when we found
Sekhmet, the goddess of light

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:10%
of the sun.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:10%
So we need to empower
ourselves, but also

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:10%
to learn about the
sweetness, and the love,

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:10%
and how to take
care of our sons.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:10%
And that was the
image of Hathor.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Then we needed to learn about
the seven laws of the universe.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:10%
And that's the order of
everything, which was Maat.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:10%
Through Maat, Seshat,
the priestess of wisdom,

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.640 align:middle line:10%
would teach us how to go through
each one of those levels.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:84%
The mother of the sky,
the mother of Earth,

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:84%
the mother that we call
Enah, they were teaching us

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
about how we were bounded
in Earth, about the plants,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:84%
about the creation
part of the universe.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is why we needed
to leave and express

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
different ways of mothers in
every stage of our learning

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.580 align:middle line:90%
process in these schools.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
become gods and have

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
a purpose for our creation,
what we needed to do

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
was to become goddesses,
because to create

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:90%
we needed to be the womb.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
We needed to know how to
create within ourselves.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the mother was
so divided in different aspects,

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:84%
so we could learn about all
the different perspectives

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The fertility was
represented by what we

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:90%
call the seed and the flower.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And this aspect of
the feminine was

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Bat, who was the feminine
aspect of fertility

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and the creation
of a new spiritual

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:90%
being being born in reality.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine aspect of
this goddess was Baphomet.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Baphomet was the
shape of a being that

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:84%
united every aspect of
the mothers, and the cows,

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and the sheep that would
represent all the milk

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
there was needed to fertilize
the womb of the mother.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So this being was
taken like the one

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
being able to download
information of the spirit

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness,
into the matter,

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:90%
so the spirit could be born.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:10%
Of course through time,
the shapes of these gods,

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:03.490 align:middle line:10%
when we become to
be monotheistic,

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:10%
these shapes of
fertility start to be

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:10%
like the shape of the demon.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Because for
monotheism, the women

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
were the speakers
with nature, so they

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:84%
were talking with things
that has not relation

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:90%
with God who was in the sky.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So everything that was from
the womb, from the Earth,

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:84%
was connected to underground
with the darkness.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all the
shapes of Bat and Baphomet

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
were taken as the messengers
of the evil, the messengers

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
of the underground,
when they were indeed

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:50.080 align:middle line:84%
the feminine and the
masculine aspects of fertility

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and the doors for the spirit
to come and be born on Earth.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.850 align:middle line:84%
The first schools of
wisdom were trying

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:84%
to teach that all the universe
only spoke one language which

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:07.930 align:middle line:90%
was vibration.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter which name you

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.130 align:middle line:84%
put to any of those
levels of consciousness.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.020 align:middle line:84%
If you are saying
the truth, if you

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
the same stuff,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
about the same
information, so you

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:90%
will reach the core of reality.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So that is why doesn't matter
which name in which culture

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:84%
we call the gods, the Nephilim,
the Elohim, the archangels.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter which
gods we believed in,

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
if it's animalistic,
polytheism, monotheism,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
all the aspects of God are
all connected through time

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and space in the
same connection,

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in the same path,
which is the self

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the core
of reality with the truth.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So from the very
core of the universe

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
to all the network that
was created, every shape,

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
every distortion are just
different shapes and paths

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.950 align:middle line:90%
towards the self.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
in which story,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in which God, in which school
you believe or you follow,

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
you will all arrive
to the same spot.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:31.960 align:middle line:84%
You will all arrive
to the same core which

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:90%
is the I Am, which is the self.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Which is the very
core of every reality

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
is the self expressing itself
in many and different ways.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand the
universe as a big sphere

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and the core, the
main pattern, is

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.180 align:middle line:84%
the one that connects
every spot in the sphere,

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:59.690 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter which
path you take to the core.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:84%
If you go around, if you
go straight to the middle,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
you will cross with many other
perspectives of realities

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.450 align:middle line:84%
or you will not cross any one
going straight to the core.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:90%
But all of them, you have worth.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:84%
All of them are different
shapes of the same reality.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:90%
So there's no true path.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:84%
There's no path
you have to take.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's no one only
truth you have to follow.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to follow
your own truth.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And through the different
schools of learning,

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.970 align:middle line:84%
different ways to understand,
different languages,

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
different perspectives,
all of them

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
will bring you to the
same core of the reality.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So here in planets
like this ones,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:84%
we have to embrace all the
knowledge of every culture,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.190 align:middle line:84%
of every history, of every God,
goddess, priest, priestess,

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
every civilization
because none of them

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.630 align:middle line:90%
are really against each other.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:84%
All of them are just trying to
reach a path towards the core.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And whoever you follow, and even
better if you follow yourself,

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
you will find your own path
towards the core of reality,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.530 align:middle line:90%
to the self, to the I Am.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:25.315 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.315 --> 00:28:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias de Stefano.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.670 align:middle line:84%
how the Sirian people
helped with the mastery

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
of the whole world.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.920 align:middle line:90%
