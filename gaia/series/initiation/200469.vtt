>> How did the Arcturians and
Pleiadians become the first

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:90%
experiments?

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore these two species

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:10%
and how they paved the
way for the creation

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:10%
of homo sapiens sapiens.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
From the point of view
of the sixth dimension,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
they see all the
realities in white.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They can see
everything with light.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So in order to see the
division of creation,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:84%
they need to focus on the spots
where the light shines less.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So they see all the
fractalization of the light,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:90%
and it comes to darkness.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.290 align:middle line:84%
They start to see
small dots of black,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.470 align:middle line:84%
which are like black
holes in the universe.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Those are the portals to go to
the more physical dimensions,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:84%
like the fourth
and the third one.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
These structures
where the other beings

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
can go through and get
into those other dimensions

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:90%
are stars.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The stars are the
main spots where

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.180 align:middle line:84%
all the network
of time and space

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:84%
are bounded into
one specific spot

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and connect all the energy
from the sixth dimension,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
opening a door to the
third and fourth dimension.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the beings
that created the network

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
in the sixth
dimension, they used

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
these star portals to get in.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:10%
And one of the main portals
that they used for our galaxy,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:10%
for our sky, is Pleiades.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And why Pleiades?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Because they are 12 stars that
are aligned with 12 spheres,

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.245 align:middle line:90%
which are the Elohim.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:10%
That's why, through
Pleiades, they

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:10%
found a way in which
each one of them

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:10%
could reach the third dimension.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Plaedian beings
are the physical structure

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:84%
into time and
space of the living

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.280 align:middle line:90%
beings in the sixth dimension.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
system of Pleiades,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
which is in the
Taurus constellation,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
makes everything that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is in the subtle
structure of the universe

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.760 align:middle line:84%
into the material
structure of the universe.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:10%
They are the portal to
bring heaven on earth.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:10%
They are the portal to
bring everything that is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:10%
ethereal to the physical world.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why Pleiades
became the spot

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:84%
where all the high-vibrational
beings in other realities,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
like sixth dimension
and fifth dimension,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
were able to talk
with every being

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth and the third
dimension-- through Pleiades.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.780 align:middle line:84%
In mythology, they
say that Bootes

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:84%
is this big guy
that is taking care

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
of all the cows and the bulls.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And the constellation of Taurus,
the big bull where Pleiades is,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
is taken care by
this big man that

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
is aware of the
importance of this bull.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So the main star is Arcturus.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And Arcturus is
the one that takes

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
care of all information
that, from Pleiades, has

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:90%
come into the third dimension.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So the beings in
Arcturus are the ones

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that put in matter everything
that Plaedians say.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When Plaedians talk
with other dimensions

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and are able to bring the
information from the highest

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
level of beings in the
fifth and sixth dimension,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
they bring that information
to Bootes, to Arcturus.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And they know how to put
that information into cells,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.925 align:middle line:90%
into blood, into DNA.

00:04:44.925 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that you can
relate to Pleiades that you

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
can see is the big portal
that, thousands of years

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:90%
ago, we created in China.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
That region there was one
of the portals to the self,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
to the inner core of
the being, the plexus.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, when
they started to create

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
the whole pattern of the
stars around the planet,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
they chose China to put
the stars of Pleiades.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:10%
Because it's in the correct
side of the portal of Orion,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:10%
which is in Egypt, and then
a series in Peru, Bolivia.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:10%
So this alignment is
the most important thing

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:10%
that you can physically
see of Pleiades

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:10%
being one of the biggest
portals in our planet.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:10%
But historically, Pleiades is
more attached to the heart.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Because most ancient beings
in humans, in the Middle East,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
they used to know
them like the mothers,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:90%
the mothers of creation--

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Hathor, as we call it.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And this goddess
meant life and love.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:10%
That's why all the information
that came from those stars

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:10%
has to be related
to the heart chakra,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:10%
to the love that a mother
gives, and feeds the sons

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:10%
and daughters from
the whole of creation.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the
Middle East kind of

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
were related to
Pleiades in that sense,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that they were
the mothers that connect us

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with the creation and
with the consciousness

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:90%
of the network of the universe.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Plaedians are closer
to the fifth dimension

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.240 align:middle line:90%
than even the fourth dimension.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They are the most
spiritual beings

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
creation and connected

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to the information of who we are
as realities, as living beings.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So they live kind
of out of time.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:10%
And they connect sometimes with
the three-dimensional worlds

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:10%
in Arcturus and Lyra
and other species trying

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:10%
to tell and guide and lead what
the universe is saying for us,

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:10%
for the civilizations
in the matter.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose of
Plaedian people

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
is like being those high masters
and guides in the matter that

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:84%
tells us why we
are here and what

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
we can do to improve ourselves
what we can do to enlighten

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, to
understand reality,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
how we can transform matter
and time in every reality

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.660 align:middle line:90%
that we have created.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So they are the guides of the
spiritual world in the material

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.470 align:middle line:90%
worlds.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Arcturian people are the
ones taking care of the matter,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.860 align:middle line:90%
of the structures.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
They are like the doctors and
the scientists of the galaxy.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
trying to bring

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
all this enlightened
concepts of spiral,

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the importance
of these spiritual patterns

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
into the physical ones,
and put them all together.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:10%
So they discovered how
spirituality moves through DNA,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:10%
through evolution.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And they evolve in
their own planets,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
trying to take much
as power as possible

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:84%
from the spiritual world
through the physical bodies.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:10%
So both of them are
kind of the same,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:10%
looking in different
perspectives.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The Plaedians have the goal
to bring heaven on Earth,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and the Arcturians have a goal
to bring that Earth to heaven.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a goal that they
want to leave the material

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
world, but they want to create
a physical world that is exactly

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:90%
the same as the ethereal one.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So improving this reality,
improving the matter, in order

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
to create civilizations
and create beings,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the light that
is within the structures

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
of three-dimensional realities.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So both of them are kind
of a team, a team in which

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
play Plaedians guide the
spirit inside the bodies,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians guide the
bodies to find the spirit.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:10%
Because of this, we can see
Plaedians and Arcturians that

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:10%
are kind of similar in shapes.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And that shape is the
tetrahedron and the Merkaba.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
They divided in the Merkaba
so every chakra of themselves

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
has the expression of the
power of each one of them.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:90%
So they have two hands.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:90%
They had a head.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.020 align:middle line:90%
They had a neck.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:90%
They had legs and feet.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:10%
So they are split in the
shape of the Merkaba.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we are
more attached to them,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
because we are like the
product of both of them.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
They are like our mothers
and fathers from the galaxy.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
are so similar to us.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's not because
they are similar to us.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:10%
It's because we are
similar to them.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:10%
They were first, in the time
where here and this planet

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:10%
was just water and bacteria.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were beginning to
create their own civilizations.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The Plaedian ones
created the civilizations

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
in some planets that
were similar to suns.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:90%
They were enlightened.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:84%
They had these cities that
were like light structures.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.470 align:middle line:90%
And they were not very physical.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
They were levitating.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They used the mind to
move through space.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we can relate
them with the shape of angels,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful
beings with their hair

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
more like light
than physical hair

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and their eyes more like
galaxies, with many colors.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Also, you would never
see a Plaedian spaceship,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
because their spaceship
is the Merkaba.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They traveled through time
and space with the Merkaba.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, when
we see Plaedian shapes,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:90%
we see a sphere of light.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:10%
Because it's the Merkaba
moving so fast that we

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.960 align:middle line:10%
can see this sphere instead
of a mechanism structure,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:10%
like Arcturians would do.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, in
history, the people

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.750 align:middle line:84%
used to call angels
to those beings that

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:84%
were coming from the
sky to talk with humans.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Angels go all
around the universe.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:84%
They move like the white
cells through our blood.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:84%
They try to reach for
those viruses, bacteria,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
places that are harmed, the
ones that we have in the system.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would go there
to protect and enlighten

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
this wound, so we
could be healed,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and we could keep creating
without any problem.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Angels are the projection
of light of geometry.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So they have kind of
a shape of a human,

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
but they are not specifically
the same as a human.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
They would be seen like
these rays of light.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:10%
When they get dense to
us, we could see them

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:10%
with eyes and a weird face,
almost without a mouth,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:10%
and all these feathers
or wings around.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:10%
But they are geometry.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:10%
They are irradiating these
geometry patterns around

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:10%
that we see moving.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And we see how they
moved around them.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:10%
So that's why, coming
from the skies,

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:10%
with these patterns around,
it kind of looks like angels,

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:10%
like feathers, like
wings of the birds.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we have this
mistake with putting angels

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:10%
like Plaedians.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:10%
Plaedians are similar
to angels in shape,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:10%
but they are more human-shaped.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:10%
We can see their faces.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:90%
We can see their mouth.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:90%
They can talk to us.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:90%
They have hands.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:90%
They have feet.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:10%
They have these machines
of light in which

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:10%
they came from the sky.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:10%
So whenever we
see someone coming

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.510 align:middle line:10%
from the skies in
these spheres of light,

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:10%
and they have this
look like angels,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:10%
and they came to
Earth to give messages

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:10%
to the people of
this planet, we are

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:10%
talking about
Plaedian people, which

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:10%
are in between the fourth
and the fifth dimension.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And angels are those geometrical
beings irradiating light

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
in between the sixth and
the seventh dimension that

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.190 align:middle line:84%
are aware of everything that
happens in every dimension.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
protectors of this reality,

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:90%
like the white cells of God.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.170 align:middle line:10%
The difference between
humans and Plaedians

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:10%
is mainly that they don't live
in a three-dimensional world.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And they don't need the
same things like us.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:90%
They usually don't have sex.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So they just experience
sex by sexuality--

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
as we understand it, like
feeling the other one, and not

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:90%
even touching, like tantra.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
genitals like we do.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.847 align:middle line:84%
And they lost their
connection to the root chakra,

00:15:32.847 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:90%
to the core of the planet.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.097 align:middle line:84%
Because they connect with
the planet and the reality

00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:37.230 align:middle line:90%
through the heart.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have the same
system of organs that we do,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
because they evolve in a way
that they don't need to eat.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they have a
tiny mouth and long neck, just

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%
to have better vibration.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, Arcturians
had a more elongated head

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:90%
and big eyes.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:10%
But they are more similar to us,
because they are more grounded.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So they have the same
structure of chakras.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They do reproduce
through sex, like we do.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And they have the same
type of hands, of body.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:10%
They're maybe a
little bit more tall,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:10%
but normally, usually, like us.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And also, depending on the
race that we are talking to,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:84%
they could be a blind
person or a black person.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And the blue ones are
also Nordic shapes,

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:10%
but with blue skin.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:10%
We have to remember that we
are talking about species, not

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.470 align:middle line:10%
races.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:10%
In every galaxy, in every
system, in every planet,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.860 align:middle line:10%
as we have the black race,
yellow, white, or whatever

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:10%
we want to call it, they
also have different types

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.130 align:middle line:10%
of races in their own systems.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:10%
So that's why we
can find Arcturians

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:10%
that we can see them like blue.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:84%
And they are blue
because of the blood.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:90%
They have blue blood.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:90%
So they become like blue skin.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And the color that they
have is because they don't

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:90%
have oxygen in their planets.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
the same system

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:90%
of breathing that we have.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have red
blood because it is

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:90%
the oxygen oxidizing the blood.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's
red like Mars.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:10%
We can find some Arcturians
that you can see,

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:10%
like normal humans
here living on Earth--

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:10%
a little bit taller--

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:10%
but other ones that we used to
call the blue ones in Atlantis.

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.150 align:middle line:84%
They were the wise
ones that came

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to teach us about our blood,
about the truth within us.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, for all
the ancient cultures,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:84%
those blue ones were the gods
that told us about the power

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, in
Mexico, in South America,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, in India,
we have these gods

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:90%
with blue painting in the face.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Plaedian people also
have different races.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But they're more
bounded by the color

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:84%
of their soul, the color
of their vibration,

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:90%
than the genetic information.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we can
find some Plaedians more

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
similar to each race
of our human races.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But they're these colors like
black, like yellow, like white,

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:84%
red, because they are bounded
to the vibration of their soul,

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:90%
of the energy of their bodies.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we can
find different races

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:84%
in Plaedian people, but
they are not in the skin.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:23.120 align:middle line:84%
They are more in the
energy that they have.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Plaedians were one of the
species that didn't give

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:90%
much information of genetics.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:84%
They gave more information
through vibration

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and through our
blood than our cells.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Where ancient people
related to them was,

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
all the arts and all the
culture that we have within

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
came from the teachings from
the people from Pleiades.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Greek people
also named the Pleiades

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
the muse that teaches us
about music, art, painting.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they wear the spirits
that taught us about the power

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:90%
that we have within.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:10%
The ancients talked
about Arcturians

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:10%
like the fathers and
mothers from the stars.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:10%
And they literally were
fathers and mothers

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:10%
because they were able to
reproduce themselves here

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:10%
through sexuality
in this planet.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So they were the first ones
that we used to call the gods,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
like all these people from
heavens that came and had sex

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
with women and
with men on Earth,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
like the Bible says, like
Egyptians, like in Mexico,

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
all the stories of these
people coming from heavens

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and having relations and kids
with the people from Earth.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Those were the Arcturians.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And they were
these beings trying

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
to put the information from
the stars in the planet.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So they were the chosen ones
to create this perfect race

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that we call the atil-khef,
which means the blue ones,

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and what gave the name
to Atlantis, Khefislion.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantis civilization
was the product

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:90%
of Arcturian people.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But the first Atlantis was
not about pyramids and about

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:90%
temples.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:90%
It was about the temple within.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing that we
inherited from Arcturus

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:90%
was the Valkymia and medicine.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They taught us how to
understand our bodies, how

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to relate with the
world, how to use

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:90%
the medicine from the world.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And they gave us the
idea that every temple

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
to build was a temple

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:84%
to connect and to
awaken the information

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.180 align:middle line:90%
of our blood and our cells.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why, from the
first stages of humanity,

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the main humans were building
stone circles everywhere

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:90%
in the world--

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
lines or stone
circles that allow

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:84%
us to go within the vibration
system of Arcturians people

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and awaken the power within
our blood, our cells.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to see the
connection history of Arcturian

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:84%
civilization, you would
have to look for every stone

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:90%
circle around the planet.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:10%
For Arcturians, the
most important thing

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:10%
was to recognize that all the
information was not outside.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:10%
It was inside.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:10%
And it was not spiritual,
like for Plaedian people.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:90%
It was physical.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was in our blood
and in our cells by DNA.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So they tried to teach to every
human that the most important

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:84%
in shape in the
universe is the sphere.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
sphere, every cell

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is like a sphere that is
holding the octahedron within.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
This octahedron within is the
geometrical structure in which

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.460 align:middle line:90%
a cell is being created.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:90%
So we had the tetrahedron.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:90%
Two tetrahedron creates a cube.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And a cube is bounded by
the structure of octahedron.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the octahedron
created, after the Merkaba

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and then the cube of realities
of the eight dimensions around

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and one within, you
have the structure

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:84%
of the octahedron that will
pull the patterns of the chakras

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.350 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So that separates the core
of reality into chakras.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you
touch every corner

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and every vortex
of the octahedron,

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:90%
you will have the sphere.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And that sphere that
you hold is a cell.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So they were teaching
everyone, this is a cell.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And in order to awake the power
of the DNA you have inside,

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.250 align:middle line:90%
you have to go within the cell.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So because it was
so difficult for us

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
as humans to build a
sphere, to be in the middle

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and to see every perspective,
the most accurate shape

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that we could have to be
within a sphere, a cell,

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.070 align:middle line:90%
it was octahedron.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, then, the
Syrians came and taught us

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
how to build these octahedrons
that the Arcturians were

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
pyramids with chambers

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
inside all over the world.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:10%
If we would like to understand
Plaedians and Arcturians

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:10%
in our culture
today, I would say

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:10%
that Plaedians is spirituality,
religion, faith, and Arcturians

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:10%
are science and medicine.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:34.580 align:middle line:10%
So both of them are so
important for every human.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.780 align:middle line:10%
Because this one
here, the science,

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:10%
is helping us to understand
the world and the power

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:10%
that matter has in reality, and
how we are built like the best

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:10%
machines, to create
life and consciousness,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:10%
and we are capable
of everything.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:10%
And in the other
hand, the Plaedians

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:10%
have the spirituality,
and religion,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:10%
and all the unseen that tells
us that this is just way to go.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:10%
But there are many other ways.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:10%
And they escape to
where we believe,

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:10%
what we think, what
we see, where we feel.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond everything.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think that every human has
these two faces that create us

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning--

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
the science that
teaches us how we work

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:84%
and everything that we can
do, and the spirituality

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and religion that
tell us that there

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
is something else
that we should always

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%
keep looking for more beyond.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:84%
This are the main things
that they inherit to us

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:90%
and that we keep within today.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.220 align:middle line:10%
So all the knowledge
that we have,

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:10%
all the technology,
all the civilizations

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:10%
that we had created is something
that we inherit directly

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:10%
from the Arcturian people.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And we are what we are
now because of them.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to be
what we are going to be

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:90%
because of Plaedian people.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.250 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.990 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode,
we will explore

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.330 align:middle line:10%
the reptilians and the giants
and how they prepared the Earth

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.020 align:middle line:10%
for the human experiment.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:46.000 align:middle line:90%
