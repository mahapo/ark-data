00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the seven
laws of the universe?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:10%
I am your host,
MatÃ­as De Stefano.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore how the seven laws

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:10%
of the universe affect you
and how you cannot escape it.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
When I used to live
in Gludok in Sirius,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
we had the laws of the universe
like the main school teaching.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:84%
What we've learned is that there
are some rules that you cannot

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
escape from, that there are
some rules from the core

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that states
the whole universe in a kind

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:90%
of an order.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter at what
time you go, at what space

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
you go, what do you
create in the universe--

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
you will have these seven
laws of the universe that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
will hold you to be in
order of the creation

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and expansion of the universe.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
When the In-Na
people from Gludok

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and other beings
from this galaxy

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
start to teach humanity how
to learn about this laws that

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
goes through every
dimension, they

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
knew that we, as
humanity, in this planet

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
of the third dimension were not
able to understand the seven

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:84%
laws of the universe just by
thinking about them or just

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:90%
by seeing them like a whole.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So in this planet, we start
to create the initiatic path.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The initiatic path were built
by ancient civilizations

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
in order to teach
people how to integrate

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the seven laws of the universe
and to became a God on Earth.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can
create a new reality

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
is if you know the laws
that holds those realities.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we needed to
understand how to handle them.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And if you cannot go away
from these seven laws,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
become the seven laws.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago, I was
born in northern Egypt.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Egypt didn't exist.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
It was a colony of Atlantis.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
We call Atlantis Hefian.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And we called the
river Nile Tulfa.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And this region was called Kem.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I was a woman there.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And women were in charge
of government at that time.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It was matriarchal government.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And we were the ones that
lead people as mothers

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
temples of reality.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So we could prepare
them as our sons

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to be ready to become
gods and goddess.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The whole path of
the river Nile was

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
built towards this 7 laws in
which our ancients families

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:90%
from Atlantis, from Hefian--

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
they taught us how to
build this temples in order

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to prepare this people to
be aware of their divinity.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Those schools-- they were
learning about every law--

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.210 align:middle line:84%
were just temples, but
doesn't matter where

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:90%
do you go in the universe.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.080 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the desert,
if you go to the forest,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:90%
you will find them--

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter if there
is a temple or not.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
You will find the
laws everywhere.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You will find them, because
they are within you.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
In the world of
3D, we had to split

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:90%
in several parts this laws.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So we could understand
each other within us.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And reality had separated
this laws that were just one

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
in the seven laws
of our own body,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:90%
what we call the seven chakras.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.790 align:middle line:84%
The seven inner
chakras of our body,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
which are not only
parts of the body,

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
but also organs and glands,
particular plants that

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:84%
help us to exist
to live are also

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
bounded to the laws
of the universe.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So we-- in our
daily life, we have

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to be clear and
consequent with the action

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
of every one of those
glands, because they reflect

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:90%
the laws of the universe.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you are coherent
with every one of them,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
you can achieve the seven
laws of the universe within.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The place or the
moment, where you

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
can find the seven
laws of the universe

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:90%
is in the seventh dimension.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
The seventh dimension was
born from the sixth dimension

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and all the others that creates
this shape of an octahedron.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:84%
This core of the first
dimension created in the duality

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:84%
in the second dimension
created in the fourth dimension

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and in between the
third dimension,

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:84%
creates after that
the fifth dimension

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
evolve to see the whole
process, and then below,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
the sixth dimension
to transform and to be

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
an alchemist, a creator
of your own reality.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
In the seventh dimension,
we'll go to the core of reality

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the universe.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the seventh
dimension is called

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:90%
the dimension of enlightenment.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a dimension,
where everything

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
is kind of so well and so fine
that we used to call it Heaven.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
For many people
that is religious,

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
when they talk about
Heaven, we are talking

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:90%
about the seventh dimension.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's the place, the
moment of the universe,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
where you can feel everything
when you can see everything.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have so much light and
so much clarify of yourself

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:90%
that you can see everything.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And you are not in need
of creating anything else.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
You just have
realized that you are.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The people and beings that
lives in the seventh dimension--

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
they are so coherent
in the seven

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
laws of the universe
as one that they just

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:90%
dream about realities.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They are just like kids,
smiling and laughing

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the whole time,
like someone that

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
has accomplished everything
and accomplish harmony.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The seventh dimension is in
the core of this reality hold

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:84%
by the fifth, the sixth,
and the fourth dimension.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to the mind
and the dream of the creator.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So in the seventh
dimension, you can

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:84%
feel every possibility of who
you are, who could you be.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And you just have
to think about it.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:90%
And you will see it.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.620 align:middle line:90%
And you will feel it.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So the first law of
the seven is, indeed,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:90%
the only law that exists.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:90%
There is no seven laws.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just one law of
the whole universe.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mind.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you think and
project as your thinking,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts would become real.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So in order to be understandable
for the third dimension

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and to be lived by the
third dimensional beings,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
the seventh dimension has
to be split in seven parts

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:90%
to be seen.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why we say
there are seven laws.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's just one
law split in seven.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So we, as beings, in
the material world--

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
we can also attach those laws
within in every chakra that was

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:90%
created in the sixth dimension.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The first law would be the
mind, so the crown chakra.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%
We call it mentalism.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Mentalism is the first
law of the whole universe

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and is the one that
creates everything else.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
The crown chakra holds
the law of mentalism

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and is the chakra
and the law that that

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:84%
says that everything that
you live is what you believe.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you experience
is what you are thinking.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Mind is not something that
you think, I want this.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Mind is something
you have to become.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:10%
The mind is your
vibration, what you are,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:10%
is the levels and waves
that you split all around

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:10%
your creation, your
body, your being.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:84%
If you say, I want
this, the universe

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:90%
will create the wave of, I want.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I want.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I want.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So you will always
experience the, I want.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But you won't have
anything, because your wave

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
of thinking-- it is just
the need of something.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have to change
the way you move

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
the energy through your mind.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to become
what you want.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why we think
we want some stuff,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
or we would become some stuff.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:90%
But we always think in future.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
universe never brings

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
you what do you think in future,
because future doesn't exist.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think
always in present

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.900 align:middle line:90%
and become that person to you.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't have
that, the only way

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that the mind
creates the reality

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
is when the mind knows that
that reality is yourself.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
think in the future.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:90%
You have to be your thinkings.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's the coherence.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
That's why the crown
chakra means mentalism.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:26.900 align:middle line:10%
Mentalism is what you are, not
what you think you want to be.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit know
that it is something,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
that it is a being that is
trying to learn from itself.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
That's why we are not perfect.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
We, as reality, are
imperfect all the time,

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:84%
because if we were perfect
how the being would experience

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
something to understand itself?

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
You need to be different
from each other

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
to see different perspectives.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why reality
is not perfect.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The perfection of the
reality is its imperfection,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.100 align:middle line:84%
because the spirit knows
that in order to understand

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
itself must become imperfect.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's become the
second law in the third eye,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:90%
which is correspondence.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Correspondence is you are
outside what you are within.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is outside
will create what it's within.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And everything within
will create the outside.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Everything you see
from inside to outside

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and all the information that
is outside that condition

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
your inside is just
another expression

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of your mind trying to show
yourself who you really are.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
the universe the way

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
you can see who you are
is by correspondence.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.557 align:middle line:84%
Everything is correspondence
outside and within.

00:11:52.557 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why for
the correspondence,

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
we need this eyes to
see, two ears to hear,

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:90%
the nose to smell.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.920 align:middle line:84%
All the two parts
of our being needs

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
to be two to see the both parts,
the positive and the negative,

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to hold that information from
the positive and the negative

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:84%
all the time, from
within and outside.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's the law
of correspondence.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So once the
mentalism has created

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:84%
this body and this
reality to see itself,

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
correspondence will help
us to see those realities

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and to see the mirrors
of the distortion.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the universe
has a correspondence.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So nothing happens just
because it happens outside.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes from
within, from the mind.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Once you have seen the
correspondence of the universe,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
then you realize that everything
is connected by vibration,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
that the whole universe,
that every reality that

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
is outside and is
within is connected

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:90%
via these waves of vibration.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Vibration will come from the
third eye to the throat chakra.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:84%
The throat chakra
is the one that

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.820 align:middle line:84%
makes the vibration and that
the whole universe by the sound.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
The sound of
vibration is the one

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that creates all
this waves that helps

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to create the correspondence
in the universe.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Every wave-- when you do a
low vibration, everything

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that is coming to you, it
will be a low vibration.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
If you make a high
vibration, everything

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:84%
that is coming to you
is high vibration.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's like throwing
a stone on a lake.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
weight of the stone,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:84%
you will create one type
of waves or another.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So whatever vibration
you make and you resound

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
in the universe will
be correspondence

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.500 align:middle line:90%
to you through that vibration.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
the ancient times,

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
they told us that
what you say is

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:90%
what you are going to create.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The word is the
one that creates.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why even in
the Bible, it says,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and God said, because the
verb is the first thing that

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:90%
exists in the universe.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
It was the verb that
create the lights.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's the wave
of vibration that

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
creates the correspondence
of the universe, everything

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:90%
that it's going to be outside--

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:84%
it will be created
by the waves that you

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:84%
had expressed in the
beginning of your creation.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we have
to be very careful

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
not only what we think,
but also in how do we say

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:84%
things, because the
way you pronounce

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:84%
the words, with the intention
you pronounce the words

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:55.400 align:middle line:84%
is the thing that is coming
back to you by correspondence.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything is by
vibrating in the universe.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter
where do you go.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Even if you go
just to your mind,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
everything will be vibrating,
because the creation is

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:90%
constant vibration.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's the law of love.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
When you go out the system of
vibration, you plus the rhythm.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Rhythm-- it will be
the heart chakra.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Rhythm is the s that teach you
that everything in the universe

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:90%
has a time to do something.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
this vibration, you

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
will have a high moment
and the low moment.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:90%
High low moment, low moment--

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
all the time you are positive
and negative, positive

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and negative, outside,
within, outside, within.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the vibration
of the universe.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But the times you take,
according to the vibration,

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:84%
if it's low or
high vibration, it

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.480 align:middle line:84%
will be different
rhythms in creation.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So rhythms are
connected to time.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
How many times you
vibrate is the rhythm

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:90%
you will have in the universe.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to respect rhythms
in order to do things.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:20.820 align:middle line:84%
If your vibration is very low,
the time will be very long.

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So things will seem very
longer than they really are,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
because the wave of
vibration is so low

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.840 align:middle line:90%
that you will see it like this.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So from go to this
point to this point,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
it will take, like, a long
term to go and go back.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the rhythm of
time, maybe 2,000 years

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
to do that, because you
are in the low vibration.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
If you are in the
high vibration,

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
you will have just a few
days to change in the rhythm.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So if the heart goes faster,
the rhythm goes faster.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:90%
The vibration go faster.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So the times to do a
process will be shorter.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what you have to
understand that if you live

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
a life in a very low frequency,
in a very low vibration,

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:84%
you cannot ask the universe to
change your life the next day.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to change
your vibration in order

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to change the times
of change your life.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.510 align:middle line:84%
You won't change your
life just in one or two

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:90%
days if you vibrates very low.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So you need to change
your vibration,

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:84%
change the way you talk,
change the way you think.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, the rhythm will start
to beat in a different level

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:90%
of vibration.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's shortens the time
until you changed your life.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you are in
a very high vibration,

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
the changes will be
so fast all the time

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that you will not have time to
recognize why you are changing.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we need
to look for the harmony.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Harmony is to talk
really in the past,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.550 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
you say, to have time

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to think about
what you're saying,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to see if the other
people are understanding

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.700 align:middle line:84%
what you say if the words
are very well pronounced.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, the rhythm of your
heart will be step by step,

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:90%
like a normal beat.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And that makes a normal life.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So normal life is not to be
all the time well and fine.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Normal life is to
find the moments

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:40.310 align:middle line:90%
that you have to go out.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:90%
You have to go in, out and in.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's good for the
rhythm to understand

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that if you feel sad,
you have to feel sad.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You need to feel
sadness, because it's

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
a moment, where you go within
to see a part of yourself that

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:90%
was not taken in count.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So you have to wait until
the moment that it goes out.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And you find the happiness,
that the happiness-- you will

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
find it when the rhythm has
changed by itself according

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:90%
to your vibration.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:84%
If you, then, wait
for the rhythms,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
for the times to go through, you
are accelerating their process.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And it will take
you to a crisis.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So a crisis will be a
wreck in your life--

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
an accident, trauma, or
whatever that brings you,

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.040 align:middle line:90%
again, to the flow.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
So

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why rhythm and
vibration are very together.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is to express what
you feel, what you are.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:84%
This vibration and rhythm
that you have from yourself

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
is also connected
to cause and effect,

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
which will be the fifth law
connected to the plexus.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It will be the
one that tells you

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
that your vibration
and your rhythm

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is conditioning everything
that is happening in your life.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have a low vibration,
everything that you do

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.280 align:middle line:84%
will come back to you
as a low vibration.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you do
in the universe,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
you will come back with an-- as
an effect of what you caused.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Nothing escapes from this
law of cause and effect.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Every cause has an effect.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Every effect has a cause.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happens just
because it happened.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Nothing just appears
without a purpose.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So what helps you in
your daily life, when

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
you see something happen or
a situation just comes up,

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to think about,
when did this started,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.150 align:middle line:90%
why it's happening.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Do all these questions.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And go to the past
and even to the future

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.340 align:middle line:84%
to understand why it is
happening, because nothing

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:90%
happens just because of that.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
happens to you is

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
because you had created a
cause in order to it to happen.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the law
of responsibility.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It's usual for us as
humans to blame others

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
for the things
that happens to us.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It's normal, because
we are taught

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:90%
that there is good and bad.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So if something
bad happens to us,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:84%
must be that bad people
doing bad things to me,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:90%
that I am good.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like that.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
If something happens
to me in a bad way,

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
it's because I had
to learn something.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And it was not in a good way.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I was vibrating so low
that I needed an experience

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:90%
at the same level of frequency.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So when it happens bad
things to good people,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to
judge the bad thing.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to ask, are you
really a good person?

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Are you really someone
that is vibrating high?

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.660 align:middle line:90%
Or you are vibrating low.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Without judgment, just to
ask that person or yourself

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:84%
better, if it's yourself,
am I vibrating high

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.750 align:middle line:90%
if all this is happening to me?

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So you have to change your
vibration and your way

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:84%
of thinking to change the
rhythm in order to change

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.800 align:middle line:90%
the effects of your cause.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have in
your second chakra,

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%
you would have the polarity.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Polarity is the sixth law,
is the law of creation.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything has a polarity.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
positive and a negative.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So we all are
diving into a world

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.040 align:middle line:90%
of separation and polarity.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
But polarity, as the law, is not
something that is bad for you.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It's something that helps you
to go from one point to another.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Every thing that
creates us is magnetic.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:84%
We are electrons,
protons, neutrons

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.040 align:middle line:90%
that has its own way of energy.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And the positive
and negative energy

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:84%
of protons and
neutrons and electrons

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
creates the chains of
the DNA, the change

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
of the patterns in
the molecular system

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:90%
that creates our reality.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So positive and negative is
something that makes us exist.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that makes us apart.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand this,
you will see good and bad

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:90%
as a way to go forward.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:84%
You will see
positive and negative

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
as a way to evolve and go
much farther than you are now.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:90%
It's like a train going.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep it rolling
once and again, once and again.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
can keep it rolling

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:90%
is by positive and negative.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is because the only way
you can have strength to go up

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is if you go down and
take the energy to jump.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You cannot go up or jump
higher if you don't first bend

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.980 align:middle line:84%
yourself and take
the energy to go up.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why the negative
polarity helps you to go up.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And the positive
must go down in order

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
to have more energy
to go up again.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why polarity
helps you to go forward,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:84%
helps you to go in
the evolution path,

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
helps you to create
new energies.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And the last law is
connected to the root chakra.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And it is the generation.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Generation means that everything
is generated in the universe

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:90%
by the energy of polarity.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Positive and negative,
feminine, masculine

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:90%
is creating realities.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything is generating
in the universe.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing that
is just being destroyed.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything is destroyed
to be created again.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So generation is the meaning
that everything in the universe

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:84%
is being born once and
again, once and again.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:90%
It never dies.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:90%
It just transforms itself.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.885 align:middle line:84%
And we are all the time creating
new realities at every second.

00:25:25.885 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:33.250 align:middle line:84%
From the seventh dimension, we
had split this 7 laws in order

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
for everyone in many
dimensions to understand

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:90%
the creation of ourselves.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you know this
seven laws, you

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
will know how to move
through the reality.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:84%
You will know how to
handle every dimension.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:84%
You will know
exactly what you're

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
going to find in every dimension
surrounding you and within you.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
With the seven laws, it's like
the statements when you, what

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
you have as a most
important tool

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.280 align:middle line:90%
to go through every reality.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So you should know
this seven laws

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:90%
to move through the universe.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.650 align:middle line:10%
The seven laws, as I said, are
just one but split in many.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So the way, in the
third dimension,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
you can understand
them is to ask

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
to every one of your
glands in your body

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
if you are coherent
with that law.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Are you exactly what you think?

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you exactly the product
of your idea of yourself?

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.700 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about yourself?

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Think about it and
the crown chakra.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is within
you is what it's outside you.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So look around your life and
see everything that is outside

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.520 align:middle line:84%
is correspondence to
what I feel within.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:90%
What do I feel within?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.860 align:middle line:84%
What I am expressing
from within,

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.590 align:middle line:90%
so I can see this reality--

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:90%
it's my mirror.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.840 align:middle line:84%
My vibration-- what I say is
exactly what I want to say

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.875 align:middle line:90%
is my truth.

00:27:11.875 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Do I express myself in truth?

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Do I say the things I
want to say, or I shut up?

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
created surrounding me

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:90%
is because of my vibration.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Do I vibrate low?

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The expression that I
live in in the outer life

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:34.760 align:middle line:84%
is lower or higher, is
harmony, or it is a mess.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Think about what your
vibration is in this universe.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Think about your heart.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Are you balanced?

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you respect the
times of your evolution?

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you respect the
times of your life?

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Just ask yourself if you are
correspondence and coherent

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:90%
with what you feel.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you love?

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And if that is coming back
to you in a difficult way

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
through time, if it takes
longer or a short time,

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:84%
it will tell you how
your beat of your heart

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
is, if you are coherent in
your rhythm, in your time.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Look everything that
happens to you in your life,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself if
you are causing this.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
You are the cause of everything
that affect you in your life.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So if that what affects you
in your life is hard and heavy

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and pain or frustration,
it's mean, what do I feel?

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.310 align:middle line:90%
What do I have within?

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask these
questions, because I

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:90%
am the cause of those effects.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And polarity-- do I live
polarity as a creation?

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Or do I live it as a separation?

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize
that everything

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
that fights against us is just
giving us another perspective

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:90%
of who we are.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So we could have this energy
to create a new reality

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.130 align:middle line:90%
transcendental from what we are.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:90%
So that's polarity.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Polarity helps us to go
forward, not to separate us.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And after that, you
have to generate.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Every time, you have
to create new stuff,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:30.470 align:middle line:84%
because we are creators
in blood and body.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So everything that you
do has to create products

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.580 align:middle line:90%
for life for everyone.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Emotionally, mentally,
and physically, you

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
have to be someone that
creates not destroy.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you have all
this law and you

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
have the question
for each one of them,

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
you will just try to figure out
in which way of the seven laws

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.210 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Those who are really coherent
in the seven laws of your body

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
in light themselves

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.680 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that we call the
enlightened ones, the masters,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the ascendant
masters, because they

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.100 align:middle line:90%
are coherent in every chakra.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And they respect every
law of the universe.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Every law is not something that
was pushed to us from outside.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the structure that we
use to create our realities.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the 7 laws
are asking to us to be

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:90%
responsible of our creation.

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:10%
We cannot blame anyone
outside the laws.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:10%
We have written the laws.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:10%
So we have written our reality.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.420 align:middle line:84%
