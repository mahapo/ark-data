00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were the Reptilians and
Giants chosen to seed Planet

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Earth?

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.770 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we will
explore these two species

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:10%
and uncover the codes they
left for human awakening.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.070 align:middle line:84%
The main plan of the
Elohim was to create

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
a way subtle information
from other dimensions

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
could be experienced in
three-dimensional realities.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So what they had to do was to
create a path so they could

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
leave, they could
experience, they

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
could understand step by step
every part of the creation.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
As we talked once before,
positive and negative,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
in duality, are the forces that
help us create the realities

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and to improve the
system by polarity.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Polarity is the
key to understand

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
how to improve through problems,
through solving questions that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:90%
happens all the time in life.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So what we had to
do was to create

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
a path that state by
state could take us

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
from positive to negative,
from negative to positive,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
once again creating what we
call the DNA and this chain

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of electrons that brings
us towards evolution

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:90%
in this eternal spiral.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
travels through mind

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:90%
and also through emotion.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Emotion is the energy that
allows us to record everything

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:90%
that happens in our lives.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Emotions is the soul, the
main source of every memory.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So we needed emotions
to create more energy,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:84%
to create more organs,
to create more abilities

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
so, like a library,
we could record

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
every memory of every experience
during the whole evolution.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the other hand, we
had to go through the mind.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We had to go through the process
of understanding the reality

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
through the meditation,
through thinking,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
through all the information.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
Elohim create species

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that would help the negative
energy and the positive energy,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and both of them had to work
together to create new systems,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
new evolution, new
bodies in which

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:84%
we could experience different
ways of understanding.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:10%
In Atlantean times, we
used to call these two

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:10%
ways the Sofhir and the Neymir.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:10%
They were the first
beings on arriving

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:10%
to this planet that
represented for us

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:10%
the negative and the positive.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:90%
They were not good or bad.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
They were just
different ways in which

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
we could experience how
to evolve through emotions

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and through mind.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:10%
When we needed to
record all the data

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:10%
from every step of evolution,
we needed all the registry

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:10%
of emotions in
survival, because when

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:10%
beings in the fifth dimension,
the fourth dimension

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:10%
are eternal, they don't have
this meaning of survival

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:10%
because they don't have death.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
If they don't have
an ending process,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
so what we have is
eternal beings that

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what is
to survive, doesn't

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
know what is to keep
going and creating

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:90%
more data and information.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, in
the fourth dimension,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:84%
we decided in the
universe to create death.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
That's created for the
three-dimensional beings

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:90%
the information of survival.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So every species, every
being since bacteria

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:84%
until us has this code that what
we have to do is to survive,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and all this
information that we now

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
have in our body of survival
is because of the Reptilians.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:84%
In Atlantis, we call
the Reptilians Sofhir.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Sofhir were this
main species that

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
represented all the codes and
the information of survival

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:90%
in planets like Earth.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
They knew by experience
in every planet

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that they had lived
how to survive,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
how to understand the
world, how to pass

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the information through blood
to other beings along history.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Reptilians
and all the legacy

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that they had before and after
them were the codes of emotion.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:84%
They used emotion to
capture information.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
They used emotion to awake
the power of information.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they needed
to live to experience

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:90%
and to survive.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:84%
They were the first beings
to teach how it is to survive

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and to be eternal,
even exist in death.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:10%
In the other hand, we have the
Giants that in Atlantean time

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:10%
we call the Neymir.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Neymir were these beings
that came to Earth to keep

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:90%
the information in the ice.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They captured
information outside,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and they were the
recorders of everything

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:90%
that happened in history.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So they were working
with the mind.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.000 align:middle line:84%
They just used
telepathy to talk,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and they only lived
in cold places.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the registry
that we have from them

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.592 align:middle line:84%
is enclosed by the North
Pole or Antarctica.

00:06:18.592 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The Neymir had this raw
way of showing themselves.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
They were covered by
skins because of the cold.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:90%
They were pale.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They had this similar shapes
to our ancient humans,

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:90%
but they were really big.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call
them the Giants,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and they had some
kind of contact

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
with humans at some
point of the history.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But they were really
close to the contact

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:90%
to any other species.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't come
to reach humanity.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Humans would go and
reach for them to advice.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
We thought that they were
gods because they were living

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:84%
in places that
humans couldn't live

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and they were closer
to the heavens.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that they
were one of the most

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:84%
ancient beings in human
shape here in the planet.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
The first time that
Neymir has come to Earth

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
was around one
million years ago.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They were from
planets that was cold.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were connected

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to the information of the cold,
the ice, the library of nature.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why they settle in the
north in Scandinavia, Siberia,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Alaska, Canada, Greenland, all
this region mostly in Siberia

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
because the biggest portal
of the planet in the cold

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
was North Pole,
the physical one,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and magnetically it was
the Baikal Lake in Siberia.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
These regions were the ones
that opened the information

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:84%
for the moon and the feminine
aspect of the universe

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:90%
to come to the Earth.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:10%
So that's why they choose
that region to create

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:10%
a civilization, the
civilization created

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:10%
that we now know as Hyperboria.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:10%
Hyperboria was this group
of people, hundreds of them,

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:10%
that lived in small groups, like
tribes, around the cold areas.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.960 align:middle line:10%
And they used to go to
the core of the planet

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:10%
through the caves,
through the tunnels that

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:10%
connected the underground
system of the planet.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So they would be able to
live in cold temperature,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
holding all this
information from the ice.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
These Giants were guided
by other cultures,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
other beings from
other planets to seed

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
the information in the ice.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.430 align:middle line:84%
We know water was the
body of the planet,

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and they had to take care of
the information of the planet

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
before any consciousness
would come to this planet.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's why before humans
arise as cultural beings,

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
as beings with
awareness of themself,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.740 align:middle line:84%
they had to come here
to prepare the ice

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to record every information
from other planets.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Water is a living being
that changes the shapes

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
through vibration.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
It adapts to the
vibration surrounding it.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the Giants
and many other beings

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
use vibration and
music, singings, to put

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:90%
the information on the ice.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So they were the
first beings that

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
taught to humanity how to
sing, to talk with the world,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:90%
to speak with nature.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why Giants
were at the first time

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
the guides of how to read the
books of the ice and the snow,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.690 align:middle line:84%
how to read the information,
and then also, like we did,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.580 align:middle line:90%
they lost that connection.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:90%
So they used to sing.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They used to have these big
stone circles and big stone

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
temples where they used to
do these ceremonies, just two

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
or three of them, to encode
the information in this planet,

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:84%
bringing it from the
stars during the night

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.295 align:middle line:84%
and singing the codes
from the stars to the ice.

00:10:54.295 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
The first Neymir
were the keepers.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
They were in charge of keeping
the eyes of the planet open,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
the doors to other dimensions.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
The two eyes of the planet we
call the door of North Pole

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:90%
and the door of South Pole.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, they call
these whole places

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.010 align:middle line:84%
where you can get inside
Earth, but it's not

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:90%
physically inside Earth.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It's going through Earth
to other dimensions too.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So they were the keepers of
those two eyes of the planet.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:10%
But when they split and they
separated when the climate

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:10%
change came, they
survived through history

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.300 align:middle line:10%
because they were
moving around parts

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:10%
of the planet like
Europe and Middle East

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:10%
and Asia and North America.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:10%
While this Ice Age reached
really far south in the planet,

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:10%
they were able to live even
closer to the Mediterranean

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:10%
and to the Indian Sea.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So that created many
different countries or regions

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
where they were living,
and that was in the time

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
where humans arrived and
there exist Homo sapiens.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The Giants were
beings that were not

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:90%
in a organized civilization.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
They were all split around,
and they were lonely.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe two or three of them were
taking care of a whole region

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
because they were
not very friendly.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So even if they were good,
they were not very friendly.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:90%
They were more like bears.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
They took care of caves
of ice, and that's it.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Nobody would talk to
them until they decided

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to use humans to reproduce.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:84%
For the memories they had, the
Sofhir, the second in coming,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.420 align:middle line:84%
they came from the underground,
not from the skies.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
The fathers of the Sofhir
were the Draconians,

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.600 align:middle line:90%
and they came from the stars.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But the Reptilians were
created here on this planet.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:84%
The Elohim needed to create
this path towards evolution

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.610 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:84%
They were reaching through
Draco constellation how

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
they could build a
beam that could have

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
the ability to survive, to
adapt, to live in a very

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
difficult environment,
like in this planet,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.805 align:middle line:84%
and also have the information
within through emotion.

00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Draconians were not like
Dragons or Reptilians.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:90%
They were different.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
They had different
types of bodies.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:84%
They had long arms, and they
barely used the legs to walk.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And Draconians were really
cold, and they were geneticists.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So they started to look for
beings in different planets

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that would be able to hold their
information and to survive.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
They found here on Earth that
these reptiles beings start

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.860 align:middle line:84%
to evolve like the dinosaurs,
and they took some samples

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
from this planet to create a
conscious, an aware being that

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
would be able to bring all the
information from all the stars

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and survive in this
changing planet.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians, the
Sofhir, were the ones

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
that had all this
information within,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and they had the ability
to survive in this planet

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.100 align:middle line:84%
because they took the
information from the reptiles

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:90%
of this planet.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians had this body similar
to their fathers and mothers

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:90%
from the stars.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The image I have from
them was being curved

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and having these canes
to represent the power

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
of the snake on Earth.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
They were kind of similar to
humans because they had hands,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:84%
they had arms, but they
had the skin of snakes.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
They had the skin of
Reptilians from this planet.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So they had these yellow eyes,
these different types of mouth,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:90%
like kind of a reptile human.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.030 align:middle line:84%
As I can remember
the stories that I've

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
been told from Reptilians,
they used to live in the caves

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and used to live
very far from humans

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains
and the deserts.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So they were a very
reclusive species.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Like lizards, like
many reptiles,

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.950 align:middle line:84%
they used to work alone, and
they had their own spaces

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:84%
in the desert, in the
mountains, so they wouldn't

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
have this structure of
society that we could think

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:03.600 align:middle line:84%
about cities, about
dressing in such a way

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
that you could relate
to human culture.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:84%
They would be like these
hermit people that were hidden

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and that human would reach them
to seek for advice, for wisdom,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and to ask for them for
information about what

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to do in their lives
in their civilization.

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:84%
When the Ice Age
ended and the Neymir

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.000 align:middle line:84%
had to go back to North Pole,
closer to the North Pole

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and closer to the
South Pole, the Sofhir

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:90%
were ruling the whole planet.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.080 align:middle line:10%
So that's why normally in
the most hottest regions

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:10%
of the planet
between the tropics,

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:10%
they kind of rise this empire
of civilization that they had.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
The most important moment
for Reptilians in history

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
was when they achieved the
biggest portal on Earth, which

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.400 align:middle line:90%
is the heart of the snake.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
The heart of the snake
is what we call now Iran.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:10%
In that region,
they have the power

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:10%
of the heart of the snake.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:84%
The wisdom of all
the human history

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is in the desert
of Zagros Mountain.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:10%
So they start to
create this idea

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:10%
that they were the
most important beings

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:10%
in this planet, and
they had the ability

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:10%
to control the emotions of
every being surrounding them

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:10%
so they can work for them.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:52.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why they were
so difficult to handle,

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
because they were
not bad for us,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
they did a lot of
good things for us,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:84%
but if we would do something
different from what they

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:90%
wanted, they would conquer us.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Reptilians split
in different hot regions

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, and
they had the knowledge

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.960 align:middle line:84%
within of how to survive
in different planets.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They had the knowledge of
how to handle emotions.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:84%
They had cold blood, so that's
why they knew how to handle

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:31.800 align:middle line:84%
the energy of their bodies
and to decide when shut it up

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
or when turn it on, something
that we mammals cannot do.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It's more difficult for us.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to achieve
all the information that they

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
had within, and they were
the builders of wisdom

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.340 align:middle line:90%
in this planet.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's why all the gods and
goddess of history at first

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:90%
they were snakes--

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
all regions in the planet, like
in the outback of Australia,

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in India with the kundalini
concept with naga,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
all the ideas of the dragons
in the Mediterranean Sea,

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
in China, Japan, the
god snake in Mexico,

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
in all North America, the
sacred snake of the Amazonia,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:84%
every snake in Egypt that we
can see the kings and queens

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:90%
with the snake in the head.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So snakes were the most
important beings for us

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.000 align:middle line:90%
because they gave us knowledge.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:84%
They gave us the information
of how to rule ourselves.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They gave us everything
that we could possibly

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:90%
understand in this planet.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they became
a symbol of wisdom,

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:90%
a symbol of enlightenment.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We should not think about
them like we do now,

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
because we think about them from
the Christianity perspective,

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and Christianity perspective
has only 2,000 years,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and history of
humanity has much more.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And in all the
history of humanity,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
they honor the Reptilians
because of everything

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:90%
that they gave to us.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:84%
For every human civilization,
every human culture

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
at the very beginning,
they have one clear thing

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
that everything that creates
life, it's god in shape, it's

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.680 align:middle line:90%
god in matter.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, from the
very beginning in history

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:90%
for all humans, women were god.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
They knew that women were just
an extension of the creator.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we call
the universe the goddess.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why, in the
history of humanity,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
women were the most
important beings because they

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:90%
were able to create life.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Because of that,
in order to create,

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:90%
you need a lot of emotion.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
You cannot create without
emotions because you need a lot

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:90%
of energy to create life.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:10%
So that's why women were
related to a lot of energy,

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:10%
a lot of emotion,
and that energy

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:10%
had to be aligned in the process
of connecting with the goddess,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.360 align:middle line:10%
with the spiritual process.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And this energy that makes it
flow, that makes it create,

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:45.010 align:middle line:84%
it has the spin shape of
a snake through the body.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's why humanity
decided the shape of the snake

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:84%
as something related to
the mother, to the goddess.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:84%
This shape of the snake
meant that the energy

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:84%
flow to enlightenment was so
similar to the Reptilians.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So Reptilians and women
were working together

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
to create new civilizations,
to create new realities.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:10%
Reptilians were the
ones teaching women

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:24.010 align:middle line:10%
how to create life and how
to handle men on earth, how

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:10%
to create a society ruled
by the emotion of women

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.850 align:middle line:10%
and by the wisdom of creator.

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So they became the
first priestess,

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
the first shaman of
history to understand

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:90%
how everything worked.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And to understand that, they had
to understand that the universe

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
had the shape of a tree.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So they start to talk
about this big tree that

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:84%
has all the information,
and the fruits of the tree

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is all this wisdom that we
have to achieve in our lives.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So in history, every
culture had this sacred tree

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and the snake that
teach the women how

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:90%
to handle that information.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem was after
Reptilians when Aesir came

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.576 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to rule the
world in a different way.

00:23:18.576 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, Aesir in the
Persian region,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:26.200 align:middle line:84%
they call it the Anunnaki,
and they were also

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:90%
very tall and giants.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But they were totally different
from what the Neymir was.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So they start to rule
society, and they

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:84%
start to create this new
order of civilization.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The Aesir took the
power of the reptiles,

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and they started to rule the
planet through the wisdom

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:90%
of the reptiles.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they use the
symbols of the snake people

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to rule humanity
in their own ways.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So they took men to do the
control of the society,

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and that made that the
Reptilians and women

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.770 align:middle line:90%
were taking for the same thing.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
now with Christianity

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
saying that the
snake rule the women,

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
are a mess today.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, in our culture, we
barely have information

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:90%
from the Neymir, only stories.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But these stories tell us
about the keepers of wisdom.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:10%
For example, one of
the most known stories

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:10%
was this Giant that was
taking care of a sacred tree

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:10%
that its fruits were
the runes, and Odin

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:10%
was the god of the
Nordic people that

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:10%
went to take the
information from that Giant

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:10%
and took that wisdom from the
runes and gave it to humanity,

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:10%
and because they
were the keepers

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.860 align:middle line:10%
of the ice of the planet,
in return to that,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:10%
he had to give an eye.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's why Odin doesn't have
an eye, because of the wisdom

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that he achieved from
that tree of the Giant.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have today this idea
that the Giants were really

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:84%
rude with us, but
they were the keepers

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:84%
of something really special
and something really important.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
That was the concept
of our culture

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
as humans today, that
in order to achieve

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.730 align:middle line:84%
our goals in society, we
have to become bigger.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We have to be like
them because they

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
were the keepers of that
wisdom, of that information.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So in the other hand, we have
the Sofhir, the Reptilians,

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and they are still very
connected to our civilization

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
because they are the ones
that control our emotions.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:90%
So we are still--

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
even if we have all
this information

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and we have the science and we
have the knowledge of ourselves

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and we have improved the
civilization so much,

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:84%
we are still bounded
and ruled by emotions

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:84%
because we don't know
how to handle them.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need these
kind of systems of control,

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we used to
think that the presidents

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and the queens and all these
important people in the planet,

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:90%
they are Reptilians.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
Reptilians real.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.450 align:middle line:84%
They hold information
of the Reptilians

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:42.010 align:middle line:84%
because they were the keepers
of the information of the wisdom

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemist,
and that information

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
was learned by the Mason
people in the Middle East,

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:90%
and they brought it to Europe.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And then with the rebirth
of science and arts,

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
the Illuminati took
that information again.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So the rulers of the new
system of the New World Order,

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
they took that same information
that Reptilians used

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:90%
to have in history of humanity.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's why our
system is ruled

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
by the concept of
survival, and that's

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:23.950 align:middle line:84%
why whenever you think in
your life, I need to survive,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I need to eat, I need to
fight against something,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.110 align:middle line:84%
it's your reptilian
brain who's talking.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.870 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
me on this journey.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:10%
I am your host and
guide, Matias De Stefano.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.610 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we will
explore the moon and Anunnaki

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and how these two species
created a civilization

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:84%
structure for the
humans to transcend.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:90%
