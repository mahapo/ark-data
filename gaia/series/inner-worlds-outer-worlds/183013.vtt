00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:12.275 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:19.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning was
the logos, the Big Bang,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.120 align:middle line:90%
the primordial om.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Big Bang Theory says that the
physical universe spiraled out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.960 align:middle line:84%
of an unimaginably hot
and dense single point

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:84%
called a singularity,
billions of times smaller

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:90%
than the head of a pin.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.595 align:middle line:90%
It does not say why or how.

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
The more mysterious
something is,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the more we take for granted
that we understand it.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It was thought that
eventually gravity

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
would either slow the
expansion or contract

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.035 align:middle line:90%
the universe in a big crunch.

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.490 align:middle line:84%
However, images from the
Hubble Space Telescope

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
show that the
universe's expansion

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
seems to be actually
accelerating,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
expanding faster and faster as
it grows out of the Big Bang.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, there is more
mass in the universe

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:90%
than physics predicted.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
To account for the missing
mass, physicists now

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:84%
say that the universe
consists of only 4%

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
atomic matter, or what we
consider normal matter.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
23% of the universe
is dark matter.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And 73% is dark energy,
what we previously

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:90%
thought of as empty space.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:10%
It is like an invisible
nervous system

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.250 align:middle line:10%
that runs through the universe,
connecting all things.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
The ancient vedic teachers
taught Nada Brahma.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:90%
The universe is vibration.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The vibratory field
is at the root

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
of all true spiritual experience
and scientific investigation.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It is the same field of energy
that saints, buddhas, yogis,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
mystics, priests,
shamans, and seers

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
have observed by looking
within themselves.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It has been called
Akasha, the primordial om,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Indra's Net of Jewels,
the music of the spheres,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.625 align:middle line:84%
and a thousand other
names throughout history.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It is the common
root of all religions

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.645 align:middle line:84%
and the link between our inner
worlds and our outer worlds.

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
In Mahayana Buddhism
in the third century,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
they described a cosmology
not unlike the most advanced

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:90%
physics of modern day.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Indra's Net of
Jewels is a metaphor

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:84%
used to describe a much
older vedic teaching, which

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the way the
fabric of the universe

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
is woven together.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Indra, the King of the
Gods, gave birth to the sun

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.005 align:middle line:84%
and moves the winds
and the waters.

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a spiderweb that
extends into all dimensions.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The web is made up of
dew drops and every drop

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
contains the reflection of
all the other water drops.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And in each reflected
dew drop, you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
will find the reflections
of all the other droplets,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
the entire web in
that reflection,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:90%
and so on to infinity.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Indra's Web could be described
as a holographic universe,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
where even the smallest
stream of light

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.965 align:middle line:84%
contains the complete
pattern of the whole.

00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The Serbian-American
scientists, Nikola Tesla,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes referred
to as the man

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:90%
who invented the 20th century.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was responsible
for discovering

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
alternating current electricity
and many other creations that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
are now part of everyday life.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:10%
Because of his interest in
the ancient vedic traditions,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:10%
Tesla was in a unique position
to understand science,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.505 align:middle line:10%
through both an eastern
and western model.

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Like all great scientists,
Tesla look deeply

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
into the mysteries
of the outer world.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But he also looked
deeply within himself.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Like the ancient yogis,
Tesla used the term Akasha

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
etheric field that

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.795 align:middle line:90%
extends throughout all things.

00:05:26.795 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Tesla studied with
swami Vivekananda,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
a yogi who brought the ancient
teachings of India to the West.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
In the vedic teachings,
Akasha is space itself,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
the space that the
other elements fill,

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
which exist simultaneously
with vibration.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:90%
The two are inseparable.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Akasha is yin to Prana's yang.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:05.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.760 align:middle line:84%
A modern concept that can
help us to conceptualize

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Akasha, or the
primary substance,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:90%
is the idea of fractals.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until the 1980s
that advances in computers

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to actually
visualize and reproduce,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.350 align:middle line:84%
mathematically, the
patterns in nature.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:10%
The term fractal
was coined in 1980

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.660 align:middle line:10%
by mathematician
Manuel Mandelbrot, who

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:10%
studied certain simple
mathematical equations

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:10%
that, when they are
repeated, produce

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:10%
an unending array of changing
mathematical or geometrical

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:10%
forms within a
limited framework.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.278 align:middle line:84%
They are limited, but at
the same time, infinite.

00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:84%
A fractal is a rough
geometric shape

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that can be split into
parts, each of which

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is at least approximately
a reduced size

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:84%
copy of the whole
pattern, a property

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
called self-similarity.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Mandelbrot's fractals have being
called the Thumbprint of God.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.690 align:middle line:84%
You are seeing artwork
generated by nature itself.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
If you turn the Mandelbrot
figure a certain way,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:84%
it looks sort of like a
Hindu deity or Buddha.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:10%
This figure is being
termed a Buddhabrot figure.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:10%
If you look at some forms of
ancient art and architecture,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:10%
you will see that
humans have long

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:10%
associated beauty and the
sacred with fractal patterns.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Infinitely complex,
yet every part

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.970 align:middle line:84%
contains the seed to
recreate the whole.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Fractals have changed
mathematicians

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
views of the universe
and how it operates.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.340 align:middle line:84%
With each new level
of magnification,

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
there are differences
from the original.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Constant change
and transformation

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:84%
occurs as we traverse from
one level of fractal detail

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.450 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
This transformation
is the cosmic spiral,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.905 align:middle line:84%
the embedded intelligence
of the matrix of time space.

00:08:48.905 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Fractals are inherently chaotic,
full of noise and order.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:84%
When our minds recognize
or define a pattern,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
we focus on it, as
if it is a thing.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We try to find the patterns
we see as beautiful.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:84%
But in order to hold the
pattern in our minds,

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
we must push away the
rest of the fractal.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.863 align:middle line:10%
To comprehend a
fractal with a census

00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:56.905 align:middle line:10%
is to limit its movement.

00:09:56.905 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:10%
All energy and the universe
is neutral, timeless,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:10%
dimensionless.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Our own creativity and capacity
for pattern recognition

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
is the link between the
microcosm and macrocosm,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.265 align:middle line:84%
the timeless world of waves,
and the solid world of things.

00:10:21.265 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Observation is an
act of creation

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
through limitations
inherent in thinking.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
We are creating the illusion
of solidity, of things

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:90%
by labeling, by naming.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher Kierkegaard
said, "If you name me,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:90%
you negate me.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
By giving me a
name, a label, you

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
negate all of the other
things I could possibly be.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
You lock the particle
into being a thing

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.550 align:middle line:90%
by pinning it down, naming it.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:10%
But at the same time,
you are creating it,

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.285 align:middle line:10%
defining it to exist."

00:10:59.285 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is our
highest nature.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
With the creation
of things comes

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
time, which is what creates
the illusion of solidity.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Einstein was the first
scientist to realize

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
that what we think of as
empty space is not nothing.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It has properties.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And intrinsic to
the nature of space

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.330 align:middle line:84%
is nearly unfathomable
amounts of energy.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
The renowned physicist
Richard Feynman

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
once said, "There
is enough energy

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
in a single cubic
meter of space to boil

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.195 align:middle line:90%
all the oceans in the world."

00:11:44.195 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Advanced meditators know
that in the stillness

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.980 align:middle line:90%
lies the greatest power.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:10%
The Buddha had yet another term
for the primary substance, what

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:10%
he termed kalapas, which
are like tiny particles

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:10%
or wavelets that are
rising and passing away

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:08.715 align:middle line:10%
trillions of times per second.

00:12:08.715 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Reality is, in this
sense, like a series

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
of frames in a
holographic film camera,

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
moving quickly, so as to create
the illusion of continuity.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
When consciousness
becomes perfectly still,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
the illusion is
understood, because it

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness itself
that drives the illusion.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
traditions of the east,

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
it has been understood
for thousands of years

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that all is vibration, Nada
Brahma, the universe's sound.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:84%
The word Nada means
sound or vibration.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And Brahma is the name for God.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Brahma simultaneously is the
universe and is the creator.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.890 align:middle line:84%
The artist and the
art are inseparable.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
In the Upanishads, one of
the oldest human records

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
from ancient India,
it is said Brahma

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
the creator, sitting on
a lotus, opens his eyes

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.745 align:middle line:90%
and a world comes into being.

00:14:01.745 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.185 align:middle line:84%
Brahma closes his eyes and
a world goes out of being.

00:14:09.185 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.948 align:middle line:84%
Ancient mystics,
yogis, and seers

00:14:15.948 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
have maintained that there
is a field at the root

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness,
the Akashic field,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
or the Akashic records,
where all information,

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
all experience, past,
present, and future,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
exists now and always.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:84%
It is this field or matrix
from which all things arise,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:41.305 align:middle line:84%
from subatomic particles to
galaxies, stars, planets,

00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:42.105 align:middle line:90%
and all life.

00:14:42.105 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
You never see anything
in its totality,

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
because it is made up of
layer upon layer of vibration

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.595 align:middle line:84%
and it is constantly changing,
exchanging information

00:15:01.595 --> 00:15:02.395 align:middle line:90%
with Akasha.

00:15:02.395 --> 00:15:05.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:11.955 align:middle line:84%
A tree is drinking in the sun,
the air, the rain, the earth.

00:15:11.955 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.840 align:middle line:84%
A world of energy
moves in and out

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:90%
of this thing we call a tree.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:84%
When the thinking mind is still,
then you see reality as it is,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:90%
all aspects together.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
The tree and the sky and the
earth, the rain and the stars

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
are not separate.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Life and death, self and
other are not separate,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
just as the mountain and
the valley are inseparable.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
In the Native American and
other indigenous traditions,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
it is said that everything
has spirit, which is simply

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
another way of
saying, everything

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
one vibratory source.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
There is one
consciousness, one field,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
one force that
moves through all.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
This field is not
happening around you.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
It is happening through
you and happening as you.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
You are the you in universe.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
You are the eyes through
which creation sees itself.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
When you wake from
a dream, you realize

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that everything in
the dream was you.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:90%
You were creating it.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So-called real life
is no different.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Every one, everything is you.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
The one consciousness
looking out

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
of every eye, under every
rock, within every particle.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.300 align:middle line:10%
International
researchers at CERN,

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:10%
the European laboratory
for particle physics,

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:10%
are searching for
this field that

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:10%
extends throughout all things.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
looking within, they

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.665 align:middle line:84%
look to the outer
physical world.

00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:10%
Researchers at the
CERN Laboratory

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:10%
in Geneva, Switzerland announced
that they had found the Higgs

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:10%
boson, or the God Particle.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs Boson experiments
proved, scientifically,

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
that an invisible energy field
fills the vacuum of space.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
CERN's Large Hadron Collider
consists of a ring 17 miles

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
in circumference,
in which two beams

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:84%
of particles race in
opposite directions,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:84%
converging and smashing together
at nearly the speed of light.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Scientists observe what comes
out of the violent collisions.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.980 align:middle line:84%
The standard model cannot
account for how particles get

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:90%
their mass.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything appears to
be made of vibration,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
but there is no
thing being vibrated.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It is as if there has been an
invisible dancer, a shadow,

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
dancing hidden in the
ballet of the universe.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:25.670 align:middle line:84%
All the other
dancers have always

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:84%
danced around this
hidden dancer.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:84%
We have observed the
choreography of the dance.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But until now, we could
not see that dancer.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The so-called God
Particle, the properties

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.107 align:middle line:84%
of the base material
of universe,

00:18:47.107 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the heart of all matter,
which would account

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.520 align:middle line:84%
for the unexplained mass
and energy that drives

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:90%
the universe's expansion.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But far from explaining
the nature of the universe,

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
the discovery of the
Higgs boson simply

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:84%
presents an even
greater mystery,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.760 align:middle line:84%
revealing a universe that is
more mysterious than we ever

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
imagined.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Science is approaching the
threshold between consciousness

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
The eye with which we look
at the primordial field

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and the eye with which
the field looks at us

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.675 align:middle line:90%
are one and the same.

00:19:22.675 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.750 align:middle line:84%
The German writer and
luminary Wolfgang Von Goethe

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
said, "The wave is the
primordial phenomenon

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.475 align:middle line:90%
which gave rise to the world."

00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.335 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics is the study
of visible sound.

00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:10%
The word cymatics comes
from the Greek root cyma,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:10%
which means wave or vibration.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:10%
One of the first
Western scientists

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:10%
to seriously study
wave phenomena

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:10%
was Ernst Chladni, a German
musician and physicist

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.090 align:middle line:10%
who lived in the 18th century.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Chladni discovered that when
he spread sand on metal plates

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and then vibrated the
plates with a violin bow,

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
the sand arranged
itself into patterns.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.087 align:middle line:84%
Different geometrical
forms appeared, depending

00:20:31.087 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
on the vibration produced.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Chladni recorded an entire
catalog of these shapes

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and they are referred
to as Chladni figures.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Many of these
patterns can be found

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout the natural
world, such as the markings

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
of the tortoise or the
spot patterns of a leopard.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Studying Chladni patterns,
or cymatic patterns,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:84%
is one secret way in which
high end guitar, violin,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and other instrument makers
determine the sound qualities

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:90%
of the instruments they make.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:10%
Hans Jenny expanded on
Chladni's work in the 1960s,

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:10%
using various fluids and
electronic amplification

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:10%
to generate sound frequencies
and coined the term cymatics.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
If you run simple sine waves
through a dish of water,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
you can see patterns
in the water.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the
frequency of the wave,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.800 align:middle line:84%
different ripple
patterns will appear.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.870 align:middle line:84%
The higher the frequency,
the more complex the pattern.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle line:84%
These forms are
repeatable, not random.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The more you
observe, the more you

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:84%
start to see how
vibration arranges matter

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:84%
into complex forms from
simple repeating waves.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
This water vibration has a
pattern similar to a sunflower.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Simply by changing
the sound frequency,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.935 align:middle line:90%
we get a different pattern.

00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Water is a very
mysterious substance.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It is highly
impressionable, that is

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
it can receive and
hold onto vibration.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Because of its high resonance
capacity and sensitivity

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and an inner
readiness to resonate,

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
the water responds
instantaneously

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:90%
to all types of sonic waves.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Vibrating water and earth
make up the majority of mass

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:90%
in plants and animals.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It is easy to observe how
simple vibrations in water

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:84%
can create recognizable,
natural patterns.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But as we add solids and
increase the amplitude,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:middle line:84%
things get even
more interesting.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Adding cornstarch to water,
we get more complex phenomena.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the principles
of life itself

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:84%
can be observed as vibrations
move the cornstarch

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.905 align:middle line:84%
blob into what appears
to be a moving organism.

00:24:05.905 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
The animating principle
of the universe

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is described in
every major religion,

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.320 align:middle line:84%
using words that reflect
the understanding

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.490 align:middle line:90%
of that time in history.

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
In the language of the
Incas, the largest empire

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:84%
in pre-Colombian America,
the word for human body

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
is alpa camasca, which means
literally, animated earth.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, or
Jewish mysticism,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the
divine name of God,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:90%
the name that cannot be spoken.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be spoken, because
it is a vibration that is

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It is all words, all matter.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:00.050 align:middle line:10%
Everything is the secret word.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:84%
The tetrahedron is the
simplest shape that

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.930 align:middle line:90%
can exist in three dimensions.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Something must have
at least four points

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to have physical reality.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
The triangle
structure is nature's

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:90%
only self-stabilizing pattern.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament,
the word tetragrammaton

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.770 align:middle line:84%
was often used to represent a
certain manifestation of God.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It was used when talking
about the word of God

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.775 align:middle line:84%
or the special name of God,
logos or primordial word.

00:25:27.775 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The ancient
civilizations knew that

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
at the root structure
of the universe

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.320 align:middle line:90%
was the tetrahedral shape.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Out of this shape, nature
exhibits a fundamental drive

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:84%
toward equilibrium,
Shiva, while it also

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.440 align:middle line:84%
has a fundamental drive
towards change, Shakti.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, the Gospel
of John usually reads,

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:90%
"In the beginning was THE WORD."

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.075 align:middle line:84%
But in the original text
, the term used was logos.

00:26:05.075 --> 00:26:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The Greek philosopher,
Heraclitus,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
who lived around 500
years before Christ,

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:84%
referred to the logos as
something fundamentally

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.575 align:middle line:84%
unknowable, the origin of all
repetition, pattern, and form.

00:26:19.575 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
The stoic philosophers
who followed

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.850 align:middle line:84%
the teachings of Heraclitus
identified the term

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
with the divine
animating principle

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:90%
pervading the universe.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
In Sufism, the logos is
everywhere and in all things.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It is that out of which the
unmanifest becomes manifest.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu tradition,
Shiva Nataraja literally

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%
means Lord of the Dance.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:84%
The whole cosmos
dances to Shiva's drum.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:84%
All is imbued, or insoled,
with the pulsation.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Only as long as Shiva
is dancing can the world

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:90%
continue to evolve and change.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.018 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it collapses
back into nothingness.

00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:19.090 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.260 align:middle line:10%
While Shiva is representative
of our witnessing consciousness,

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:10%
Shakti is the substance,
or stuff, of the world.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:10%
While Shiva lies in meditation,
Shakti he tries to move him,

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:10%
to bring him into the dance.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:38.755 align:middle line:10%
Like yin and yang, the dancer
and the dance exist as one.

00:27:38.755 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Logos also means
unconcealed truth.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
He who knows the
logos, knows the truth.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Many layers of concealment
exist in the human world,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
as Akasha has been swirled
into complex structures,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.360 align:middle line:84%
concealing the
source from itself.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Like a divine game
of hide and seek,

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
we have been hiding
for thousands of years,

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.660 align:middle line:84%
eventually forgetting
about the game completely.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We somehow forgot that
there was anything to find.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, one is taught
to directly perceive

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.600 align:middle line:84%
the logos, the field of
change or impermanence

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
within oneself
through meditation.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.210 align:middle line:10%
When you observe
your inner world,

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:10%
you observe subtler and
subtler sensations and energies

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:10%
as the mind becomes more
concentrated and focused.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:10%
Through the direct realization
of Anicha, or impermanence,

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:10%
at the root level of sensation,
one becomes free of attachment

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:10%
to transient external forms.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Once we realize there is
one vibratory field that

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
is the common root
of all religions,

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:84%
how can we say my religion
or this is my primordial om,

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.045 align:middle line:90%
my quantum field?

00:29:03.045 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The true crisis in our world
is not social, political,

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.180 align:middle line:90%
or economic.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Our crisis is a crisis of
consciousness and inability

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:84%
to directly experience our
true nature, an inability

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:45.630 align:middle line:84%
to recognize this nature in
everyone and in all things.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:53.510 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
In the Buddhist
tradition, the bodhisattva

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is a person with an
awakened Buddha nature.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.600 align:middle line:84%
A bodhisattva vows
to help to awaken

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.280 align:middle line:84%
every being in the universe,
realizing that there

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.130 align:middle line:90%
is only one consciousness.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.985 align:middle line:84%
To awaken one's true self,
one must awaken all beings.

00:30:12.985 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:24.550 align:middle line:84%
There are innumerable sentient
beings in the universe.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I vow to help them
all to awaken.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:84%
My imperfections
are inexhaustible.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:90%
I vow to overcome them all.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.920 align:middle line:90%
The Dharma is unknowable.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I vow to know it.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.415 align:middle line:84%
The way of awakening
is unattainable.

00:30:43.415 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:90%
I vow to attain it.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:31:00.822 align:middle line:90%
