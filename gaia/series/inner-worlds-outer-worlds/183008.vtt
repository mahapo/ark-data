00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We live our lives pursuing
happiness out there

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.240 align:middle line:90%
as if it is a commodity.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
We've become slaves to our
own desires and craving.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is not something
that can be pursued or purchase

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:90%
like a cheap suit.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.175 align:middle line:84%
This is maya, illusion,

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
In the Buddhist tradition,
samsara, or the endless cycle

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of suffering, is perpetuated
by the craving of pleasure

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and aversion to pain.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Freud referred to this as
the pleasure principle.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do is an
attempt to create pleasure,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to gain something that we
want, or to push away something

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%
undesirable that we don't want.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Even a simple organism like
the Paramecium does this.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:84%
It is called
response to stimulus.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Unlike a Paramecium,
humans have more choice.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.760 align:middle line:90%
We are free to think.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
heart of the problem.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It is the thinking
about what we want

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:90%
that has gotten out of control.

>> The dilemma of modern society
is that we seek to understand

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
the world not in terms of
archaic inner consciousness,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
but by quantifying and
qualifying what we perceive

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to be the external world
by using scientific means

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and thought.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Thinking has only led to more
thinking and more questions.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We seek to know the innermost
forces which create the world

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and guide its course,
but we conceive

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
of this essence as
outside of ourselves,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
not as a living thing
intrinsic to our own nature.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.600 align:middle line:84%
It was the famous psychiatrist
Carl Jung who said,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
"One who looks outside, dreams.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:90%
One who looks inside, awakes."

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It is not wrong to desire
to be awake, to be happy.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.140 align:middle line:84%
What is wrong is to look
for happiness outside when

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:90%
it can only be found inside.

Tahoe, California, Eric
Schmidt, CEO of Google,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:84%
mentioned an
astounding statistic.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Every two days now, we
create as much information

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
as we did from the dawn of
civilization up until 2003,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:90%
according to Schmidt.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
That's something like
5 exabytes of data.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Never in human history has
there been so much thinking,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and never has there been so
much turmoil on the planet.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
every time we think

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:84%
of a solution to one problem,
we create two more problems?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:84%
What good is all this
thinking if it doesn't

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
lead to greater happiness?

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Are we happier, more equanimous,
more joyful as a result

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
of all this thinking?

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Or does it isolate
us, disconnect us

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
from a deeper and more
meaningful experience of life?

from the spiral of
life, the law change,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%

TV show streaming from
every conceivable device,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:10%
games and puzzles,
text messaging,

and every possible
trivial thing.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We let ourselves
become mesmerized

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
with the endless stream of
new images, new information,

our hearts may

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:10%
is more to life than our
present reality, that we live

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:10%
in a world of hungry ghosts,
endlessly craving and never

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:10%
satisfied.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We have created a maelstrom of
data flying around the planet

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate more thinking,
more ideas about how

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
to fix the world, to
fix the problems that

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
only exist because the
mind has created them.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Thinking has created
the whole big mess

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:90%
that we are in right now.

The paradox is that whatever
you resist persists.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
The more you resist something,
the stronger it gets.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Like exercising a

In Buddhism, you are not the

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.340 align:middle line:84%
You are not merely a
collection of thoughts or ideas

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:84%
because behind the
thoughts is the one who

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.805 align:middle line:90%

people are looking for
the meaning of life

I am awake.

exactly because the flowering

of each individual
life is different.

It is the end of suffering.

once your mind is quiet.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.940 align:middle line:84%
In that stillness,
inner energies

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:84%
wake up and work without
effort on your part.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
As the daoists say, chi
follows consciousness.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
By being still,
one begins to hear

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.905 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of the plants and
animals, the quiet whispers

00:11:01.905 --> 00:11:02.705 align:middle line:90%
in dreams.

00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And one learns the subtle
mechanism by which those dreams

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:90%
come into material form.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
In the Daodejing, this kind of
living is called wei wu wei--

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:90%
doing, not doing.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.580 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha spoke
of the middle way

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:84%
as the path that leads
to enlightenment.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle described
the golden mean,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
the middle between two
extremes, as the path of beauty,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.610 align:middle line:84%
not too much effort, but
not too little either.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.365 align:middle line:90%
Yin and yang in perfect balance.

00:11:41.365 --> 00:11:50.392 align:middle line:90%

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Pedantist notion of
maya, or illusion,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle line:84%
is that we do not experience the
environment itself, but rather

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
a projection of it
created by thoughts.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, your thoughts let you
experience the vibratory world

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But our inner
equanimity need not

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
be contingent on
external happenings.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The belief in an external
world independent

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
of the perceiving subject
is fundamental to science.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But our senses only give
us indirect information.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Our notions about this
mind-made physical world

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:84%
are always filtered
through the senses

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:90%
and therefore always incomplete.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
There is one field of vibration
underlying all of the senses.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:10%
People with a condition
called synesthesia sometimes

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.980 align:middle line:10%
experience this vibratory
field in different ways.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Synesthetes can see
sounds as colors or shapes

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
or associate qualities of
one sense with another.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.005 align:middle line:84%
Synesthesia refers to a
synthesis or intermingling

00:13:09.005 --> 00:13:09.805 align:middle line:90%
of the senses.

00:13:09.805 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The chakras in the
senses are like a prison,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
filtering a continuum
of vibration.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
All things in the
universe are vibrating

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but at different
rates and frequencies.

The Eye of Horus is
made up of six symbols,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:90%
each representing the senses.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Like the ancient
Vedic system, thought

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.255 align:middle line:90%
is considered to be a sense.

00:13:38.255 --> 00:13:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts are received
simultaneously

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:84%
as sensations are
experienced on the body.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They arise from the
same vibratory source.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Thinking is simply a
tool, one of six senses.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But we have elevated it
to such a high status

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that we identify ourselves
with our thoughts.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
do not recognize

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.720 align:middle line:84%
thinking as one of the sixth
senses is very significant.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
We are so immersed in thought
that trying to explain

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.870 align:middle line:84%
thought as a sense is like
telling a fish about water.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Water.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:90%
What water?

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:10%
In the Upanishads, it is said
not that which the eye can see,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:10%
but that whereby
the eye can see.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:10%
Know that to be
Brahman the eternal,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.310 align:middle line:10%
and not what people here adore.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:10%
Not that which the ear
can hear, but that whereby

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:10%
the ear can hear.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.760 align:middle line:10%

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:10%
Not that which speech can
illuminate, but that by which

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:10%
speech can be illuminated.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Know that to be
Brahman the eternal,

In the last decade,
great advances

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
have taken place in the
area of brain research.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have discovered
neuroplasticity,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:84%
a term which conveys the
idea that the physical wiring

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
of the brain changes according
to the thoughts moving

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:90%
through it.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:10%
As Canadian psychologist
Donald Hebb put it,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:10%
"Neurons that fire
together wire together."

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Neurons wire together
most when a person

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is in a state of
sustained attention.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that
it is possible to direct

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:84%
your own subjective
experience of reality.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Literally, if your thoughts are
ones of fear, worry, anxiety,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and negativity, then you
grow the wiring for more

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:90%
of those thoughts to flourish.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
If you direct your thoughts
to be ones of love,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:02.680 align:middle line:84%
compassion, gratitude, and
joy, you create the wiring

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:90%
for repeating those experiences.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But how do we do that
if we are surrounded

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:90%
by violence and suffering?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this some kind of
delusion or wishful thinking?

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity is not the
same as the new age notion

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.545 align:middle line:84%
that you create your reality
by positive thinking.

00:17:22.545 --> 00:17:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It is actually the same
thing that the Buddha

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:30.230 align:middle line:90%

Vipassana meditation,
or insight meditation,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
can be described as
self-directed neuroplasticity.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
You accept your reality exactly
as it is, as it actually is.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
But you experience it at
the root level of sensation,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
at the vibratory
or energetic level,

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.200 align:middle line:84%
without the prejudice
or influence

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
of thought through sustained
attention at the root

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

The wiring for an entirely
different perception of reality

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:90%

We've got it backwards
most of the time.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.570 align:middle line:10%
shape our neural networks.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But our inner
equanimity need not

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
be contingent on
external happenings.

Only my state of
consciousness matters.

Meditation in Sanskrit means
to be free of measurement,

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
free of all comparison, to
be free of all becoming.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:84%

The way to rise above the
suffering of the physical realm

is to totally embrace
it, to say yes

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.560 align:middle line:84%
to it so it becomes something
within you, rather than you

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:90%
being something with it.

How does one empty the

There must be a total
revolution in consciousness,

a radical shift in orientation

to the inner.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:10%
It is not a revolution brought
about by will or effort

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.465 align:middle line:10%
alone, but also by surrender,
acceptance of reality as it is.

The image of Christ's
open heart powerfully

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
conveys the idea that one
must open to all pain.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
One must accept all

reality as it is, instead

Sri Ramana Maharishi said,
"God dwells in you, as you,

to the one self radiating

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
This force of change is the

Everything is arising and
