00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pythagorean philosopher
Plato hinted, enigmatically,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that there was a golden key that
unified all of the mysteries

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It is this golden key that we
will return to time and again

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:90%
throughout our exploration.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.790 align:middle line:84%
The golden key is
the intelligence

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of the logos, the source
of the primordial om.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:84%
One could say that it
is the mind of God.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.050 align:middle line:84%
With our limited
senses, we are observing

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:84%
only the outer manifestation
of the hidden mechanics

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:90%
of self-similarity.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
The source of this
divine symmetry

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest mystery
of our existence.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Many of history's
monumental thinkers,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
such as Pythagoras, Kepler,
Leonardo da Vinci, Tesla,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and Einstein have come to
the threshold of the mystery.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, "The
most beautiful thing

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
we can experience
is the mysterious.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the source of all
true art and science.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
He to whom this emotion
is a stranger, who

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
can no longer pause to wonder
and stand wrapped in awe

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:90%
is as good as dead.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:90%
His eyes are closed."

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:84%
We are in the position of
a little child entering

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
a huge library filled with books
in many different languages.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
The child knows someone
must've written those books.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:90%
It does not know how.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It does not understand
the languages

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:90%
in which they are written.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
The child dimly suspects
a mysterious order

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
in the arrangement of the books,
but doesn't know what it is.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.520 align:middle line:84%
That, it seems to
me, is the attitude

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of even the most intelligent
human being toward God.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
We see a universe
marvelously arranged

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
and obeying certain laws.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Our limited minds cannot grasp
the mysterious force that moves

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:90%
the constellations.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Every scientist who looks
deeply into the universe

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and every mystic who looks
deeply within the self,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
eventually comes face to
face with the same thing,

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.645 align:middle line:90%
the primordial spiral.

00:02:27.645 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
A thousand years
before the creation

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient observatory
at Stonehenge, the spiral

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
was a predominant
symbol on Earth.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:10%
Ancient spirals can be found
in all parts of the globe.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.460 align:middle line:10%
Thousands of ancient
spirals, such as these,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:10%
can be found all over Europe
and North American New Mexico,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:10%
Utah, Australia, China,
Russia, virtually

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:10%
every indigenous
culture on Earth.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:10%


00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.990 align:middle line:10%
The ancient spiral
symbolized growth, expansion,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and cosmic energy.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:10%
Embodied within the
sun and the heavens,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.750 align:middle line:10%
the spiral form is mirroring
the macrocosm of the unfolding

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:10%
universe itself.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:10%
In native traditions, the
spiral was the energetic source,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.895 align:middle line:10%
the primordial mother.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:10%
The Neolithic spirals
at Newgrange, Ireland

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:10%
date back 5,000 years.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.270 align:middle line:84%
They are 500 years older than
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And they are just as
enigmatic to modern observers.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:84%
The spiral goes back
to a time in history

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
when humans were more
connected to the Earth,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.610 align:middle line:84%
to the cycles and
spirals of nature,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
a time when humans were less
identified with thoughts.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The spiral is what
we perceive to be

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:90%
the torque of the universe.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Prana, or creative
force, swirls Akasha

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:90%
into a continuum of solid forms.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Found at all levels between
the macrocosm and microcosm,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
from spiral galaxies
to weather systems

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to the water in your
bathtub to your DNA

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
to the direct experience
of your own energy.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:84%
The primordial spiral is
not an idea, but rather

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that which makes all
conditions and ideas possible.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.375 align:middle line:84%
Various types of
spirals and helices

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
are found throughout
the natural world.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.880 --> 00:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Snails, sea coral,
spiderwebs, fossils,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.135 align:middle line:90%
seahorses' tails, and shells.

00:06:11.135 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Many spirals appearing
in nature are

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
observable as logarithmic
spirals, or growth spirals.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.890 align:middle line:10%
As you move out from the
center, the spiral sections

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.195 align:middle line:10%
get exponentially larger.

00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Like Indra's Net of
Jewels, logarithmic spirals

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
are self-similar,
or holographic, such

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
that the characteristics
of every part

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:90%
are reflected in the whole.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:10%
2,400 years ago
in ancient Greece,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:10%
Plato considered continuous
geometric proportion

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:10%
to be the most
profound cosmic bond.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:84%
The golden ratio or
divine proportion

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:90%
was nature's greatest secret.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
The golden ratio
can be expressed

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:84%
as the ratio of A plus B to A
is the same as the ratio of A

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to B. To Plato, the
world's soul binds together

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.890 align:middle line:90%
into one harmonic resonance.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
The same pentagonal pattern
that exists in a starfish

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:84%
or in a slice of
okra can be seen

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
in the path of the planet
Venus, traced in the night

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.180 align:middle line:90%
sky over an eight year period.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:47.258 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.090 align:middle line:10%
The intelligible
world of forms above

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:10%
and the visible world of
material objects below,

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:10%
through this principle of
geometric self-similarity.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.900 align:middle line:84%
From the self similar
spiral patterns

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Romanesco broccoli
to the arms of galaxies,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.170 align:middle line:84%
logarithmic spirals are a
ubiquitous and archetypal

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Our own Milky Way galaxy
has several spiral arms,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:84%
which are logarithmic
spirals with a pitch of about

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.550 align:middle line:90%
12 degrees.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.685 align:middle line:84%
The greater the pitch of the
spiral, the tighter the turns.

00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
When you observe a plant
growing in time lapse video,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
you witness it dancing
with the spiral of life.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
A golden spiral is
a logarithmic spiral

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:84%
that grows outward by a
factor of the golden ratio.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The golden ratio is a special
mathematical relationship

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that pops up over
and over in nature.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.300 align:middle line:84%
The pattern that is
observable follows

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
what is called the Fibonacci
series, or Fibonacci sequence.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The Fibonacci
series unfolds, such

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that each number is the sum
of the previous two numbers.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:10%
The German mathematician
and astronomer Kepler

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:10%
discovered that
self-similar spiral patterns

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:10%
are observable in the way leaves
are arranged on stems of plants

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.230 align:middle line:10%
or in the florate and petal
arrangements of flowers.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci observed
that the spacing of leaves

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.030 align:middle line:90%
was often in spiral patterns.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
These patterns are called
phyllotaxis patterns

00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:90%
or leaf arrangement patterns.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Phyllotaxis arrangements
can be seen in self

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:90%
organizing DNA nucleotides.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:10%
And in everything from the
family trees of reproducing

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:10%
rabbits to pine cones,
cacti to snowflakes,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.760 align:middle line:10%
and in simple organisms,
such as diatoms.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Diatoms are one of
the most common types

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
of phytoplankton,
single-celled organisms

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.827 align:middle line:84%
that provide food
for countless species

00:10:37.827 --> 00:10:38.910 align:middle line:90%
throughout the food chain.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:11:05.535 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.535 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:10%
How much math do
you need to know

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:10%
to be a sunflower or a bee?

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Nature doesn't consult a physics
department to grow broccoli.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The structuring in nature
happens automatically.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Scientists in the
field of nanotechnology

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
use the term
self-assembly to describe

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the way complexes
are formed, such as

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
in the initial hexagonal
phase of DNA formation.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
In nanotechnology
engineering, carbon nanotubes

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
are comprised of a similar
arrangement of materials.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Nature does this type of
geometry over and over,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
effortlessly, automatically,
without a calculator.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Nature is precise and
extremely efficient.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.490 align:middle line:10%
According to the famous
architect and author,

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Buckminster Fuller,
these patterns

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:10%
are a function of time space.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
DNA and honeycomb are
the shape that they

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:84%
are for the same reason
a bubble is round.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the most efficient
shape, requiring

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%
the least amount of energy.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Space itself has
shape and allows

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.890 align:middle line:84%
only certain configurations
for matter, always defaulting

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.657 align:middle line:90%
to what is most efficient.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.190 align:middle line:84%
These patterns are the
strongest and most efficient way

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to build architectural
structures,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:90%
such as geodesic domes.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:41.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Logarithmic spiral patterns
allow plants maximum exposure

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:84%
to insects for pollination,
maximum exposure to sunlight

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and rain, and allow them
to efficiently spiral

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.975 align:middle line:90%
water towards their roots.

00:12:56.975 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Birds of prey use the
logarithmic spiral pattern

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:90%
to stalk their next meal.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Flying in a spiral is the
most efficient way to hunt.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:84%
One's ability to see the
spiral of life dancing Akasha

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:84%
into material form is
related to one's ability

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.515 align:middle line:84%
to see beauty and
symmetry in nature.

00:13:32.515 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Poet William Blake said,
"The vegetative universe

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
opens like a flower from
the Earth's center in which

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%
is eternity.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It expands from stars
to the mundane shell.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And there, it meets
eternity again,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:90%
both within and without."

00:13:53.660 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The study of patterns
and nature is not

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
something that is very
familiar in the West.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But in ancient China, this
science was known as Li.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Li reflects the dynamic
order and pattern in nature.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But it is not pattern thought
of as something static, frozen,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:90%
or unchanging, like a mosaic.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.605 align:middle line:84%
Its dynamic pattern is
embodied in all living things.

00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:43.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
The arteries of leaves, the
markings of the tortoise,

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and the vein patterns on
rocks are all expressions

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
of nature's secret
language and art.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
The labyrinth is one
of many Li patterns.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It is found in coral
structures, mushrooms

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:13.832 align:middle line:84%
like the morel, cabbages,
and in the human brain.

00:15:13.832 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.825 align:middle line:84%
The cellular pattern is
another common form in nature.

00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:84%
There are a myriad of
different cellular structures,

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
but all have a similar
orderliness defined

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:90%
by their purpose and function.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It is easy to be mesmerized
with a constant play of forms,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
but what is most interesting is
that certain archetypal forms

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
seem to be woven into the
fabric of nature at all.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:84%
The branching pattern
is another Li pattern,

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.540 align:middle line:84%
or archetypal pattern, that
is observable at all levels

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and all fractal scales.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example,
this incredible image

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of a supercomputer simulation
known as the Millennium Run,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.190 align:middle line:84%
showing the distribution of dark
matter in the local universe.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It was created by the Max
Planck Society in Germany.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Dark matter is essentially
what we previously

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:90%
thought of as empty space.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It is like an invisible
nervous system that

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:90%
runs throughout the universe.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
The universe is literally
like a giant brain.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:84%
It is constantly thinking, using
a type of dark or hidden energy

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that science is only
starting to understand.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.599 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:10%
Through this immense
network, unfathomable energy

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:10%
moves, providing the momentum
for the expansion and growth

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Nature creates branching
patterns automatically,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
when we set up the
right conditions.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Nature is an
art-generating machine

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
or a beauty-creating engine.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Here, electricity is being
used to grow silver crystal

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:90%
branches.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
The footage is time lapsed as
they grow over several hours.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The crystals form on
the aluminum cathode

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
as ions are electro deposited
from a silver nitrate solution.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.382 align:middle line:84%
The formation is
self-organizing.

00:18:17.382 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
You are seeing artwork
generated by nature itself.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Johann Wolfgang Von
Goethe said, "Beauty

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.935 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation of
secret, natural laws, which

00:18:30.935 --> 00:18:32.935 align:middle line:84%
otherwise would've been
hidden from us forever."

00:18:32.935 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
In this sense,
everything in nature

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:90%
is alive, self-organizing.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.190 align:middle line:84%
When higher voltage is
used, the fractal branching

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:90%
becomes even more obvious.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:90%
This is happening in real time.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
In the human body, tree-like
structures and patterns

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.172 align:middle line:90%
are found throughout.

00:19:28.172 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
There are, of course,
the nervous systems

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that Western
medicine knows about.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
But in Chinese, ayurvedic,
and Tibetan medicine,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:84%
the energy meridians
are a central component

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to understanding how
the body functions.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The nadis, or energy meridians,
form tree-like structures.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
A post-mortem
examination will not

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
reveal the chakras or the
nadis, but that does not

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:90%
mean they do not exist.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.170 align:middle line:84%
You need to refine your
tool that you use to look.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
You must first learn
to quiet your own mind.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.625 align:middle line:84%
Only then, you will
observe these things first

00:20:04.625 --> 00:20:05.425 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.080 align:middle line:84%
In electrical theory, the
less resistance in a wire,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:84%
the more easily you
can carry energy.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:84%
When you cultivate equanimity
through meditation,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
it creates a state of
nonresistance in your body.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Prana or qi or inner energy is
simply your inner aliveness,

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
what you feel when you
bring your consciousness

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The subtle wires within
your body that carry prana,

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:84%
the nadis, become able to move
more and more Prana energy

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:90%
through the chakras.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Your wiring becomes
stronger as you use it,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.135 align:middle line:90%
as you allow energy to flow.

00:20:47.135 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Wherever consciousness
is placed,

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.195 align:middle line:84%
qi or energy will begin to
flow and physical connections

00:20:56.195 --> 00:20:56.995 align:middle line:90%
blossom.

00:20:56.995 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Within the brain
and nervous system,

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
physical wiring patterns become
established by repetition.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:84%
By continually placing your
attention within and lowering

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
resistance to the sensations
you are experiencing,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
you increase your
energetic capacity.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.670 align:middle line:84%
In Daoism, the yin
yang symbol represents

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.780 align:middle line:84%
the inter penetration of
the spiral forces of nature.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The yin yang is not
two and not one.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:10%
The ancient concept
of the hara is

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:10%
represented by a yin
yang or a spiral swirl.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It is the power center located
in the valley below the navel.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Hara means, literally,
sea or ocean of energy.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.980 align:middle line:84%
In China, the hara is
called the lower dance yin.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In many forms of
Asian martial arts,

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.400 align:middle line:84%
the warrior with strong hara
is said to be unstoppable.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
In the samurai
tradition, one form

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:23.210 align:middle line:84%
of ritual suicide, or
seppuku, was hara-kiri,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:84%
was often mispronounced
as harry carry.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It means to impale one's
hara, thereby cutting off

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.255 align:middle line:90%
one's qi or energy channel.

00:22:32.255 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:10%
Moving from this center creates
the grounded, graceful movement

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:10%
that you see not
only in martial arts,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:10%
but in great golfers, belly
dancers, and Sufi whirling

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:10%
dervishes.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
It is the cultivation of
single-pointed, disciplined

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.660 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
That is the essence
of hara, the stillness

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:90%
in the eye of the hurricane.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the gut instinct
and connection

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.435 align:middle line:90%
to one's energy source.

00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
A person with good hara
is connected to the earth

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and to the intuitive wisdom
that connects all beings.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:10%
To think with your
belly, hara de kangaeru,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:10%
is to tap into
your inner wisdom.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The ancient
Australian aborigines

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
concentrated on the same
area, just below the navel,

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
where the cord of the great
rainbow serpent lay coiled.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Again, a representation
of the evolutionary energy

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:90%
in humankind.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It is no accident that it is in
the hara where new life begins.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The enteric nervous system,
sometimes referred to

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
as the gut brain, is
capable of maintaining

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
a complex matrix of connections,
similar to the brain

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
in the head, with its own
neurons and neurotransmitters.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It can act autonomously, that
is with its own intelligence.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:84%
You could say that the gut
brain is a fractal version

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:90%
of the head brain.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps the head brain
is a fractal version

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:90%
of the gut brain.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:90%
A healthy bear has strong hara.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
When a bear knows where
to forage for herbs,

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.290 align:middle line:84%
it follows the movement
of qi through its senses,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:90%
centered in the hara, or belly.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the bear's connection
to the dream lodge, the place

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
in native traditions
where all knowledge comes

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:90%
from to the spiral of life.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But how did ancient peoples
know about the spiral,

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:84%
if modern science
is just now starting

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:90%
to recognize its significance?

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Ask the bees, for they have
not forgotten how to love.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Bees have a special
connection to the source,

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:84%
as part of a symbiotic system
helping beauty and diversity

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:90%
to flourish.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:84%
They are a bridge between
the macrocosm and microcosm.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
There is one heart that connects
all, a hive mind, if you will.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Like an open brain, the
hive sends out its dreams

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:90%
into the world to be manifested.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.360 align:middle line:84%
In nature, many
creatures know how

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
to act in unison, to move with
one spirit, one direction.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:27:42.490 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But not all benefit the
other species around them.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, the locust will
devour everything in its path.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
A locust has no choice
but to act like a locust.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It will never make honey
or pollinate plants the way

00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.800 align:middle line:90%
a bee does.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.220 align:middle line:84%
A locust's behavior
is rigid, but a human

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
is unique, in that
we can act like a bee

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:90%
or we can act like a locust.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.920 align:middle line:84%
We are free to
change and manipulate

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.080 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of how we
interact with the world.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We can exist symbiotically
or as a parasite.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Today, humans try to
understand the spiral

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.480 align:middle line:90%
with the rational mind.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was never thinking
that connected us

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:90%
to the spiral of life.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.277 align:middle line:90%
We have always been connected.

00:28:52.277 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Thinking has been what keeps us
in the illusion of separateness

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.520 align:middle line:90%
within our own identities.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Thinking is the creation
of separateness,

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:90%
the experience of limitation.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The more we align
with thought, the more

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
removed we become
from the source.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures that
were less thought-oriented

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:84%
align themselves with the spiral
in a more direct and personal

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:90%
way than we do today.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.910 align:middle line:84%
In ancient India, Kundalini
is a representation

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:84%
of one's inner
energy, which moves

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
in snake-like or helix-like
pattern up the spine.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.250 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Yogic
traditions of India,

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
the inner worlds of
people at that time

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
were comparable to those
of hara-centered cultures.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:10%
To balance the power of
the spiral with a stillness

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.470 align:middle line:10%
of your witnessing
consciousness is

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.860 align:middle line:10%
to align with your full
evolutionary potential,

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.630 align:middle line:10%
to blossom into the unique
multifaceted being you

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:10%
were designed to be.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:07.370 align:middle line:84%
The feminine, or
moon channel, is

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.010 align:middle line:90%
connected to the right brain.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And pingala, the
masculine or sun channel,

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.540 align:middle line:90%
connected to the left brain.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.810 align:middle line:84%
When these two channels
are in balance,

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
energy flows up a third
channel, sushumna,

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.600 align:middle line:84%
along the center of the
spine, energizing the chakras

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and unlocking one's
evolutionary potential.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The word chakra is an
ancient Sanskrit word,

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.270 align:middle line:90%
meaning energy wheel.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is nothing less
than the primordial spiral

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.635 align:middle line:84%
that dances your human
life into existence.

00:30:49.635 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It is a different
order of energy

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:84%
than we normally understand,
like a bridge from gross matter

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to the most subtle energies.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.610 align:middle line:90%
You are that bridge.

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is not energy that
can be forced by will, effort,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:90%
and friction.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It is analogous to
growing a flower.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.020 align:middle line:84%
All we can do as
good gardeners is

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.735 align:middle line:84%
prepare the soil in proper
conditions and let nature

00:31:14.735 --> 00:31:15.535 align:middle line:90%
take its course.

00:31:15.535 --> 00:31:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:84%
If you force a flower
to open prematurely,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.600 align:middle line:90%
you will destroy it.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:84%
It grows with its
own intelligence,

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
with its own
self-organizing direction.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The egoic mind, which
fixates on the outer world,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.240 align:middle line:84%
is what keeps you
from experiencing

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.390 align:middle line:84%
your true inner
vibratory nature.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:84%
When consciousness
is turned within,

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.260 align:middle line:90%
it becomes like the sun's rays.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And the Lotus within
begins to grow.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:84%
As Kundalini awakens
within oneself,

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:84%
one begins to see the signature
of the spiral in all things,

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
in all patterns
within and without.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:84%
This spiral is the link
between our inner worlds

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:90%
and our outer worlds.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:43.926 align:middle line:90%
