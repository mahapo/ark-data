[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Prior to the dawn of Western
civilization and written

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.345 align:middle line:84%
language, science and
spirituality were not two

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:10.145 align:middle line:90%
separate things.

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:13.412 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:16.790 align:middle line:10%
In the teachings of the
great ancient traditions,

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.100 align:middle line:10%
the outer search for
knowledge and certainty

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.520 align:middle line:10%
was balanced by an inner feeling
of impermanence and intuitive

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:10%
understanding of the
spiral of change.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:84%
As scientific thinking became
more dominant and information

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:84%
multiplied, fragmentation began
to occur within our knowledge

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.810 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Increased specialization
meant that fewer people

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.510 align:middle line:84%
were capable of seeing the
big picture, of feeling

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and intuiting the aesthetic
of the system as a whole.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:84%
No one was asking, is all
this thinking good for us?

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
The ancient knowledge
is here in our midst,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:90%
hidden in plain view.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But we are too preoccupied with
our thoughts to recognize it.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
This forgotten wisdom
is the way to restore

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
the balance between the
inner and the outer,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
yin and yang, between
the spiral of change

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and the stillness at our core.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.707 align:middle line:84%
In Greek legend, Asclepius
was the son of Apollo

00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:56.665 align:middle line:90%
and the god of healing.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
His wisdom and skills in
healing were unsurpassed,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
and he is said to have
discovered the secret of life

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and death itself.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Greece, the
Asclepian healing temples

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:84%
recognized the power of
the primordial spiral,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
which is symbolized by
the Rod of Asclepius.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates, the Father of
Medicine, whose oath still

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
forms the moral code of
the medical profession,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
was said to have received
his training at an Asclepian

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:90%
temple.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
To this day, this symbol
of our evolutionary energy

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
remains as the logo for
the American Medical

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Association and other medical
organizations worldwide.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian iconography,
the snake and bird

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.435 align:middle line:84%
represent the duality or
polarity of human nature.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
The snake, the
downward direction,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:84%
is the manifested spiral,
the evolutionary energy

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:10%
The bird is the
upward direction,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:10%
the upward current
oriented towards the sun,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:10%
or awakened, single-pointed
consciousness,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.405 align:middle line:10%
the emptiness of Akasha.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Pharaohs and gods are depicted
with awakened energy, whereby

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the Kundalini snake
moves up the spine

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and pierces Ajna Chakra
between the eyes.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
This is referred to
as the Eye of Horus.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu
tradition, the bindi

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
is also representative
of a third eye,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:90%
the divine connection to spirit.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
King Tutankhamun's mask is
a classic example showing

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.700 align:middle line:90%
both a snake and bird motifs.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan and Aztec traditions
combine the serpent and bird

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.370 align:middle line:90%
motif into one god--

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Quetzalcoatl, or Kukulkan--
the winged serpent god

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
represents the awakened
evolutionary consciousness,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:90%
or awakened Kundalini.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The person who awakens
Quetzalcoatl within themselves

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is a living manifestation
of the divine.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
It is said that Quetzalcoatl,
or "serpent energy,"

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
shall return at the end of time.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
The snake and bird symbols can
be found within Christianity

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.120 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Their true meaning may
be more deeply encrypted,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
but the meaning is the same as
in other ancient traditions.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity,
the bird or dove

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
often seen above Christ
head represents Holy Spirit,

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
or Kundalini Shakti, as it rises
to the Sixth Chakra and beyond.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The Christian mystics called
Kundalini by another name--

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Holy Spirit.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:10%
In John 3:12, it says,
"And as Moses lifted up

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:10%
the serpent in the wilderness,
so must the son of man

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:10%
be lifted up."

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Jesus and Moses awaken
their Kundalini energy,

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:10%
bringing awakened consciousness
to the unconscious reptilian

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:10%
forces that drive human craving.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was said to have
spent 40 days and nights

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:84%
in the desert, during which
time he was tempted by Satan.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, the Buddha
was tempted by Mara

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.915 align:middle line:84%
as he sat to reach enlightenment
under the Bodhi Tree, or wisdom

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle line:90%
tree.

00:06:21.715 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Both Christ and Buddha
had to turn away

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.530 align:middle line:84%
from the lure of sensory
pleasures and worldly grasping.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
In each story, the demon
is the personification

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of one's own attachments.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:10%
If we read the
Adam and Eve story

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:10%
in the light of the Vedic
and Egyptian traditions,

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:10%
we find that the serpent
guarding the Tree of Life

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:10%
is Kundalini.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The apple represents
the lure and temptation

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
of the external sensory
world, distracting us

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
from the knowledge of the inner
world, the Tree of Knowledge

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The tree is simply the network
of nadis, or energy meridians,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves which literally
form tree-like structures

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:90%
throughout the body.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
In our egoic quest for
external gratification,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
we have cut ourselves
off from the knowledge

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of the inner world, our
connection to Akasha

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:90%
and the wisdom source.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:06.800 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Many of the world's
historical myths about dragons

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
can be read as metaphors for the
inner energies of the cultures

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:90%
in which they are embedded.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
In China, the dragon is
still a sacred symbol

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.640 align:middle line:90%
representing happiness.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Like the Egyptian pharaohs,
ancient Chinese emperors

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
who had awakened their
evolutionary energies

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.249 align:middle line:84%
were represented by the
winged snake or dragon.

00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
The royal totem of the Jade
Emperor, or Celestial Emperor,

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
shows a balance similar
to Ida and Pingala.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The yin and yang of Taoism,
awakening the pineal center,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
or what in Taoism is
called the upper dantian.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Nature is full of
different light detection

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:90%
and assimilation mechanisms.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:84%
For example, a sea
urchin can actually

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:19.540 align:middle line:84%
see with its spiky body,
which acts as one big eye.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Urchins detect light
striking their spines

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and compare the
beams' intensities

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
to get a sense of
their surroundings.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Green iguanas and
other reptiles have

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
a parietal eye, or pineal
gland, on top of their heads,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
which they use to detect
predators from above.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:84%
The human pineal gland is
a small endocrine gland

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:84%
that helps to regulate
waking and sleeping patterns.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Even though it is buried
deep inside the head,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.910 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland is
sensitive to light.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:10%
The philosopher
Descartes recognized

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:10%
that the pineal gland
area, or third eye,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.310 align:middle line:10%
was the interface between
consciousness and matter.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:84%
Almost everything is
symmetrical in the human body--

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:84%
two eyes, two ears, two
nostrils, even the brain

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:90%
has two sides.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
But there is one area of the
brain that is not mirrored--

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
this is the pineal gland
area and the energetic center

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds it.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
On a physical level,
unique molecules

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:84%
are formed naturally by the
pineal gland, such as DMT.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
DMT also forms
naturally at the moment

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
of birth and moment
of death, literally

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:84%
acting as a unique
bridge between the world

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:90%
of the living and the dead.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
DMT is produced
naturally during states

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
of deep meditation and samadhi,
or through entheogenic means.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, ayahuasca is used
in the shamanic traditions

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of South America
to remove the veil

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
between the inner
and outer worlds.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:84%
The word "pineal" itself has
the same root as pine cone

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
because the pineal gland
exhibits a similar spiral

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:90%
phyllotaxis pattern.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.190 align:middle line:84%
This pattern, also known as
the flower of life pattern,

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
is common in ancient
artwork depicting

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.080 align:middle line:90%
enlightened or awakened beings.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
When the pine cone image
is seen in sacred artwork,

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
it represents the
awakened third eye--

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
single-pointed consciousness,
directing the flow

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
of evolutionary energy.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
The pine cone
represents the flowering

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
of the higher chakras, which
are activated as sushumna rises

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.435 align:middle line:90%
to the Ajna Chakra and beyond.

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:84%
In Greek mythology, the
worshippers of Dionysus

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:84%
carried a thyrsus,
or giant staff,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
wrapped with spiraling vines
topped with a pine cone,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
again, representing
Dionysian energy,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
or Kundalini Shakti
as it travels up

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.675 align:middle line:84%
the spine to the pineal
body at the sixth chakra.

00:12:24.675 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:10%
In the heart of the Vatican, you
might expect a giant sculpture

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:10%
of Jesus or Mary, but instead,
we find a giant pine cone

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:10%
statue, indicating that
in Christian history,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:10%
there may have been knowledge
of the chakras and Kundalini.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But for whatever reason, it
was kept from the masses.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
The official Church
explanation is

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that the pine cone is a
symbol of regeneration

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and represents new
life in Christ.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The 13th century philosopher
and mystic, Meister Eckhart,

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
said, "The eye with
which I see God

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and the eye with which God
sees me is one in the same."

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In the King James Bible, Jesus
said, "The light of the body

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
is the eye.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
If therefore thine
eye be single,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
thy whole body shall
be full of light."

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha said,
"The body is an eye."

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
In the state of samadhi, one
is both the seer and the seen.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We are the universe,
aware of itself.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
When Kundalini is activated,
it stimulates the sixth chakra

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and pineal center,
and this area starts

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
to regain some of its
evolutionary functions.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Darkness meditation
has been used

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years as a way
to activate the sixth chakra

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:90%
in the area of the pineal gland.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Activation of this
center allows a person

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see
their inner light,

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
whether it is the proverbial
yogi or shaman retreating deep

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle line:84%
into a cave, or Taoist or Mayan
initiate, or a Tibetan monk,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.650 align:middle line:84%
all traditions incorporate a
period of time during which one

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:90%
goes into the darkness.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is the gateway
to being able to experience

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:90%
one's subtle energy directly.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher Nietzsche said,
"If you stare into the abyss

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
long enough, eventually, you
find the abyss stares back

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:90%
at you."

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Dolmens, or ancient
portal tombs,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
are among the oldest
remaining structures on Earth.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.625 align:middle line:84%
Most date to date to
the Neolithic period

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:84%
of 3,000 to 4,000 BC, and
some in Western Europe

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:90%
are 7,000 years old.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The dolmen was used to enter
into perpetual meditation,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.030 align:middle line:84%
as a way for a human to bridge
the inner and outer worlds.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
As one continues to
meditate in total darkness,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.060 align:middle line:84%
eventually, one begins to
observe inner energy, or light,

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:90%
as the third eye becomes active.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:84%
The circadian rhythms, which
are governed by the sun and moon

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
channels, no longer control
the functions of the body,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and a new rhythm is established.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
The seventh chakra,
for thousands of years,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:84%
has been represented by
the "Om" symbol, a symbol,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
which is constructed by
Sanskrit signs representing

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:90%
the elements.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:84%
When Kundalini rises
beyond the sixth chakra,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
it begins to create
an energy halo.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:10%
Halos appear consistently
in the religious paintings

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.810 align:middle line:10%
of different traditions in all
different parts of the world.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:10%
The halo, or the depiction
of an energy signature

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:10%
around an awakened being,
is common to virtually

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:10%
all religions in all
parts of the world.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:10%


00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:10%
The evolutionary process
of awakening the chakras

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:10%
is not the property of
one group or one religion.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.805 align:middle line:10%
It is the birthright of every
human being on the planet.

00:17:52.805 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:10%
The crown chakra
is the connection

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:10%
to the divine, that which is
beyond duality, beyond name

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:10%
and form.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten was a pharaoh
whose wife was Nefertiti.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
He is referred to as
"The Son of the Sun."

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.140 align:middle line:84%
He rediscovered Aten,
or the Word of God,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
within himself, uniting
Kundalini and consciousness.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian
iconography, once again,

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:84%
the awakened consciousness
is represented

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.195 align:middle line:84%
by the solar disk seen above
the heads of gods or awakened

00:18:55.195 --> 00:18:55.995 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:18:55.995 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
In the Hindu and
Yogic traditions,

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:90%
this halo was called Sahasrara--

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:17.510 align:middle line:90%
the 1,000-pedal lotus.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha is associated
with the symbol of the lotus.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The phyllotaxis pattern
is the same pattern

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
as can be found in
a blooming lotus.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It is the flower of life
pattern, the seed of life.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the fundamental pattern
into which all forms fit.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It is the very shape
of space itself,

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:90%
or a quality inherent to Akasha.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.470 align:middle line:84%
At one time in history,
the flower of life symbol

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:90%
was prevalent all over Earth.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
The flower of life
is found guarded

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
by lions at the entrance of
the most holy places in China

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.635 align:middle line:90%
and other parts of Asia.

00:20:09.635 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The 64 hexagrams of
the I Ching often

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
surround a yin
yang symbol, which

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
is yet another way
of representing

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.385 align:middle line:90%
the flower of life.

00:20:24.385 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Within the flower of life
is the geometric basis

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
for all of the platonic
solids, essentially every form

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:90%
that can exist.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The ancient flower
of life begins

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:84%
with the geometry of
the Star of David,

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
or upward and
downward-facing triangles.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Or in 3D, these would be
tetrahedral structures.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:90%
This symbol is a yantra--

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
a sort of program that
exists within the universe,

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.695 align:middle line:84%
the machine that is
generating our fractal world.

00:20:57.695 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Yantras have been used as tools
for awakening consciousness

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.640 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The visual form of the yantra
is an external representation

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.270 align:middle line:84%
of an inner process of
spiritual unfolding.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It is the hidden music of
the universe made visible,

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:84%
comprised of intersecting
geometrical forms

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:90%
and interference patterns.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:39.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra is a
lotus, a yantra,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:84%
a psychophysiological
center through which

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:90%
the world can be experienced.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
A traditional yantra, such as
can be found in the Tibetan

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
tradition, is invested with
rich layers of meaning,

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
sometimes incorporating a
complete cosmology and world

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.720 align:middle line:90%
view.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The yantra is a constantly
evolving pattern

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:84%
which works through the
power of repetition,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:90%
or iteration of a cycle.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.660 align:middle line:84%
The power of the yantra is
all but lost in today's world

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.230 align:middle line:84%
because we seek meaning
only in the external form

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and we do not connect
it to our inner energies

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:90%
through intention.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:59.060 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a good reason why
priests, monks, and yogis

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:84%
traditionally have
been celibate.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Today, all but a
tiny few know why

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:84%
they are practicing celibacy
because the true purpose has

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:90%
become lost.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Quite simply, if
your energy is going

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:84%
into producing more sperm
or eggs, as the case may be,

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:84%
then there is not
as much to fuel

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
the rising of Kundalini, which
activates the higher chakras.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is life energy,
which is also sexual energy.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:10%
When awareness becomes
less focused on animal

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:10%
urges and is put
into the objects

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:10%
reflective of the
higher chakras,

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.855 align:middle line:10%
that energy flows up the
spine and to those chakras.

00:23:44.855 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of the tantric
practices teach

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:84%
how to master sexual energy
so that it can be used

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.500 align:middle line:90%
for higher spiritual evolution.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Your state of consciousness
creates the right conditions

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
for your energy to
be able to grow.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Entering a state of
consciousness takes no time.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.280 align:middle line:84%
As Eckhart Tolle says,
"Awareness and presence

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:90%
always happen in the now.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
If you are trying to
make something happen,

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.070 align:middle line:84%
then you are creating
resistance to what is.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
It is the removing of all
resistance that allows

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:90%
evolutionary energy to unfold."

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Yogic
tradition, yoga postures

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
were used to prepare
the body for meditation.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Hatha yoga was never intended
solely as an exercise regime

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:84%
but as a way to link one's
inner and outer worlds.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:84%
The Sanskrit word "hatha" means
"sun," "ha," and "moon," "tha."

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.150 align:middle line:84%
In the original Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali,

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of the
Eight Limbs of yoga

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.700 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the
Buddha's Eightfold Path--

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.580 align:middle line:90%
to liberate one from suffering.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
When the polarities of the
dual world are in balance,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:90%
a third thing is born.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We find the
mysterious golden key

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:28.030 align:middle line:84%
that unlocks the evolutionary
forces of nature.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
This synthesis of the
sun and moon channels

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.455 align:middle line:90%
is our evolutionary energy.

00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:43.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Because humans are now
identified almost exclusively

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts
and the outer world,

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
it is a rare individual
that achieves

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:84%
a balance of the
inner and outer forces

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:84%
which allow Kundalini
to awaken naturally.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.490 align:middle line:84%
For those identified
only with the illusion,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini will always
remain a metaphor, an idea,

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than a direct
experience of one's energy

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:29.611 align:middle line:90%
