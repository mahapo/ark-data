with the world's

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%

have taught for

went off in my head.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Circles.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I turned to my
colleagues and said,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
we didn't talk about circles,
and circles are the key

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:90%
to Joe's understanding of God.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I picked up the phone and called
him in Hawaii, and I said,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:90%
we must have one more session.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:90%
We haven't talked about circles.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
He chuckled and
agreed, you're on.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So we met in New York at
the museum on Central Park.

We didn't know this would
be our last time together.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:10%
But looking back,
I am tempted to see

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:10%
in his face and his bearing the
premonition that his life was

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:10%
nearing its end.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
What I do remember most
vividly from that evening

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
is that I had never seen
so much life in his eyes.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Is there something in
common in every culture that

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:90%
creates this need for God?

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think anyone who has
an experience of mystery at all

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
knows that there is a
dimension, let's say,

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that is not
that which is available to his

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:90%
senses.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful saying
in one of the Upanishads,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
when before a sunset or a
mountain and the beauty of this

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
or of that, you
pause and say, ah,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
that is participation
in divinity.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's what it is.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the realization
of wonder, and also

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
the experience of
tremendous power,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
which people of course,
living in the world of nature

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:90%
are experiencing all the time.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
You know there's
something there that much

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.790 align:middle line:84%
bigger than the human
dimension and our way

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:84%
of thinking in
the West, largely,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
is that god is the
source of the energy.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:10%
The way in most
oriental thinking,

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:10%
and I think in most what we
call primitive thinking also,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:10%
is that god is a manifestation
of the energy, not its source,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:10%
that God is the
vehicle of the energy.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And the level of energy that
is involved are represented

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
determines the
character of the god.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
There are gods of violence,
there are gods of compassion,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
there are gods
that unite the two.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%

in their war campaigns.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:84%
These are personifications
of the energy that's in play.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And what the source
of the energy is--

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
what's the source of the energy
of these lights around us?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a total mystery.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Doesn't this make
a faith in anarchy,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
a sort of continuing war
among principalities?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>> As life is, yes.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in your mind,
when it comes to do anything,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
there will be a war, a
decision as to priorities.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.760 align:middle line:90%
What should you do now?

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Or in relationship
to other people,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:84%
there would be four
or five possibilities

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:84%
from my way of action, and the
notion of divinity or divine

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
life, then my mind would be what
would determine my decision.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.550 align:middle line:84%
If it were rather
crude, it would

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:90%
be a rather crude decision.

>> Is divinity
just what we think?

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that do to faith?

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
tough one about faith.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You are a man of faith.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
You're a man of wonder and--

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I don't
have to have faith.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:90%
I have experience.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of experience?

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have experience
with the wonder of the life.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I have experience of
love, I have experience

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of hatred and malice.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to punch the guy's
jaw, and I admit this.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.530 align:middle line:84%
But those are
different divinities,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from the point of
view of a symbolic imaging.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Those are different than
images operating in me.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when
I was a little boy

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
was being brought
up a Roman Catholic,

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I was told I had a guardian
angel on my right side

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and a tempting devil on my left.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And when it came to making a
decision of what I would do,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.510 align:middle line:84%
the decision would
depend on which

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:90%
one had most influence on me.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And I must say
that in my boyhood,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:10%
and I think also in the
people who were teaching me,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:10%
they actually concretized
those thoughts.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
>> They did what?

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It was an angel.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:84%
That angel is a fact
and the devil is a fact.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, one thinks of them as
metaphors for the energies that

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:90%
are afflicting and guiding you.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And those energies come from?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:10%
>> From your own life, the
energy of your own body.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Your different
organs in your body,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
including your head
the conflict systems.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And your life
comes from where?

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> There you are.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
From the ultimate energy that's
the life of the universe.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you say, well,
somebody has to generate that.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Why do you have to say that?

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
Why can't it be impersonal?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.260 align:middle line:90%
That would be brahman.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
transcendent mystery

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
that you can also personify.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Can men and women live
with and impersonality?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:90%
They do all over the place.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.901 align:middle line:90%
Just go east of Suez.

00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:41.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
In the East, the gods
are much more elemental.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Elemental?

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Elemental, less human, and
more like the powers of nature.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I see a deity as representing
an energy system.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And part of the energy system
is the human energy systems

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:84%
of love and malice, hate,
benevolence, compassion.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And in oriental
thinking, the God

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:18.285 align:middle line:84%
is the vehicle and the
energy, not its source.

00:11:18.285 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, the heart
of the Christian faith is that

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
these elemental forces
you're talking about embodied

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
themselves in a human being
and reconciling mankind to god.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and the basic Buddhist
idea is that that is true

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of you as well, and that what
Jesus was a person who realized

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that in himself and lived out
of the Christhood of his nature.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
think about Jesus?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We just don't know Jesus.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
All we know are four
contradictory texts

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:90%
that tell us what he did.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Written many
years after he lived.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think we
know what Jesus said.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I think the sayings of Jesus
are probably pretty close.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you read the
Thomas gospel, the Gospel

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:84%
according to Thomas, which
was dug up there in that--

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
with those other Gnostic texts,
it has all the flavor of one

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:90%
of the synoptics--

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:90%
Matthew, Mark, or Luke--

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
except that it doesn't
say quite the same thing.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:90%
There's one wonderful passage.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the last one in
the gospel, actually.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:90%
When will the kingdom come?

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Mark 13,
I think it is, we

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
hear that the end of the
world is going to come.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:10%
That's to say, a
mythological image--

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:10%
that's the end of
the world-- is taken

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:10%
as a reference to an actual,
physical, historical fact

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.520 align:middle line:10%
to be.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
When you read the Thomas
gospel, Jesus says,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
the kingdom of the father
will not come by expectation.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of the father
is spread upon the Earth

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:90%
and then do we not see it.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So I look at you
now in that sense,

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and the radiance of the
presence of the divine

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:90%
is known to me through you.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Through me?

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You, sure.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> A journalist?

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus also says in this text,
he who drinks from my mouth

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
will become as I am,
and I shall be he.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
He's talking from
the point of view

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:84%
of that being of beings,
which we call a Christ, who

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:90%
is the being of all of us.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who lives in
relation to that is as Christ,

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and anyone who incarnates, or
rather, brings into his life

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the message of the word
is equivalent to Jesus.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the sense there.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what you
mean when you say,

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:90%
I am radiating God to you.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You are, yes.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And you to me.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.408 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm speaking
this seriously.

00:14:05.408 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, I take it seriously.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I happen to believe
the same as you

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.410 align:middle line:84%
without being able to
articulate it as you do.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I do sense that
there is divinity,

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:90%
that divinity is in the other.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So you are the vehicle.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:84%
You are, as it were,
radiant of the Spirit.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- why
not recognize it?

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you what the
most gripping scripture

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
in the Christian New
Testament is for me.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It says, I believe
help thou my unbelief.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe in what?

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe in this
ultimate reality,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and that I can experience
it, that I do experience it.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have
answers to my questions.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I believe in the question.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a very amusing
experience which might be well

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:90%
worth telling.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I was in the New York
Athletic Club swimming pool.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you don't
wear your collar this way

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
or that way when you're
in a swimming pool.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was introduced
to a priest--

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.210 align:middle line:84%
this is father so-and-so,
this is Joseph Campbell.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a professor.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:84%
He's a professor at one of
our Catholic universities.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So after I'd had my swim, I
came and sat down beside--

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
in what we call the
horizontal athlete situation,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:90%
and the priest is beside me.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Mr Campbell,
are you a priest?

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, Father.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:90%
He said, are you a Catholic?

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:10%
I said, I was, Father.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
He said-- and now he had the
sense to ask it this way,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
do you believe in
a personal god?

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, Father.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well,
I suppose there

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:10%
is no way to prove by logic the
existence of a personal god.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if there
were, Father, what

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:90%
would be the value of faith?

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr Campbell, it's nice to
have met you, and he was off.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I really felt I'd
done a jujitsu trick.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But that was a very
illuminating conversation to me.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
The fact that he
asked, do you believe

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:84%
in a personal god,
that meant that he also

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
recognized the possibility
of the Brahman,

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:90%
of the transcendent energy.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, then, what is religion?

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the word religion
means "religio," linking back,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
linking back the phenomenal
person to a source.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
If we say it is the
one life in both of us,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
then my separate life has
been linked to the one

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:90%
life, religio, linked back.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And then?

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And this becomes symbolized
in the images of religion,

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.760 align:middle line:84%
which represent that
connecting link.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Your friend Jung,
the great psychologist,

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
says that the most powerful
religious symbol is the circle.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.680 align:middle line:84%
He says, the circle is one of
the great primordial images

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
of mankind, that in considering
the symbol of the circle

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle line:90%
we are analyzing the self.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:10%
And I find you, in your own
work throughout the course

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:10%
of your life, coming
across the circle,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:10%
whether it's in the magical
designs the world over,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:10%
whether it's in
the architecture,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:10%
both ancient and
modern, whether it's

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:10%
in the dome-shaped
temples of India

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.360 align:middle line:10%
or the calendar
stone to the Aztecs

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.700 align:middle line:10%
or the ancient
Chinese bronze shields

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.880 align:middle line:10%
or the visions of the Old
Testament prophet Ezekiel,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:10%
whom you talk about,
the wheel in the sky.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.890 align:middle line:10%
You keep coming
across this image.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's ever present.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the center from
which you've come,

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:90%
back to which you'll go.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading in a book
about the American Indians,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.715 align:middle line:84%
called "The Indian
Book" by Natalie Curtis

00:18:16.715 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that was published around 1904,
her conversation with a chief.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the chief
of the Pawnee tribe.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And among other things he
said was, when we pitch camp,

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:90%
we pitch a camp in a circle.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the horizon,
the horizon is in a circle.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:49.640 align:middle line:84%
When the eagle builds a nest,
the nest is in a circle.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you read
in Plato somewhere,

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:90%
the soul is a circle.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
I suppose the circle
represents a totality.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Within the circle is one thing.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:90%
It is encircled, it's enframed.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
That would be the
spatial aspect.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But the temporal
aspect of the circle

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:84%
is you leave, go somewhere, and
come back, the alpha and omega.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
God is the alpha and omega,
the source and the end.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Somehow the circle suggests
immediately completed totality,

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:90%
whether in time or in space.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> No beginning, no end.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, round and
round and round.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The year, well, this
is November again,

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and we're about to
have Thanksgiving again

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're about to
have Christmas again.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And then not only the year,
but the month, the moon cycle,

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
and the day, the cycle.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're reminded of this
when we look on our watch

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:90%
and see the cycle of time.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the same hour,
the same hour,

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
but another day, and
all that sort of thing.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you suppose the circle
became so universally symbolic?

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because it's
experienced all the time.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.800 align:middle line:84%
You experience it in the day
and year, just as we've said,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and you experience it
in leaving home, going

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
on your adventure, hunting
or whatever it may be,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:90%
and coming back to home.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a deeper one also,

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
the mystery of the
womb and the tomb.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
When people are buried,
it's for rebirth.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the origin
of the burial idea.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
You put back into the womb
of Mother Earth or rebirth.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And Jung kept returning
to that theme of the circle

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
as being the sort
of universal symbol.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jung used that as a
pedagogical device, actually,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:90%
what he called the mandala.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
This was actually a Hindu
term for a sacred circle.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Here is one of the pictures.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a very
elaborate mandala.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You have the deity at
the center with the power

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:84%
source, the illumination
source, and these

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.860 align:middle line:84%
are the manifestations or
aspects of its radiance.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But in working out a mandala
for oneself, what one does

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is draw a circle and then
think of the different impulse

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
systems in your life,
the different value

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
systems in your
life, and try then

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:84%
to compose them and
find what the center.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
discipline for pulling

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:84%
all those scattered
aspects of your life

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
together and finding a center
and ordering yourself to it.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're trying to
coordinate your circle

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:90%
with the universal circle.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> To be at the center.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>> At the center.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.920 align:middle line:84%
The Navajo have
that wonderful image

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
of what they call
the pollen path.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize what
pollen is, it's the life source.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a single
path of the center.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they would say, beauty
for me, beauty behind me,

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
beauty to the right of me,
beauty to the left of me,

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.511 align:middle line:84%
beauty above me, beauty below
me, I'm on the pollen path.

00:22:25.511 --> 00:22:29.327 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:32.864 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.864 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the little
cosmos of one's own life

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and the macrocosm
of the world's life

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.386 align:middle line:84%
are in some way
to be coordinated.

00:22:44.386 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, for instance,
among the Navajo Indians,

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
healing ceremonies
were conducted

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:84%
by way of sand
paintings, which are

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.920 align:middle line:90%
mostly mandalas on the ground.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the person who is to be
treated moves into the mandala.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
There will be a
mythological context

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that they will be
identifying with,

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and he identifies
himself with that power.

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of sand
painting with mandalas

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and used for meditation
purposes appears also in Tibet,

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
in the great tantric monasteries
outside of Lhasa, for instance,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Gyuto, they practiced sand
painting, cosmic images and so

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.280 align:middle line:84%
forth, indicating the forces
of the spiritual powers that

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.445 align:middle line:90%
operate in our lives.

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what do
you make of that,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that in two very
different cultures,

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:90%
the same imagery emerges?

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are only
two ways to explain it,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and one is by diffusion, that
an influence came from there

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:90%
to here.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other is by
separate development.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:10%
And when you have the idea
of separate development,

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:10%
this speaks for certain
powers in the psyche which

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:10%
are common to all mankind.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you couldn't have--

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and to the detail
the correspondences

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
can be identified,
it's astonishing

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:24.580 align:middle line:84%
when one studies
these things in depth

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
the degree to which the
agreements go between totally

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:90%
separated cultures.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Which says something about
the commonality of the species,

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yes, that
was Carl Jung's idea,

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
which he calls the archetypes,
archetypes of the collective

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:90%
unconscious.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.667 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
mean by archetypes?

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> An archetype is a
constant form, a basic,

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:57.250 align:middle line:84%
fundamental form which appears
in the works of that person

00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
over there and this person over
here, without connecting them.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They are expressions of the
structure of the human psyche.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you find in a variety
of cultures each one telling

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.710 align:middle line:84%
the story of creation, the
story of a virgin birth,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:21.760 align:middle line:84%
the story of a savior who comes
and dies and is resurrected,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
you're saying something about
what is inside us and the need

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
One can say that
the images of myth

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
are reflections of spiritual
and depth potentialities

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.160 align:middle line:90%
of every one of us.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And that through
contemplating those,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:84%
we evoke those powers
in our own lives

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.370 align:middle line:90%
to operate through ourselves.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.790 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
important anthropologist--

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.790 align:middle line:84%
he's the one with whom my
works begin, you might say,

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:90%
my studies--

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Bastian in Germany,
end of the last century

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:90%
in first part of this.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.610 align:middle line:84%
He was a world
traveler and recognized

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
very soon that there were
certain motifs that appeared

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
in all of the religions
and all of the mythologies

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.450 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Such an idea, for example,
as a spiritual power,

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:84%
that's an archetypal image
that appears everywhere.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And he called these
elementary ideas.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
But they appear in
very different forms

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and different provinces
and at different times.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And those different
forms or costumes

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:90%
he called ethnic or folk ideas.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But within the ethnic idea
is the elementary idea.

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And it is those elementary
ideas that Carl Jung

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:84%
then began studying and called
archetypes of the unconscious.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:84%
When you say elementary idea,
they seem to come from up here.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.260 align:middle line:84%
When you say archetypes
of the unconscious,

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
they come from up here, and
they appear in our dreams

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.200 align:middle line:90%
as well as in the myths.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So when one scripture talks
about being made in his image,

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in God's image, it's being
created with certain qualities

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that every human
being possesses,

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
no matter what that
person's religion or culture

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.680 align:middle line:90%
or geography or heritage.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>> God would be the ultimate
elementary idea of man.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> The primal need.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And we are all made
in the image of God, OK?

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So that is the ultimate
elementary idea

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:90%
or archetype of man.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel stronger in my own
faith knowing that others had

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the same yearnings and were
seeking for the same images

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
to try to express an experience
that couldn't be costumed

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:90%
in an ordinary human language.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel much more kinship with
all those who follow other ways

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.190 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> This is why clowns are good--

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Clowns?

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>> --in religions, because
they show that the image is not

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
a fact, but it's a
reflex of some kind.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So does this help explain
the trickster gods that show up

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:90%
from time to time?

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very much that, yes.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of the best
trickster stories

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
are associated with our
American Indian tales.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, these figures are
clown-like figures,

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and yet they are the creator
gods at the same time,

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:90%
very often.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And this makes the point, I
am not the ultimate image.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I am transparent to something.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Through me, through
my funny form,

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and mocking it and turning
it into a grotesque action,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
you really get the
sense which, if I

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.670 align:middle line:84%
had been a big, sober presence,
you get stuck with the image.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a wonderful story
in some African tradition

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
of the god who's
walking down the road,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and the god has on a hat that
is colored red on one side

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and blue on the other side.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So when the people the
farmers in the field

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
go in to the village in
the evening, they say,

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.960 align:middle line:84%
did you see that fellow,
that god with the blue hat?

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And the others say, no,
no, he had a red hat on.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And they get into a fight.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> He even makes it worse
by first walking along this

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.430 align:middle line:84%
direction, then turning
around, turning his head around

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:26.300 align:middle line:84%
so that, again, it'll be
red and black or whatever.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And then when these two
chaps fight and are brought

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
before the king or
chief for judgment,

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:84%
this fellow appears, and he
says, it's my fault. I did it.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Spreading strife
is my greatest joy.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's a truth in that.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.425 align:middle line:90%
>> There sure is.

00:29:44.425 --> 00:29:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is?

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter what system
of thought you have,

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.040 align:middle line:84%
it can't possibly
include boundless life.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you think
everything's just that way,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
the trickster comes
in, it all blows,

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and you get the big
coming thing again.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jung has a wonderful
saying somewhere.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:06.747 align:middle line:84%
Religion is a defense against
a religious experience.

00:30:06.747 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you have to explain that.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that means it has
reduced the whole thing

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to concepts and ideas, and
having the concept and idea

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
short circuits the
transcendent experience.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:10%
The experience of
deep mystery is

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:10%
what one has to regard as the
ultimate religious experience.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But there are many Christians
who believe that to try to find

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:84%
out who Jesus is, you have to
go past the Christian faith,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.765 align:middle line:84%
past the Christian doctrine,
past the Christian church.

00:30:37.765 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's heresy
for a lot of people.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have to go
past the image of Jesus.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The image of god becomes
the final obstruction.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Your God is your
ultimate barrier.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:84%
This is basic Hinduism,
basic Buddhism,

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.930 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the ascent of the
spirit through the centers,

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the chakras, as they're
called, or lotuses,

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
the different centers
of experience,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
the animal experiences
of hunger and greed,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.860 align:middle line:84%
or just the zeal
of reproduction,

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.920 align:middle line:84%
or physical mastery of
one kind or another.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.830 align:middle line:90%
These are all stages of power.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But then when the
center of the heart

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
is reached and the
sense of compassion

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
on another person,
mercy and participation,

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and I and you are in some
sense of the same being--

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.940 align:middle line:84%
this is what marriage
is based on--

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.720 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole new stage
of life experience opens up

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.830 align:middle line:90%
with the opening of the heart.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's called
the virgin birth, actually,

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
the birth of a spiritual life
in what formerly was simply

00:31:54.460 --> 00:32:01.030 align:middle line:84%
a human animal living for the
animal aims of health, progeny,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.060 align:middle line:90%
wealth, and a little fun.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But now you come
to something else

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
this sense of accord

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.500 align:middle line:84%
with another or accord
with some principle that

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
has lodged in your mind as a
good to be identified with.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Then a whole new life comes.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in
oriental thinking,

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
the awakening of the
religious experience.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And then this can go on even
to the quest for the experience

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:90%
of the ultimate mystery.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ultimate mystery
can be experienced

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:43.900 align:middle line:84%
in two senses, one without
form and the other with form.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And in this oriental
thinking, you

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.420 align:middle line:90%
experience god with form here.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:90%
This is heaven.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the identification
with your own being

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.750 align:middle line:84%
because that which
god refers to is

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate mystery
of being, which

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is the mystery of your being
as well as of the world.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:90%
So this is it.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you explain what the
psychologist Maslow calls peak

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.828 align:middle line:84%
experiences and what your friend
James Joyce called epiphanies?

00:33:14.828 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I love that word, "epiphanies."

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, they're
not quite the same.

00:33:17.787 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The peak experience refers
to actual moments of your life

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.930 align:middle line:84%
when you feel that this
has told you something.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Something has come
through in your experience

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:84%
of your relationship,
through the harmony of being.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It can come-- my
peak experiences,

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ones that I
knew were peak experiences

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:84%
after I had them, all
came in athletics.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Which was the Everest
of your experience.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Which one was it, was when
you were running at Columbia?

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And I ran a couple of races
that was just beautiful.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And through the whole race,
I knew I was going to win,

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
reason for me no

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I was going to win
because I was touched

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
off anchoring a relay with the
first man 30 yards ahead of me.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.739 align:middle line:84%
And I just knew, knew it
was a peak experience.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:19.449 align:middle line:90%
Nobody could beat me today.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:26.860 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of being in full
form and really doing it.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever
done anything in my life

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:32.409 align:middle line:84%
as competently as I
ran those two races.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And those, consequently,
were the experience

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
of really being at my full
and doing perfect job.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've
ever had anything

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:84%
like that quite,
that I really came up

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:90%
to anything quite that way.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think you,
Joseph Campbell,

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:90%
have to-- it has to be physical?

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:90%
>> No, but it can be a peak--

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:84%
there are other kinds
of experiences which

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I know were superior to those.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But those are the ones that,
when I read Maslow and read

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
the peak experience,
I just know that those

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.320 align:middle line:90%
were peak experiences.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.230 align:middle line:84%
>> What about James
Joyce's epiphanies?

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, that's another thing.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the
aesthetic experience.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Joyce's formula for the
aesthetic experience

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:27.730 align:middle line:84%
is that it does not move you
to want to possess the object.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:90%
That he calls pornography.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Nor does it move you
to criticize and reject

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:90%
the object.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.570 align:middle line:84%
That he calls didactic,
social criticism and art

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of thing.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It is the holding the object.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you put
a frame around it

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:90%
and see it as one thing.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And then seeing it
as one thing, you

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.510 align:middle line:84%
become aware of the relationship
of pot to pot, and pot to coal,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:90%
and coal to heat the pot.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the essential aesthetic
factor, rhythm, the rhythm,

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.350 align:middle line:90%
rhythmic relationships.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And when a fortunate rhythm
has been struck by the artist,

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:90%
that is the radiance.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the epiphany.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:16.393 align:middle line:84%
And that is what would be
the Christ coming through.

00:36:16.393 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The face of the
saint beholding god.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't
matter who it is.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could take
someone who you would

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.770 align:middle line:90%
think of as being a monster.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:84%
That is an ethical
judgment on the life,

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.343 align:middle line:84%
and this is transcendent
of ethics, no didactic.

00:36:37.343 --> 00:36:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where I would disagree
with you because it seems

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
to me, in order to
experience the epiphany,

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that which you behold but do
not want to possess must be

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.190 align:middle line:90%
beautiful in some way.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And a moment ago,
when you talked

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.730 align:middle line:84%
about your peak
experience, running,

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:90%
you said it was beautiful.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.883 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful is an aesthetic word.

00:36:54.883 --> 00:36:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And how can you
behold a monster?

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I tell you, there's another
emotion associated with art

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:84%
which is not of the
beautiful, but of the sublime.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And what we call monsters
can be seen as sublime.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And they represent powers
too great for the mere forms

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.700 align:middle line:90%
of life to survive.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:10%
Prodigious expanse
of space is sublime.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the thing that
the Buddhists know how

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:90%
to achieve in their temples.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, when
I was in Kyoto--

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I was there for seven
glorious months.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> In Japan.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, visiting some
of the temple gardens.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.510 align:middle line:84%
They are so designed that you're
experiencing something here.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you break
past the screen

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.620 align:middle line:84%
and a whole new
horizon opens out.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, with the
diminishment of your own ego,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.100 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness expands.

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the experience
of the sublime.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Another experience
of this sublime

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:84%
is not of tremendous space, but
of tremendous energy and power.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And I have known
a couple of people

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:14.170 align:middle line:84%
who were in central Europe
during the saturation

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:17.470 align:middle line:84%
bombings that were
conducted over those cities.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.585 align:middle line:90%
And there was the--

00:38:19.585 --> 00:38:23.590 align:middle line:84%
you just have the experience
of the sublime there.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I once interviewed a veteran
of the Second World War,

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking to him about
his experience at the Battle

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:34.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Bulge with the assault
of the Germans about to succeed.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, as you
look back on it, what was it?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.295 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it was sublime.

00:38:39.295 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.318 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the monster
comes through there.

00:38:45.318 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean by monster?

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, by a monster I
mean someone who breaks all

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of your standards for harmony
and for ethical conduct.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a story in mythology
that illustrates the sublime

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.210 align:middle line:90%
in the monster?

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the god of
the end of the world.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu, at the end of
the world, is a monster.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's destroying the
world, first with fire and then

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:84%
with a torrential
flood that drowns out

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:84%
the fire and everything else,
and nothing is left but ash.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.860 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe
has been wiped out.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.020 align:middle line:90%
That's god.

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Christian
millennialists talk

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:90%
of the rapture.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, read
chapter 13 in Mark.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Which says?

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the end of the world.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
You see, these are experiences
that go past ethical judgment.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Ethics is wiped out.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Our religions, with the
accent on the human,

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.470 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned a little while
ago, also stress the ethical.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:90%
God is good.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:84%
God is horrific at
the end of the world.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
There's an Arab saying
that I read somewhere

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
in the "Arabian Nights"
of the angel of death.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.800 align:middle line:84%
When the angel of death
comes, it is terrible.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
When he has reached
you, it is bliss.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the Buddhist
systems, particularly

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:84%
as we get them from Tibet, the
Buddhas appear in two aspects.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There's the peaceful aspect,
and there is the wrathful aspect

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.360 align:middle line:90%
of the deity.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're clinging to
your ego and its little world

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and hanging on, and the
deity wants to open you,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:90%
the wrathful aspect comes.

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:90%
It seems to you terrible.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you are open
and open enough,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
then that same deity would
be experienced as bliss.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jesus talked
of bringing a sword,

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and I don't believe he meant
that in terms of using it

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:84%
against your fellow, but he
meant it in terms of opening

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.990 align:middle line:90%
the ego.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I came to cut you free from the
binding ego of your own self.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's known in Sanskrit
as viveka, discrimination.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
Buddha figure called

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Manjushri who will be shown with
a flaming sword over his head.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And what is the sword for?

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:16.690 align:middle line:84%
It's to distinguish the merely
temporal from the eternal.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.910 align:middle line:10%
It's the sword
that distinguishes

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:10%
that which is enduring from
that which is merely passing.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The tick, tick, tick of
time shuts out eternity,

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and we live in
the field of time.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
But what is living
in the field of time

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is an eternal principle
that's inflected this way.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the eternal principle?

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> But one.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is?

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we call it god, but
that personifies it, you see.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the experience
of the eternity.

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience
of the eternal.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> As what you are, I would say.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That whatever eternity
is, is here right now.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And nowhere else,
or everywhere else.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.930 align:middle line:84%
If you don't experience
it now, you're

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
never going to get
it because when

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:84%
you get to heaven,
that's not eternal,

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:90%
that's just everlasting.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Heaven lasts a long time.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.785 align:middle line:84%
It's not eternal,
it's everlasting.

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't follow that now.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> The eternal is beyond time.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The concept of time
shuts out eternity.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Time is our invention.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Our experience, yeah.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate
unqualified mystery

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:90%
is beyond human experience.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It becomes inflected.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:84%
As they say, there
is a condescension

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the infinite
to the mind of man,

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:90%
and that is what looks like god.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So whatever it
is we experience,

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:55.490 align:middle line:84%
we have to express and
language that is just not up

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:90%
to the occasion.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what poetry is for.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Poetry is a language that
has to be penetrated.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't shut you off.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:90%
It opens.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the rhythm.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.790 align:middle line:84%
The precise choice
of words that will

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:84%
have implications
and suggestions that

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:18.860 align:middle line:84%
go past the word is
what has to happen.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
what Joyce calls

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:90%
the radiance, the epiphany.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The epiphany is
the showing through

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:31.000 align:middle line:84%
of the essence,
what Aquinas called

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.560 align:middle line:90%
quidditas, the what-ness.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:90%
The what-ness is the brahman.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you think it is there
is in so many people this deep

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:84%
yearning to live forever, to
secure my place in heaven?

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:10%
>> When you realize
what heaven is, I mean,

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.020 align:middle line:10%
in the works of such
person as Thomas Aquinas,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:57.130 align:middle line:10%
it is the beholding of
the beatific image of god,

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.340 align:middle line:10%
which is a timeless moment.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Time explodes.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, eternity is not
something everlasting.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can have it right here
now in your relationships.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:10%
I've lost a lot of friends
and my parents and all,

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:23.620 align:middle line:10%
and a realization that has
come to me very, very keenly

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:32.250 align:middle line:10%
is that I haven't lost
them, that that moment when

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.720 align:middle line:10%
I was with them had an
everlasting quality about it

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.650 align:middle line:10%
that is now still with me.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.040 align:middle line:84%
What it gave me
is still with me.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a kind of intimation
of immortality in that.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I mean?

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.770 align:middle line:10%
>> But in the sense that you
were talking about eternity

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.730 align:middle line:10%
beyond the body,
experienced now in the body,

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.290 align:middle line:10%
but being beyond time, has
anybody told a story that--

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there's the story
of the Buddha who encountered

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.120 align:middle line:10%
a woman who had
just lost her son.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.820 align:middle line:90%
And she was in great grief.

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha said, I
suggest you just asked around

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to meet somebody who has
not lost a treasured child

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.350 align:middle line:84%
or husband or
relative or friend.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And this business of
understanding the relationship

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of mortality to something
in you that is transcendent

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.180 align:middle line:90%
of mortality is the big job.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's the wonderful
work of Schopenhauer's.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.640 align:middle line:84%
He says, when you
reach a certain age--

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and he wrote this when
he was in his 60s or so--

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:56.665 align:middle line:84%
and look back over your life,
it seems to have had an order.

00:45:56.665 --> 00:46:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have been
composed by someone.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And those events, that
when they occurred

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:84%
seemed merely accidental and
occasional and just something

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.550 align:middle line:84%
that happened, turn out
to be the main elements

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.490 align:middle line:90%
in a consistent plot.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:18.660 align:middle line:10%
So he says, who
composed this plot?

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and
just as your dreams

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:84%
are composed by an
aspect of yourself,

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:84%
of which your
consciousness is unaware,

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:28.650 align:middle line:84%
so your whole life
has been composed

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:90%
by the will within you.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Then he says, just as those
people who you met by chance

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.960 align:middle line:84%
became effective agents in
the structuring of your life,

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.880 align:middle line:84%
so you have been an agent in
the structuring of other lives.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing gears
together like one big symphony,

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:52.380 align:middle line:84%
he says, everything
influencing and structuring

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.300 align:middle line:90%
everything else.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's
as though our lives

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.600 align:middle line:84%
were the dream of a single
dreamer in which all the dream

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.620 align:middle line:90%
characters are dreaming too.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And so everything links
to everything else,

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.860 align:middle line:90%
moved out of the will in nature.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful idea.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:16.390 align:middle line:84%
It's an idea that
occurs in India

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:19.440 align:middle line:84%
in the image of what's
called the net of Indra,

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:90%
or the net of gems.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a net of gems
where every gem reflects

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.920 align:middle line:90%
all the other ones.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And they also have the idea of
a spontaneous and simultaneous

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:90%
arising.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything arises in
relation to everything else,

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and so you can't blame
anybody for anything.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all working around--

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.580 align:middle line:90%
it's a marvelous idea.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It's as though there were
an intention behind it,

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.200 align:middle line:90%
and yet all this by chance.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.940 align:middle line:84%
None of us has lived the
life that he intended.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:48:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, we all have lived
a life that had a purpose.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe that?

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe
life has a purpose.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when you really
see what life is,

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:10%
it's a lot of protoplasm with an
urge to reproduce and continue

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:10%
in being.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Not true.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:16.770 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no, wait a minute.

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Just sheer life can't be said
to have a purpose because look

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:25.140 align:middle line:84%
at all the different purposes
it has all over the lot.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But each incarnation, you
might say, has a potentiality,

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and the function of life is
to live that potentiality.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do you do it?

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, when my students
would ask, should I do this?

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:39.990 align:middle line:90%
Should I do that?

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Dad says, I should do this.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And my answer is,
follow your bliss.

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.290 align:middle line:84%
There's something
inside you that

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:53.160 align:middle line:84%
knows you're in the center, that
knows you're on the beam, that

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.170 align:middle line:90%
knows you're off the beam.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you get off the
beam to earn money,

00:48:58.350 --> 00:48:59.940 align:middle line:90%
you've lost your life.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is not the destination
that counts, it's the journey.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.750 align:middle line:90%
There's a wonderful old man--

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:08.565 align:middle line:84%
I think he's still
alive in Germany--

00:49:08.565 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:90%


00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Karlfried Graf Durckheim.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And he says, when
you're on a journey

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and the end keeps getting
further and further away,

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.770 align:middle line:84%
then you realize that
the real end the journey.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:90%
That's not bad.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.160 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.900 align:middle line:84%
This moment now is
the heavenly moment.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I like the idea that
Eden was not, Eden will be.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:90%


00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Eden is.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:49.040 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.040 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of the father
spread upon the Earth,

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and men do not see it.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:53.185 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Eden is.

00:49:53.185 --> 00:49:55.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There's some image of
Shiva the God Shiva surrounded

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.170 align:middle line:84%
by circles of flame,
rings of fire.

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the
Dance of the World,

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the dancer whose
dance is the universe.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And in this hand,
he has a little drum

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:12.970 align:middle line:90%
that goes tick, tick, tick.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:17.110 align:middle line:84%
That is the drum of
time, the tick of time

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.210 align:middle line:90%
which shuts out eternity.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:21.580 align:middle line:90%
And we are enclosed in that.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.040 align:middle line:84%
In this had, there
is a flame which

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
burns away the veil of time
and opens us up to eternity.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And in his hair is a
skull and a new moon,

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.290 align:middle line:84%
the death and rebirth
at the same moment,

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:41.410 align:middle line:90%
the moment of becoming.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a powerful image
for any life, not just--

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the goal of your quest
for yourself is to find that

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.640 align:middle line:84%
burning point in yourself, that
becoming thing in yourself,

00:50:52.640 --> 00:51:01.950 align:middle line:84%
which is fearless and
desireless, but just becoming.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the condition of a
warrior going into battle

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:07.380 align:middle line:90%
with perfect courage.

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's life in
movement, a plant growing.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.050 align:middle line:90%
I think of grass.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Every two weeks, a chap
comes out with a lawn mower

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:17.370 align:middle line:90%
and cuts it down.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the grass were to
say, well, for Pete's sake.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:90%
What's the use?

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the coming into
being that's it.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the lifepoint in you.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what these myths are
concerned to communicate to.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've always
interpreted that powerful,

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:39.600 align:middle line:84%
mysterious statement,
the word was made flesh,

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.580 align:middle line:84%
as this eternal principle
finding itself in the human

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:90%
journey, the human experience.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what the word is,

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even
know what flesh is.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:55.080 align:middle line:84%
But I know that there is
that experience of epiphany

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.170 align:middle line:84%
when you meet what you don't
know and understand it.

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:00.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, and you can
find it in yourself, too,

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.920 align:middle line:10%
the word in yourself.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you find it if
you don't find it yourself?

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Goethe says,
all things are metaphors.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.050 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything that's transitory is
but a metaphorical reference.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:18.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what we all are.

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And to see the word--

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:24.390 align:middle line:84%
we're getting back
to that your radiance

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:28.750 align:middle line:84%
that we spoke of before
comes out here again now.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>> But how does one worship
a metaphor, love a metaphor,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.930 align:middle line:90%
die for a metaphor?

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what people
are doing all over the place.

00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:42.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what people are
doing all over the place,

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.010 align:middle line:90%
dying for metaphors.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you really
realize the sound aum,

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.960 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the
mystery of the word,

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.040 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, then you
don't have to go out

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:84%
die for anything because
it's right there all around.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And just sit still and see it
and experience it you know it.

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Explain aum.

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the first time
you've used that.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, aum is a word that--

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.860 align:middle line:10%
what can I say--

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:13.070 align:middle line:10%
represents to our
ears that sound

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:15.980 align:middle line:10%
of the energy of the universe,
of which all things are

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:18.980 align:middle line:10%
manifestations.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And aum is a wonderful word.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It's written A-U-M. you start
in the back of the mouth, ah.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, ooh, you
fill the mouth.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And mm closes at the mouth.

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
pronounced this properly,

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:45.020 align:middle line:84%
all vowel sounds are in
that pronunciation, aum.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And consonants are regarded
simply as interruptions of aum.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And all words are
thus fragments of aum,

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.280 align:middle line:84%
as all images are fragments
of the form of forms

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.390 align:middle line:84%
of which all things
are just reflections.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And so aum is a symbol,
a symbolic sound,

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:10.100 align:middle line:84%
that puts you in touch
with that throbbing being

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.340 align:middle line:90%
that is the universe.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.328 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:54:16.328 --> 00:54:25.685 align:middle line:90%


00:54:25.685 --> 00:54:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you hear some
of these Tibetan monks

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that are over here from
the Gyuto monastery

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.800 align:middle line:84%
outside of Lhasa, when
they sing the aums,

00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.480 align:middle line:84%
you know what it
means, all right.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the zoom of
being in the world.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And to be in touch with that and
to get the sense of that, that

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:57.190 align:middle line:90%
is the peak experience of all.

00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:02.481 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.481 --> 00:55:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Ah, ooh, mm, the birth,
the coming into being,

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and the dissolution,
the cycle of that.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is called the
four element syllable.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:18.634 align:middle line:90%
What is the fourth element?

00:55:18.634 --> 00:55:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Ah, ooh, mm, and the silence
out of which it comes,

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.080 align:middle line:84%
back into which it goes,
and which underlies it.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, my life is the ah, ooh, mm.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But there is a silence
that underlies it,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and that is what we
would call the immortal.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the mortal, and
that's the immortal.

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And there wouldn't be this
if there weren't that.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The meaning is
essentially wordless.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, words are always
qualifications and limitations.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, Joe, all we puny
human beings are left with is

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:84%
this miserable language,
beautiful though it is,

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that falls short of
trying to describe--

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
a peak experience

00:56:07.350 --> 00:56:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to break past all that every
now and then to realize, oh, ah,

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I think so.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:18.990 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.640 align:middle line:90%
