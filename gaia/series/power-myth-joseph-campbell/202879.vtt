>> So through the eyes love
attains the heart for the eyes

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%
are the scouts of the heart.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And the eyes go reconnoitering
for what would please the heart

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:90%
to possess.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And when they are in full
accord and firm, all three

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:84%
in one resolve, at that
time perfect love is

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
born from what the eyes have
made welcome to the heart.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:10%
For as all true loves know,
love is perfect kindness

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.825 align:middle line:10%
which is born there is no doubt
from the heart and the eyes.

>> If there were a giant map of
the world's great mythologies,

you could throw a dart and
anywhere it lands you find

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:84%
a love story, tales woven to
express the heart's deepest

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:90%
desire.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
ancient Babylonian myth

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of Pyramus and Thisbe,
two young lovers

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:84%
doomed by a chance
mistake and bad timing,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.600 align:middle line:84%
or Echo and Narcissus,
a trail of seductions

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that ends with a dagger
through a broken heart--

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:90%
just too many.

The study of the
mythology of love

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:84%
was a favorite of
Joseph Campbell.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
One of his best and
most famous essays

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
celebrates this
universal mystery.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Ask him where he
would like to start,

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
as I did during
our conversations

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
on the power of myth a
quarter of a century ago,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and he invariably answered,
in the Middle Ages.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
He relished in stories
of love and courtship

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
for the noble and gentle
hearts that managed somehow

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:90%
to transcend raw lust.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Because those stories
helped to create

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
a distinctive Western
consciousness,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
in time they would encourage
personal challenges

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:84%
to the dogma of
church and state.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So love, in other
words, as Joe said,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
could lead to revolution,
even against God.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Our first conversations
took place

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
at George Lucas's Skywalker
Ranch in California.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Like a weaver of
fine cloth, Campbell

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:84%
spun the tales and
legends of love

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.795 align:middle line:84%
to a marvelous tapestry
of the human psyche.

00:02:55.795 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.816 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about love.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's talk about love, fine.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's such a vast subject
that in mythology that if I had

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
come to you and said, let's talk
about love but where should we

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
begin, what would
your answer have been?

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I think my answer would
have been the troubadours

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
in the 12th century.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's begin there.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Why the troubadours?

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because they're the
first ones in the West that

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:84%
really considered love in the
sense that we think of it now,

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
as a person-to-person
relationship.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking
about romantic love?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It is the seizure that
comes in recognizing

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
as where your soul's
counterpart in the other person,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and that's what the
troubadours stood for,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and that has become the
ideal in our lives today.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>> What had it been before that?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the idea
of love as Eros,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:84%
the god who excites
you to sexual desire,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
this is not the
person-to-person thing,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
the falling in love in the way
the troubadours understood it.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a definition for Eros,
the erotic biological urge

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
as the zeal of the
organs for each other.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And the personal
factor doesn't matter.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Where did Eros come from?

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Eros is Cupid.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And in India, the God of love
is Kama, and he's no Cupid.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
He's a big, vigourous youth
with a bow and quiver of arrows.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And the names of the arrows
are such things as death

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
bringing, agony, and
open up, and really

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
he just drives
this thing into you

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
so that it's a total
physiological psychological

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.280 align:middle line:90%
explosion that takes place.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Then the other love,
the Christian love

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
of agape, spiritual love, love
thy neighbor as thyself, again,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
who the person is.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:90%
It's your neighbor.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:90%
You must have that kind of love.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But the kind of
seizure that comes

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
from the meeting of the eyes
as they say in the Troubadour

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
tradition, and the purely
personal person to person thing

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
as far as I know, it
originates as an ideal

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
to be lived for with
the Troubadours.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
>> You've said that what
happened in the 12th and 13th

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.710 align:middle line:84%
centuries was one of the most
important mutations of human

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
feeling and spiritual
consciousness that a new way

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
of experiencing love
came to expression.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.395 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was in opposition to
that ecclesiastical despotism

00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:57.195 align:middle line:90%
of the heart--

00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:57.995 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Which required people,
particularly young girls barely

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.607 align:middle line:84%
out of adolescence to
marry whomever the church

00:06:04.607 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
or their parents
wanted them to marry.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.135 align:middle line:84%
>> And what had this done
to the passion of the heart.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the-- to say a word
for the other before I do this,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.030 align:middle line:84%
the usual marriage in
traditional cultures is

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:90%
arranged for by the families.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not a person to
person decision at all.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is true to this day
in many parts of the world.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
This is not to say that
in arranged marriages

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:90%
of this kind, there is no love.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot of love.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
There's family love and a
rich love life on that level.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So in the Middle
Ages, of course,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that was the kind
of marriage that

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
was sanctified by the church.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea of real
person to person marriage

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:90%
was very dangerous.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Dangerous because
it was heresy.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It was not only heresy.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.120 align:middle line:90%
It was adultery.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was
punishable by death.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
the Tristan romance,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
that's the crucial romance--

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Tristan and Isolde?

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Isolde was engaged
to marry King Mark.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
They had never seen each other.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And Tristan is sent over
to fetch Isolde to Mark,

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and Isolde's mother
prepares a love potion

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
so that the two who
are to be married

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
will have real love
for each other.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And these two youngsters, they
think the love potion is wine,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and they drink it and then
are overtaken with this love.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But Brangaine, the
nurse of Isolde,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:90%
realized what had happened.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:84%
She went to Tristan and said
you have drunk your death.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And Tristan said
if by my death you

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
mean this agony of love that
is my life, if by my death

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
you mean the punishment that
we are to suffer if discovered,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
which is namely
execution, I accept that.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But if by my death you
mean eternal punishment

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
in the fires of hell in
which these people believed,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.025 align:middle line:90%
I accept that, too.

00:08:30.025 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That was quite--

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.044 align:middle line:90%
>> That's big stuff.

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:35.755 align:middle line:84%
>> For medieval Catholic because
they believed in a literal

00:08:35.755 --> 00:08:36.555 align:middle line:90%
hell.

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:37.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, these people did.

00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:38.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:38.698 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So what's the significance
of what he was saying?

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What he was saying is that
this love is bigger even than

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:90%
death, than pain, than anything.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.165 align:middle line:84%
This is the affirmation of
the pain of life in a big way.

00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would choose this pain
for love now even though it

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
might mean everlasting
pain and damnation in hell.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was a marked
change in how people--

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that is--

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
any life career that you
choose in following your bliss

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
should be chosen
with that sense.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can frighten me
off from this thing.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the beginning of the
Romantic idea of the Western

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.937 align:middle line:84%
individual taking matters
into his or her own hand.

00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, absolutely.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
You can see there are
examples in oriental stories

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of thing, but it
did not become a social system.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
It has now become the
ideal at any rate of love

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Love from one's
own experience?

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very mysterious
thing, that electric thing

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:90%
that happens.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the agony
that can follow,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
which is that which the
Troubadours celebrate,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
the agony of the love, the
sickness the doctors cannot

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
cure, the wounds that can be
healed only by the weapon that

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:90%
delivered the wound.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Meaning?

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the wound is the wound
of my passion and agony of love

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:84%
for this creature, and the only
one who can heal me is the one

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:90%
who delivered the blow.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So we often hurt most
the person we love and heal

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.442 align:middle line:90%
the hurt by the love that hurt?

00:10:18.442 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's-- something like that.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
That's the paradox of the job.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What did you mean, Joe,
when you said that the triumph

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
of Tristan's view of
love and vision of love,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
this beginning of romantic love
in the West was libido over

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:90%
credo?

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the credo I believe--

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and I believe not
only in the laws

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
but I believe that these
laws were instituted by God

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and there's no arguing with God.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
These laws are just heavy weight
on me, and disobeying those

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
is sin.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
my eternal character.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> And libido?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Libido is the
impulse to life.

00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Comes from where?

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Comes from the heart.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And the heart is what?

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart is the organ of
opening up to somebody else.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the human quality
as opposed to the animal

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:84%
qualities, which
have to do with--

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
primarily with self-interest.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Opening up to that
which is other

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is the opening of the
heart, and that's just

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:90%
the Troubadour's sort.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.947 align:middle line:90%
It is the opening of the heart.

00:11:35.947 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I can certainly
understand, though,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:84%
why the church was threatened
by this because how can you have

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:84%
a church if everyone's
libido is her own God?

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not?

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Why can't the
church handle that?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:84%
If you can sanctify a marriage
that has been arranged,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
why can't you
sanctify a marriage

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
where two people have
joined each other?

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So the courage to love became
the courage to affirm against

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.095 align:middle line:84%
tradition, whatever knowledge
stands confirmed in one's own

00:12:08.095 --> 00:12:08.895 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:10.485 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Why was that important in
the evolution of the West?

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was important in
that it gives the West this

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
accent as I've been
saying on the individual,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that he should have faith and
his experience and not simply

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
mouth terms that have come
to him from other mouths.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the great thing
in the West, the validity

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.310 align:middle line:84%
of the individual's
experience of what humanity

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
is, what life is,
what values are

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:90%
against the monolithic system.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there some of this in
the legend of the Holy Grail?

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Wolfram has a very
interesting statement

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:90%
about the origin of the Grail.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
He says the Grail was
brought from heaven

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:90%
by the neutral angels.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
There was the war in heaven
between God and Lucifer

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and the angelic hosts that
sided one group with Lucifer

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and the other with
God, pair of opposites,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:90%
good and evil, God and Satan.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.840 align:middle line:84%
The grail was brought
down through the middle,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
the way of the middle,
by the neutral angels.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the Grail
representing then?

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the grail becomes the--

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:90%
what we call it--

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:84%
that which is
attained and realized

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
by people who have
lived their own lives.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So the story very
briefly is of this--

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving it now
as Wolfram gives,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:90%
but this is just one version.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.870 align:middle line:84%
The Grail king was
a lovely young man,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:84%
but he had not
earned that position.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Grail represents
the fulfillment

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
of the highest
spiritual potentialities

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:90%
of the human consciousness.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And he was a lovely
young man, and he

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
rode forth from his castle
with the war cry amour.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And as he's riding
forth, a Muslim,

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.380 align:middle line:84%
a pagan warrior, the
Mohammedan warrior,

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the
woods, a knight.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And they both level their
lances at each other.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They drive at each other and
the lance of the Grail king

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
kills the Mohammedan but
the Mohammedan's lance

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:90%
castrates the Grail king.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that the
Christian separation of matter

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, of the
dynamism of life

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual, natural
grace and supernatural grace

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:90%
has really castrated nature.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And the European mind,
the European life,

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
has been as it were emasculated
by this true spirituality,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
which would have come
from this has been killed.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And then what did
the pagan represent?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
He was a person from
the suburbs of Eden.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:90%
He was regarded as a nature man.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And on the head of his lance
was written the word grail.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
That is to say nature
intends the grail.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual life is the
bouquet of natural life,

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:47.060 align:middle line:84%
not a supernatural
thing imposed upon it.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the impulses of nature
are what give authenticity

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
to life, not obeying rules come
from a supernatural authority.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.795 align:middle line:90%
That's the sense of the Grail.

00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Grail that these
romantic legends were searching

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
for is the union, once again,
of what had been divided,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
the peace that
comes from joining?

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The Grail becomes symbolic
of an authentic life that has

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
lived in terms of
its own volition,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its
own impulse system,

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
which carries it between the
pairs of opposites of good

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:90%
and evil, light and dark.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Wolfram starts his
epic with a short poem

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
saying every act has both
good and evil results.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
Every act in life yields pairs
of opposites in its results.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
The best we can do is
lean toward the light

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:90%
as they intend the light.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And what the light is that of
the harmonious relationships

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that come from compassion
with suffering, understanding

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:90%
of the other person.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:90%
This is what the Grail's about.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When we say God is love, does
that have anything to do with

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
romantic love?

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Does mythology ever link
romantic love in God?

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's what it did do.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
Love was a divine
visitation, and that's

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:90%
why it was superior to marriage.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
That was the Troubadour idea.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:84%
If God is love, well,
then love is God.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's that wonderful
passage in Corinthians by Paul

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.900 align:middle line:84%
where he says love bareth all
things, endureth all things.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
the same business.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.725 align:middle line:90%
Love knows no pain.

00:17:35.725 --> 00:17:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet one of my favorite
stories of mythology is out

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:84%
of Persia where there's the
idea that Lucifer was condemned

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to hell because he
loved God so much.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that's a basic
Muslim idea about Iblis--

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that's the Muslim
name for Satan--

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:90%
being God's greatest lover.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Why was Satan
thrown into hell?

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the standard story is that
when God created the angels,

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
he told them to bow
to none but himself.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Then he created man who he
regarded as a higher form

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:84%
than the angels, and he asked
the angels then to serve man.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:90%
And Satan would not bow to man.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Now this is interpreted
in the Christian tradition

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:84%
as I recall from my
boyhood instruction

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:90%
as being the egotism of Satan.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:90%
He would not bow to man.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But in this view, he
could not bow to man

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:90%
because of his love for God.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:90%
He could bow only to God.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And then God says
get out of my sight.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Now the worst of the
pains of hell in so far

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
as hell has been
described is the absence

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.610 align:middle line:90%
of the beloved, which is God.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So how does Iblis sustain
the situation in hell?

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
By the memory of the echo
of God's voice when God said

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:90%
go to hell.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
great sign of love.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's certainly
true in life

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that the greatest
tale one can know

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
is to be separated
from the one you love.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I've like the
Persian myth for so long.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Satan is God's lover.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And he is separated
from God, and that's

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:90%
the real pain of Satan.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You once took the saying
of Jesus love your enemies

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and pray for those who persecute
you so that you may be sons

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.690 align:middle line:84%
of your father who's in heaven
before he makes the sun to rise

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:84%
on the evil and the good
and sins reign on the just

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and the unjust, you once
took that to be the highest,

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
the noblest, the boldest
of the Christian teachings.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.975 align:middle line:90%
Do you still feel that way?

00:20:01.975 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the main
teaching of Christianity is

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:90%
love your enemies.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Hard to do.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, well, that's it.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
When Peter drew his sword and
cut off of the servant's ear

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:90%
there in the Gethsemane affair.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said put
up your sword, Peter,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:90%
and put the ear back on.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Peter has been drawing
his sword ever since.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And one can speak about
the Petrine or Christian,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Christianity in that sense, and
I would say the main doctrine

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and Christianity is
the doctrine of agape,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of a true love
for he who is here

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:90%
of-- him who is your enemy.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> How does one love one's
enemy without condoning what

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
the enemy does,
accepting his aggression?

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll tell
you how to do that.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Do not pluck the moat
from your enemies' eye

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:84%
but pluck the beam
from your own.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Now I have a friend whom I met
by chance, a young Buddhist

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.765 align:middle line:90%
monk from Tibet.

00:21:15.765 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
In 1959, the
communists crashed down

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and bombed the palace of the
Dalai Lama, bombarded Lhasa

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and people murdered and
all that kind of thing.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And the escape, he escaped at
the time of the Dalai Lama.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And those monasteries,
there were monasteries

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
with 5,000 monks, 6,000
monks all wiped out,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:90%
tortured and everything else.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard one word of
incrimination of the Chinese

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:90%
from that young man.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely no
condemnation of the Chinese

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this from
the Dalai Lama himself.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
You will not hear a
word of condemnation.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
This recognition
of the way of life

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
through which the
vitality of the Spirit

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
is moving in its
own way, these men

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:84%
are sufferers of
terrific violence,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:90%
and there's no animosity.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I learned religion from that.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Do most of the stories of
mythology from whatever culture

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
say that suffering is
intrinsically a part of life

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.655 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
no way around it?

00:22:35.655 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'd be willing
to say that they do.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of anything
now that says if you're going

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:90%
to live, you won't suffer.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It'll tell you how to understand
and bear and interpret

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:90%
suffering.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:90%
That it will do.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And when the Buddha says there
is escape from suffering,

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.430 align:middle line:84%
the escape from
sorrow is nirvana.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Nirvana is a
psychological position

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:09.300 align:middle line:84%
where you are untouched
by desire and fear.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> But is that realistic?

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.580 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, certainly.

00:23:13.312 --> 00:23:15.495 align:middle line:90%
>> And your life becomes what?

00:23:15.495 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Harmonious, well-centered,
and affirmative of life.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Even with suffering?

00:23:22.485 --> 00:23:23.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a passage in Paul's
epistle to the Philippians,

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:90%
isn't there?

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Be as Christ, for Christ did
not think godhood something

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to be hung on to, be
clung to but let go

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and came down and took life
in the form of a servant,

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:90%
a servant even unto death.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd say come in and accept
the suffering and affirm it.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So you would agree with
Abelard in the 12th century who

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:07.110 align:middle line:84%
said that Jesus's death on the
cross was not as a ransom paid,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
as a penalty applied, but it
was an act of at one-ment,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
at tonement, at
one with the race.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the most sophisticated
interpretation of why Christ

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:90%
had to be crucified.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Abelard's idea was that this--

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is connected with
the Grail king and everything

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:25.830 align:middle line:90%
else--

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that the coming and of
Christ to be crucified

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and illustrating thus
the suffering of life

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
removes man's mind
from commitment

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:84%
to the things of this
world in compassion.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
It's in compassion with
Christ that we turn to Christ.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the injured one
becomes the Savior.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:84%
It is the suffering
that evokes the humanity

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.451 align:middle line:90%
of the human heart.

00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:10%
>> So you would agree with
Abelard that mankind yearning

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:10%
for God and God yearning for
mankind in compassion met

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.710 align:middle line:10%
at that cross?

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And by contemplating
the cross, you

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
are contemplating the
true mystery of life

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and that love for this
experience, no matter

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:84%
how horrific the
experience, the love for it.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's joy
and pain in love?

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there is.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Love, you might say, is
the turning point of life.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And since all life is
sorrowful, so is love.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger the love,
the more that pain but love

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:90%
bears all things.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Love itself is a pain
you might say that is

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:90%
the pain of being truly alive.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:58.272 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.272 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Once upon a time so long ago
it no longer matters how long

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
ago, the feminine figure of
the goddess ruled mythology

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:90%
as the equal of the male.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks even gave
her top billing.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
From chaos, they
said from nothing

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:84%
came Mother Earth known
as Gaia and sky, Uranus.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They bedded, and
from their coupling

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
came six twins
known as the Titans

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and three giants
known as Cyclopes,

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:90%
each with 50 heads and 100 arms.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Uranus was disgusted and forced
him to return to their mother's

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:84%
womb whereupon an
indignant Gaia set out

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.110 align:middle line:84%
to make him pay for the
insult. When Uranus came

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.180 align:middle line:84%
to their bedroom for
his usual favors,

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%
she recruited one of their
sons to make a sickle,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and together they
took from Uranus

00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:84%
what he was most
unwilling to give up

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and dropped the bloody
thing in the sea.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The lesson was not
lost on the Greeks.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:84%
It isn't nice to fool
with Mother Nature.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell liked that
story and told it to me

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:84%
when we were talking one day
about how patriarchal authority

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:84%
finally drove the goddess from
the Pantheon of imagination.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Somehow the old guys
figured that if they wanted

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.380 align:middle line:84%
to control the world, they
had to change the metaphors,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and the goddess had to go.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.910 align:middle line:84%
She remained the
symbol of fertility,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:84%
crucial to humanity's survival
but no equal except rarely

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
in the exercise of power.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:84%
The repercussions have
played out down the centuries

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and are still with us.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.335 align:middle line:84%
We return now to
our conversation.

00:27:28.335 --> 00:27:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The Lord's Prayer begins
our father which art in heaven.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it have
begun our mother?

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a metaphorical image.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
This is a symbolic image.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And to make the point that
it's not your father--

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
your physical father, we have
our father who art in heaven.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.950 align:middle line:84%
But heaven again is a symbolic
idea where it would heaven be.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:90%
It is no place.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:84%
All of the references of
religious and mythological

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
images are to planes
of consciousness

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:84%
of fields of experience
potential in the human spirit.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And these are to evoke
attitudes and experiences that

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:84%
are appropriate to a meditation
on the mystery of the source

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of your own being I would say.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
systems of religion

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:84%
where the mother is the
prime parent, the source,

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and she's really a
more immediate parent

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:84%
than the father because one
is born from the mother,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and then the first
experience of any infant

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is the mother so that
the image of woman

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:90%
is the image of the world.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
You might say that
mythology is simply

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:84%
a translation of the
world into a mother image.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.735 align:middle line:84%
We talk of Mother
Earth and so forth.

00:28:56.735 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> But what happened
along the way, Joe,

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to this reverence that in
primitive societies was

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
directed toward the goddess
figure, the great goddess,

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:90%
the Mother Earth?

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.830 align:middle line:90%
What happened to that?

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> That comes in primarily with
agriculture in the agricultural

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.660 align:middle line:90%
societies.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Fertility and all of that?

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It has to do with Earth.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The human woman does give
birth as the Earth gives birth

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.820 align:middle line:90%
to the plants.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:84%
She gives nourishment
as the plants do.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So woman magic and Earth
magic are the same.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.030 align:middle line:90%
They are related.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And the personification
then of this energy

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.290 align:middle line:84%
which gives birth to
forms and nourishes forms

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.146 align:middle line:90%
is properly female.

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:50.122 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.610 --> 00:30:00.396 align:middle line:84%
And so it is in the agricultural
world of ancient Mesopotamia,

00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:04.480 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian Nile, but also
in the earlier planting

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:84%
culture systems that the
goddess is the mythic form that

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.170 align:middle line:90%
is dominant.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:22.300 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of this obvious
perception of creation issue--

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
goddess as the creator,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
it's her own very body
that is the universe.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.110 align:middle line:84%
She is identical
with the universe.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And in Egypt, you have
the mother heavens,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Nut-- the goddess Nut, who
represents the whole heavenly

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I was really taken when we
went to Egypt upon first seeing

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
the figure of Nut in the
ceiling of one of those temples.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I know the temple.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's overwhelming.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's one scene of
her swallowing the sun.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is that she swallows
the sun in the West and gives

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:84%
birth to the sun in the East,
and it passes through her body

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.680 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.665 align:middle line:90%
And so she is the heavens.

00:31:19.665 --> 00:31:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So it would be natural
for people trying to explain

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
the wonders of the universe
to look to the female figure

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.385 align:middle line:84%
as the explanation for what
they saw in their own lives.

00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only that but then when
you move to a philosophical

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:84%
point of view, the female
represents what in the Kantian

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
terminology, we call the
forms of sensibility,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.990 align:middle line:84%
the female represents
time and space itself.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:84%
She is time and space,
and the mystery beyond her

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:90%
is beyond pairs of opposites.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't male,
and it isn't female.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It neither is nor isn't,
but everything is within her

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:84%
so that the gods
are her children.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Everything you can think
of, everything you can see

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is the production
of the goddess.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's wonderful story.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The Vedic gods are together,
and they see a strange amorphous

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.110 align:middle line:84%
thing down the way
like a smoky fog.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And they say what's that.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what it is.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And Agni, the god of fire, says
I'll go find out who that is.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
So he goes up to this smoky
thing, and he says who are you.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And from the smoky thing,
this voice says who are you.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And he says I'm Agni.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm the lord of fire.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I can burn anything.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And out of the fog there
comes a piece of straw.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.960 align:middle line:90%
It falls on the ground.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It says let's see you burn that.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:90%
He can't burn it.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:90%
He goes back.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:90%
He says this is strange.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, Vayu, the lord
of wind, says I'll try.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:90%
So he goes and the same thing.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:90%
I can blow anything around.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Throws it down.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's see you blow that.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:90%
But he can't.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:07.940 align:middle line:90%
He goes back.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Then a woman arrives, a
beautiful, mysterious mystic

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:90%
woman.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.486 align:middle line:84%
And she instructs the gods
and tells them who that is.

00:33:20.486 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:84%
That is the ultimate mystery of
being from which you boys have

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
received your strength, and he
can turn it on or off for you.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And there she comes as the
one who illuminates the gods

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.410 align:middle line:84%
themselves concerning
the ultimate ground

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.835 align:middle line:90%
of their own being.

00:33:37.835 --> 00:33:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the female wisdom.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the female as
the giver of forms.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:84%
She is the one who
gave the forms,

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and she knows where
they came from.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder what it would have
meant to us if somewhere along

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.570 align:middle line:84%
the way we had begun the
prayer our mother instead

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:90%
of our father.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.005 align:middle line:84%
What psychological difference
would it have made?

00:33:58.005 --> 00:34:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it makes a
psychological difference

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.960 align:middle line:84%
in the character
of the cultures.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:90%

birth of civilization

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Near East

the Nile, the Tigris Euphrates,
and then over in India

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.690 align:middle line:84%
the Indus Valley and
later the Ganges.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the world
of the goddess.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.150 align:middle line:84%
All these rivers have
goddess names finally.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.060 align:middle line:90%

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.659 align:middle line:84%
These fighting people
are hurting people.

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The Semis are herders
of goats and sheep

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and the Indo
Europeans of cattle.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:90%
They were formerly the hunters.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:84%
They translate a
hunting mythology

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:50.000 align:middle line:84%
into a herding mythology,
but it's animal oriented.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
hunters, you have killers.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
herders, you have

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.100 align:middle line:84%
killers because they're
always in movement, nomadic,

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
coming into conflict
with other people

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and they have to conquer
the area they move into.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:84%
This comes into the Near East,
and this brings in the warrior

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:15.215 align:middle line:90%
gods like Zeus, like Yahweh.

00:35:15.215 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The sword and death
instead of fertility?

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, particularly
the Hebrews.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:25.820 align:middle line:84%
They really wipe
out the goddess.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.880 align:middle line:84%
The term for the goddess,
the Canaanite goddess

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that's used in the Old
Testament is the abomination.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And so many of the
Hebrew kings are

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.540 align:middle line:84%
condemned in the Old Testament
for having worship down

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:90%
the mountaintops.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the goddess.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
very strong accent

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
against the goddess
in the Hebrew,

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:84%
which you do not find
in the Indo-European.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
There you have Zeus
marrying the goddess,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and then the two play together.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an extreme case
that we have in the Bible,

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and our own Western
subjugation of the female

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.245 align:middle line:84%
is really I think a function
of biblical thinking.

00:36:13.245 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Because when you substitute
the male for the female,

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.730 align:middle line:84%
you get a different psychology,

if the male is on top
like this and the female

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.660 align:middle line:84%
is the subordinate
all the way, you

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.820 align:middle line:84%
have a totally different
system from that when

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:38.310 align:middle line:90%
the two are facing each other.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's permissible in your
culture to do what your gods do

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:90%
so you just--

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's exactly it.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So I would see three
situations here,

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:84%
one the early one
of the Shia goddess

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:57.400 align:middle line:84%
when the male is hardly
a significant divinity--

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:90%
she is the total thing--

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and then this other one of
the Hebrew of the goddess--

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:84%
the male the total thing-- in
fact, he takes over her role--

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and finally then
the classical one

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.030 align:middle line:90%
where the two are into action.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> There are women today who say
that the spirit of the goddess

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.072 align:middle line:84%
has been in exile for 5,000
years since the events that

00:37:22.072 --> 00:37:22.872 align:middle line:90%
you--

00:37:22.872 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well not that-- you can't put
it that far back, 5,000 years.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.690 align:middle line:84%
She was a very potent
figure in Hellenistic times

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Mediterranean.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And she came back with the
Virgin in the Roman Catholic

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.120 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a
tradition with the goddess

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:84%
celebrated any more
beautifully and

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:49.270 align:middle line:84%
marvelously than in the
12th and 13th century

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.525 align:middle line:84%
French cathedrals, every one
of which is called Notre Dame.

00:37:52.525 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the Virgin birth?

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly the goddess
reappears in the form

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of the chaste and pure vessel
chosen for God's action.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in the history
of Western religions,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
this is an extremely
interesting development.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin birth comes in by
way of the Greek tradition.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:84%
When you read your four
gospels, the only one

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:20.590 align:middle line:84%
with the Virgin birth in it is
the gospel according to Luke.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.465 align:middle line:90%
And Luke was a Greek.

00:38:22.465 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was in the Greek
tradition images, legends,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:90%
myths of Virgin birth?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All of them.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The leader and the swan and
Persephone and the serpent

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and this one and that one and
the other one, the Virgin birth

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.660 align:middle line:90%
is represented throughout.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> This was not a new idea
then in Bethlehem in--

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.900 align:middle line:84%
What is the meaning
of the Virgin birth?

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.910 align:middle line:84%
In India, there is this
system of the Kundalini

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:57.280 align:middle line:84%
as it's called, the
idea of the centers--

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
psychological
centers up the spine,

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and they represent a
psychological planes of concern

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.530 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness and action.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
First is that the rectum, and
this is that of alimentation.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The serpent represents
this, a traveling esophagus

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:84%
going on just eating,
eating, eating, eating.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of us, we wouldn't
be here if we weren't eating.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the second center is
that the sex organs center,

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and that's the urge
to procreation.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The third center's called--
is that the navels, and this

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
is where you eat
and want to consume.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the
alimentary eating.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the mastering and smashing
and trashing of others you see.

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:90%
This is the aggressive mood.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:40:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Now the first is
an animal instinct.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.490 align:middle line:84%
The second is an
animal instinct.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:90%
The third is an animal instinct.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And these three centers are
located in the pelvic basin.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:10%
The next one is at the
level of the heart,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.650 align:middle line:10%
and this is the
opening of compassion

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:10%
and there you move out of
the field of animal action

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:27.250 align:middle line:10%
into a field that is
properly human and spiritual.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Now in each of these centers,
there is a symbolic form.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.940 align:middle line:84%
At the base, the
first one, there

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is the form of the
lingham and yoni, the male

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and female organs
in conjunction.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.390 align:middle line:84%
At the heart chakra,
there is again

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
the male and female organs
in conjunction but in gold.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:90%
This is the Virgin birth.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the birth of spiritual
man out of the animal man.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And it happens?

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are awakened
at the level of the heart

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to compassion and suffering
with the other person.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning
of humanity.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And the meditations
of religion properly

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:84%
are on that level,
the heart level.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> You say it's the beginning of
humanity, but in these stories,

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.340 align:middle line:84%
that's the moment
when gods are born.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.595 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin birth, it's a God
who emerges from that chemistry.

00:41:29.595 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And you know who that God is?

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.560 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.590 align:middle line:84%
All of the symbols in
mythology refer to you.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:41.030 align:middle line:84%
You can get stuck out there
and think it's all out there.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you're thinking of
Jesus and all the sentiments

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:90%
about how he suffered and awe.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:50.890 align:middle line:84%
What that suffering is is what
ought to be going on in you.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Have you been reborn?

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Have you died to
your animal nature

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and come to life as
a human incarnation?

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it significant
that this is of a virgin?

00:42:03.175 --> 00:42:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is that the
begetter is the spirit.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It is a spiritual birth.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:16.205 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin conceived of
the word through the ear.

00:42:16.205 --> 00:42:18.925 align:middle line:84%
>> The word came like
a shaft of light.

00:42:18.925 --> 00:42:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And now the Buddha was
born from his mother's side

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.740 align:middle line:84%
at the level of
the heart chakra.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:28.180 align:middle line:90%
That's a symbolic birth.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.045 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't born from his mother's
side, but symbolically he was.

00:42:32.045 --> 00:42:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Christ came
the way you and I come.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, but of a Virgin.

00:42:39.196 --> 00:42:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is a
power greater than.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And then according to
Roman Catholic doctrine,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.850 align:middle line:90%
her virginity was restored.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So nothing happened
physically you might say.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not a physical birth.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.770 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolic of a
spiritual transformation.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Virgin birth's about.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And so deities are
born that way who

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.400 align:middle line:84%
represent beings who act
in terms of compassion

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and not in terms of the
lower three centers.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> If you go back
into antiquity,

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:18.140 align:middle line:84%
do you find images of
the Madonna as the mother

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Savior child?

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what you have as the
model for the Madonna actually

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:30.680 align:middle line:84%
is Isis with her child
Horus at her breast.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.680 align:middle line:84%
This was the actual model
for the Madonna symbol.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Isis?

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.025 align:middle line:90%
Tell me that story.

00:43:36.025 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a prime myth in
this period of the goddess

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
as the redeemer, the one who
goes in quest of the lost

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:84%
spouse or lover, and through
her loyalty and descent

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.120 align:middle line:84%
into the realm of
death recovers him.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Isis and her husband
Osiris were twins who

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:90%
were born of the goddess Nut.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And their younger relatives
were Set and Nephthys, who

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.640 align:middle line:90%
are also twins born from Nut.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Set planned to kill
his brother Osiris.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And he took Osiris's
measurements secretly

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and had a wonderful
sarcophagus built

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.840 align:middle line:90%
that would exactly fit Osiris.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So there was a hilarious
party in progress one

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:84%
time among the gods, and Set
traps in this sarcophagus.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And he says anyone who
this perfectly fits

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.140 align:middle line:90%
can have it as his sarcophagus.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And everybody at
the party tried,

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and when Osiris got in, of
course, it perfectly fit.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Just at that time, 72
accomplices come rushing out,

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and they clapped the lid on,
strap it together, and throw it

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.170 align:middle line:90%
in the Nile.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the
death of the god.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you have a death of an
incarnation of god like this,

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have a resurrection.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.270 align:middle line:90%
You can wait for that.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So he goes floating
down the Nile

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:21.170 align:middle line:90%
and is washed ashore in Syria.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And a beautiful tree
grows up and incorporates

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.060 align:middle line:84%
the sarcophagus
in its own trunk.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:33.551 align:middle line:84%
So this wonderful tree
with glorious aroma

00:45:33.551 --> 00:45:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and the local king has
just had a son born to him.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's also at the same
time going to build a palace.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:84%
The aroma of this
tree is so wonderful,

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
he cuts it down and brings
it in to be a central pillar

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.715 align:middle line:90%
in the main room of the palace.

00:45:52.715 --> 00:45:55.310 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.310 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Poor little Isis, whose husband
has been thrown into the Nile,

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.060 align:middle line:84%
starts this wonderful
quest for Osiris.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So she comes to the place
where the palace is and learns

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:84%
of the wonderful aroma, and
she suspects this is Osiris.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And she gets a job as nurse
to the just born little child.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, she lets the child
nurse from her finger.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And she loves the
little child, and she

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:90%
decides to give it immortality.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So she does this by placing
him in the fireplace,

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and the fire to burn away
gradually his mortal body.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But being a goddess, she
could keep that from killing.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And when that would happen,
she would convert herself

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.670 align:middle line:84%
into a swallow and fly
mournfully around the pillar

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:54.890 align:middle line:90%
where her husband is.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, one evening the child's
mother came into this room

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.120 align:middle line:84%
while the scene was in progress,
saw her child in the fireplace,

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.600 align:middle line:84%
let out a scream, and
that broke the spell

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and they had to rescue the
child from incineration.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the
swallow had turned

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
into this gorgeous nurse,
Isis, and the nurse

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.600 align:middle line:84%
gave an explanation
of the situation.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And she said, by the way,
my husband is in that pillar

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:84%
there, and I'd be
grateful if you could just

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.150 align:middle line:90%
let me take it home.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So the king came in,
and he said certainly.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So he removes the
pillar, gives it to Isis,

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and is put on a barge.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So on the way back
to the Nile, she

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:84%
removes the lid, the
cover of the sarcophagus

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and lies on top
of her dead spouse

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.640 align:middle line:84%
and conceives of
her dead spouse--

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.150 align:middle line:84%
this is an image that occurs in
Egyptian on all the time-- out

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:02.540 align:middle line:84%
of death comes life and all
of this kind of business.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And when they land, she
in the papyrus swamp

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:13.610 align:middle line:84%
gives birth to her child
Horus with the dead Osiris

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.470 align:middle line:90%
beside her.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the motif for
the Madonna actually.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.210 align:middle line:90%
It becomes the Madonna.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:25.310 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian symbology,
Isis represents the throne.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh sits on
the throne of Isis

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:84%
as the child sits
on the mother lap.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you look in the
Cathedral of Chartres

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:39.470 align:middle line:84%
in the west portal, you
will see the Madonna

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.830 align:middle line:84%
as the throne with
the little child Jesus

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.050 align:middle line:90%
as the world emperor on her lap.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That is the same image
that's come over.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And you say the Christian
fathers took this image?

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Definitely and
they really say so.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You read the second
letter of Peter,

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.440 align:middle line:84%
and he says those
forms which were merely

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.210 align:middle line:84%
mythological forms in the past
are now incarnate and actual

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.640 align:middle line:90%
in our savior.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.620 align:middle line:84%
They were-- there
was a mythology

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.620 align:middle line:84%
of the savior, the dead
and resurrected God,

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's associated with
the moon, which dies

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and is resurrected every month.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
three nights dark,

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and you have Christ
three nights in the tomb

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and three days in the tomb
and all this kind of thing.

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It's an intentional saying that
which was merely talked about

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:32.380 align:middle line:90%
is now fact.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows what the
date of Christmas ought to be,

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's put on the date of
the summer-- of the winter

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
solstice when the
nights begin to be

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.600 align:middle line:84%
shorter and the days
longer, the birth of light.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a idea
of death to the past

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and birth to the future in
our lives and in our thinking

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.080 align:middle line:84%
all the time, death
to the animal nature,

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.050 align:middle line:84%
birth to the spiritual,
and these symbols

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.080 align:middle line:84%
are talking about it
one way or another.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So when the--

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And the goddess is the
one who brings it about.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:84%
The second birth is through the
second mother, Notre Dame de

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Paris, Notre Dame the
Chartres, our Mother Church.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We are reborn by entering
and leaving a church.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't
mean physically.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.140 align:middle line:90%
It means--

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Spiritually.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That there's a power
that's unique to the feminine

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.780 align:middle line:90%
principle?

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be put that way.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.610 align:middle line:84%
You can-- it's not
necessarily unique to her.

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:38.270 align:middle line:10%
You can have a rebirth
through the male also.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But using this
system of symbols,

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.310 align:middle line:84%
the woman becomes
the regenerator.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There's that wonderful saying
in the New Testament of Jesus,

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.260 align:middle line:84%
in Jesus there is
no male or female.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:53.810 align:middle line:84%
In the ultimate sense of
things, there is neither.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's-- it would have to be.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:03.080 align:middle line:84%
If Jesus represents the
source of our being,

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.410 align:middle line:84%
we are all as it were
thoughts in the mind of Jesus.

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:10.415 align:middle line:84%
It is the word that has
become flesh in us, too.

00:51:10.415 --> 00:51:14.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You and I would possess
characteristics that are both

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.755 align:middle line:90%
male and female.

00:51:15.755 --> 00:51:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually the body
does, but sometime in the fetal

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:24.425 align:middle line:84%
period, it becomes apparent
that this is going to be male

00:51:24.425 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:90%
and this is going to be female.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it's a
kind of neutral body

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.645 align:middle line:84%
with the potentialities
for either inflection.

00:51:31.645 --> 00:51:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So all through life, we are
honoring or suppressing one

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.520 align:middle line:90%
or the other?

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that yin
yang figure from China,

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.570 align:middle line:84%
in the dark fish or whatever
you want to call it,

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.770 align:middle line:84%
there's a light spot, and in the
light one, there's a dark spot.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:50.450 align:middle line:90%
That's how they can relate.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.440 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't relate at all
to something that of which

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:84%
you did not
participate into which

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.530 align:middle line:90%
you did not participate at all.

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:02.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why the idea of
God as the absolute other

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.500 align:middle line:90%
is a ridiculous idea.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.440 align:middle line:84%
There could be no
relationship to that

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.600 align:middle line:90%
which is absolute other.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The question arises in
discussing the male/female

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:18.350 align:middle line:84%
principle, the Virgin birth, the
spiritual power that gives us

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.290 align:middle line:84%
the second birth, the wise
people of all time have said

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.680 align:middle line:84%
that we can live the good life
if we learn in fact to live

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.000 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But how does one learn
to live spiritually

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.040 align:middle line:90%
when one is of the flesh?

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Remember Paul said the
desires of the flesh

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.380 align:middle line:84%
are against the spirit and
the desires of the spirit

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.730 align:middle line:90%
are against the flesh?

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.175 align:middle line:84%
How do we learn to
live spiritually?

00:52:40.175 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was the-- in
ancient times and in primitive

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.170 align:middle line:84%
times the business
of the teacher.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:53.960 align:middle line:84%
He was to give you the
clues to a spiritual life.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.740 align:middle line:84%
That was what the
priest was for.

00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Also that was what
the ritual was for.

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:05.110 align:middle line:84%
A ritual can be defined
as an enactment of a myth.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:09.310 align:middle line:84%
By participating in
a good sound ritual,

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you are actually experiencing
a mythological life.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's out of that that one
can learn to live spiritually.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.693 align:middle line:84%
>> These stories of mythology
actually point the way

00:53:23.693 --> 00:53:24.610 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual life.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.190 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have a clue.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:31.660 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have a
road map of some kind,

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and these are all around us.

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:34.900 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And the road map to which the
goddess stories are pointing is

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the map of elevating the
spiritual to an equality with

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the physical so that you
live in union with those two?

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.850 align:middle line:84%
There you come to the real
sanctity of the Earth itself

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:58.510 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
body of the goddess.

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:05.710 align:middle line:84%
When Yahweh creates,
he creates of the Earth

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.990 align:middle line:90%
and breathes his life into it.

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:10.870 align:middle line:90%
He's not there.

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.690 align:middle line:90%
She's there.

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Your body is her body.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's that
kind of identity.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's why I'm not
so sure that the future

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of the race and the salvation
of the journey is in space.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it is well right
here on Earth in the body,

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:30.385 align:middle line:90%
in the womb of all of our being.

00:54:30.385 --> 00:54:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it certainly is.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:36.050 align:middle line:84%
When you go out into space, what
you're carrying is your body,

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and if that hasn't
been transformed,

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.390 align:middle line:84%
space won't
transform it for you.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But thinking about space may
help you to realize something.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You've certainly
thought about space.

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.740 align:middle line:84%
In this wonderful
passage, you're

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:52.980 align:middle line:84%
describing a page out of
the National Geographic

atlas of the world, but you
read this and something happened

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.686 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:54:56.686 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:84%
>> What these pages opened to
me was the vision of a universe

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:06.220 align:middle line:84%
of unimaginable magnitude
and inconceivable violence.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:10.180 align:middle line:10%
Billions upon billions literally
of roaring thermonuclear

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:12.970 align:middle line:10%
furnaces scattering
from each other,

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:18.490 align:middle line:10%
each thermonuclear furnace being
a star and our sun among them.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Many of them actually
blowing themselves to pieces,

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:24.910 align:middle line:84%
littering the outermost reaches
of space with dust and gas

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:27.520 align:middle line:84%
out of which new stars
with circling planets

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.900 align:middle line:90%
are being born right now.

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And then for still more remote
distances beyond all these,

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.280 align:middle line:84%
there come murmurs,
microwaves which

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.940 align:middle line:84%
are echoes of the greatest
cataclysmic explosion of all,

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.730 align:middle line:84%
namely, the Big
Bang of creation,

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:44.800 align:middle line:84%
which according
to recent records

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.720 align:middle line:84%
must have occurred some
18 billion years ago.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.730 align:middle line:84%
That's where we are,
kiddo, and realize that.

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:55.330 align:middle line:84%
You realize how really
important you are.

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:59.740 align:middle line:84%
One little micro bit in
this great magnitude.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And then out of that
must come the experience

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that you and that are
in some sense, one,

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.255 align:middle line:90%
and you partake of all of that.

00:56:07.255 --> 00:56:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And it begins here.

00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It begins here.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:13.570 align:middle line:90%
