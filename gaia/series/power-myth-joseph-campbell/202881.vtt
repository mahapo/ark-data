>> The president in Washington
sends word that he wishes

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.290 align:middle line:10%
to buy our land.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But how can you buy
or sell the sky?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.420 align:middle line:90%
The land.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.910 align:middle line:90%
The idea is strange to us.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Every part of this Earth
is sacred to my people.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Every shining pine
needle, every sandy shore,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
every mist in the dark
woods, every meadow,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:84%
all are holy in the memory
and experience of my people.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:90%
We're proud of the Earth.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And it is part of us.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The perfume flowers
are our sisters.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
The bear, the deer, the great
eagle, these are our brothers.

Each ghostly reflection in
the clear water of the lakes

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
tells of events and memories
in the life of my people.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The water's memory is the
voice of my father's father.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
The rivers are our brothers.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.540 align:middle line:84%
They carry our canoes
and feed our children.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
If we sell you
our land, remember

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%
that the air is precious to us.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That the air shares its spirit
with all the life it supports.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The wind that gave our
grandfather his first breath

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
also receives his last sigh.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
This, we know.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The Earth does
not belong to man.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Man belongs to the Earth.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:84%
All things are connected like
the blood that unites us all.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Man did not weave
the web of life.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:90%
He is merely a strand in it.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it does to the
web, he does to himself.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Your destiny is a mystery to us.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
What will happen when the
buffalo are all slaughtered?

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
What will happen when the
secret corners of the forest

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
are heavy with the
scent of many men?

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And the view of the ripe hills
is blotted by talking wires?

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The end of living and the
beginning of survival.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:84%
When the last red man has
vanished with his wilderness

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and his memory is only the
shadow of a cloud moving

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
across the prairie, will
these shores and forests still

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:90%
be here?

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Will there be any spirit
of my people left?

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.390 align:middle line:84%
We love this Earth, as a newborn
loves his mother's heartbeat.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So if we sell you our land,
love it as we have loved it.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Care for it as
we've cared for it.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Hold in your mind the
memory of the land

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:90%
as it is when you receive it.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Preserve the land
for all children.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:90%
And love it as God loves us all.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
One thing we know,
there's only one God.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
No man, be he red man or
white man, can be a part.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.880 align:middle line:90%
We are brothers, after all.

>> Joseph Campbell reading the
famous speech said to have been

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
delivered in 1854 by the
Native American visionary Chief

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Seattle.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Campbell immersed himself in the
mythology of American Indians.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Their language,
stories, and rituals.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
He felt a kinship with
their understanding

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:84%
of the covenant between
human beings and nature.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
An accord based on reverence and
respect required by the reality

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
that we humans live off our
environment and not just in it.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
He often told the story of the
young Sioux Indian Black Elk

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.240 align:middle line:84%
who provided us with one
of the great insights

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
into the power of
myth and symbols

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:90%
to change how we see the world.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
In a state of ecstasy,
Black Elk saw himself

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
on the central
mountain of the world

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and it turned out to be
Harney Peak in South Dakota.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, but the
central Mountain is everywhere.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, every one
of us is on a sacred site,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:90%
if only we recognize it.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.190 align:middle line:84%
You will hear Joseph Campbell
expound on that story later

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:90%
in this broadcast.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And you will, I
believe, understand

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:84%
why he wanted every
new generation

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover the power of
myth to awaken in all of us

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
a sense of wonder at
the world around us.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
When we met for
these conversations,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
he was working on a monumental
multi-volume historical atlas

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:90%
of world mythology.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
In this and all his work,
he took his inspiration

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
from the English poet and
mystic William Blake, who said,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.595 align:middle line:84%
"arise and drink your bliss, for
everything that lives is holy."

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:90%

>> What does it mean
to have a sacred place?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a term
I like to use now,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
as an absolute necessity
for anybody today.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
You must have a room
or a certain hour a day

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
or so where you do not know
what was in the newspapers

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that morning.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who
your friends are.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you owe to anybody.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
anybody owes to you.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But a place where you can simply
experience and bring forth what

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.890 align:middle line:90%
you are and what you might be.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the place of
creative incubation.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And first, you might find that
nothing's happening there.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a sacred place
and use it and take advantage

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:90%
of it, something will happen.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
>> This place does for
you what the plains did

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:90%
for the hunters--

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> For them, the whole
thing was a sacred place.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But most of our
action is economically

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
or socially determined and
does not come out of our life.

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether you've
had the experience I've had,

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but as you get older, the claims
of the environment upon you

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
are so great that you hardly
know where the hell you are.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.920 align:middle line:90%
What is it you intended?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You're always doing something
that is required of you.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
This minute, that
minute, another minute.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Where is your bliss station?

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.890 align:middle line:90%
To find it.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Get a phonograph and put
on the records, the music

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:90%
that you really love.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's corny music
that nobody else respects.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
The one that you like or
the book you want to read.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Get it done and have a
place in which to do it.

They get the now
feeling of life.

on mythology.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
This plain clearly bounded
by a circular horizon,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:84%
with that great blue dome
of an exalting heaven above.

And I can see the effect on
people's stories of that.

of being a pygmy
out of the forest.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
He brings this pygmy, who had
never been out of the jungle,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
onto a mountain top.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they
come over hill

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and there's an extensive
plain out there.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And the poor little fellow
was utterly terrified.

Had no way of judging
perspective and distance.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:84%
He thought that the animals
grazing on the plain out there

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
was so small that
they were ants.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
That they were just across
the way and so forth.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just totally baffled and
he rushes back into the forest.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
You have a different
mythology there.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.799 align:middle line:84%

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Where you and I would
be, perhaps, ill at ease.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Thinking what's behind that
tree and all this kind of thing.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
The sense of the beautiful
simple delight in there--

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.780 align:middle line:90%
the forest.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And the deity is the
master of the forest--

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:57.425 align:middle line:90%
the forest master.

00:08:57.425 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And what impresses me
is that these people--

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
the hunters and the
searchers for the roots

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and for the berries--

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
they're participating
in their landscape.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:90%
They are part of that world.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And it becomes
sacred to them.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Place becomes sacred.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Every feature of it does.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.133 align:middle line:84%
>> We, moderns, are stripping
the world of its natural

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:90%
revelations of nature.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I think of--

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
you remember that
wonderful pygmy legend

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
of the little boy who finds the
bird of the most beautiful song

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:90%
in the forest?

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And he brings it home.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't he?

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And he asked his
father to bring food

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:84%
for the bird and
the father doesn't

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:90%
want to feed only a bird.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And one time, the
father kills the bird.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And when he killed the
bird, he killed his own life

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.300 align:middle line:90%
and he died.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.685 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:56.485 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:09:56.485 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And the legend says
the man killed the bird.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And with the bird,
he killed the song.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:90%
And with the song, himself.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a story
about what happens

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
when human beings destroy
their environment,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
destroy their world,
destroy nature,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and the revelations of nature?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Destroy their own nature.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Human nature, too.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.895 align:middle line:90%
They killed the song.

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> They killed the song.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And isn't mythology
the story of the song?

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Mythology is the song.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.775 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the flight of the
imagination, inspired

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
by the energies of the
body and in its life.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened as human
beings turned from the hunting

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:84%
of animals to the
planting of seeds?

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
mythic imagination?

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I try to
think of it this way.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
An animal, as I think
I've said before,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:90%
is sort of a total entity.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you kill that
animal, that animal is dead.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But when you cut down a
plant, new sprouts come out.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Pruning is helpful to a plant.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Also in forests, where a good
deal of the origination of myth

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:84%
is to be recognized,
out of rock comes life.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Even in these forests here,
the beautiful Redwoods.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%
I was in wonderful forest
right near Mendocino

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and there, there are
some great, great stumps

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
from enormous trees
that were cut down

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:90%
some decades and decades ago.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And out of them are coming
these bright new little children

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:90%
who are part of the same plant.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's a sense of death
as not death, somehow.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
That death is required for
new fresh life and so on.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And the individual isn't
quite an individual.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:90%
He is a member of a plant.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Jesus uses the term, where
he says, I am the vine

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and you are the branches.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.310 align:middle line:84%
That vineyard idea is
a totally different one

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.297 align:middle line:84%
for the separate
entity of the animal.

00:12:07.297 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And this makes a difference
on the stories you tell--

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the whole feeling
about what life is.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What stories did this
experience of the plant give

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:90%
rise to you?

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Your favorite stories
in plant mythology.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the cutting up
and burial and then growing

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.070 align:middle line:90%
of the plant world.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
The world of the
plant that you eat,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:84%
being already a
cut up dead body,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
is the dominant motif I would
say in most of the tales.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It occurs all over the place,
particularly in the Pacific

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:90%
cultures and in the Americas.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me that story of the
origin of maize as Longfellow

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:90%
barred it from the Chippewas.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Didn't he?

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Or the Algonquins.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's an
Algonquin story.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:90%
And it is simply of the boy.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:84%
In his vision, he
sees a young man

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
come to him with plumes on his
head and green and so forth.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And the visitant and invites the
young man to a wrestling match.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And allows him to win.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And wins and wins.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
This happens three
or four times.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
But he tells him,
the last time I come,

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
you must kill me and bury me
and take care of the place

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:90%
where you will have buried me.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And the boy then,
in the last one,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
actually does what he
has been told to do.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Plants the man, the visitant.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And in time, comes back
and sees the corn growing.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was a boy who had been
of concern for his father, who

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:90%
was a hunter, but old.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was thinking,
isn't there some other way

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
to get food besides this one?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it came to him
out of his intentions.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:90%
A lovely story.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Some other way of
getting food than hunting.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> But the idea is
that this visitor,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
this figure in the vision has
to die and be buried before

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
the plant can grow from
the remains of his body.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the main theme.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
It comes up, I mean,
almost the duplicate

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of this one throughout
Polynesia, for instance.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's one in
Polynesia about the legend

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.220 align:middle line:90%
of the maiden Hina.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.420 align:middle line:90%
You remember that one?

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all of the legends
in the Polynesian area have

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:90%
a maiden named Hina.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And she's associated
with the moon.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And the death and
resurrection of the moon

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:90%
is a dominant theme.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens to
her in this legend?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the girl who loves
to bathe in a certain pool

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and there's a great eel that
is swimming around in the pool.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:51.095 align:middle line:84%
And day after day, he
scrapes across her thigh

00:14:51.095 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:90%
as she's bathing.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And then one fine, lovely
day, he turns into a young man

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and he becomes her
lover for a moment.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And then goes away and comes
back, again, and back, again.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And then one time when he comes
he says, just as the Algonquin

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.210 align:middle line:84%
visitant, now next time I come
to visit you, you must kill me.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And I cut off my head
and bury my head.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And she does so.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And that grows from the
buried head, a coconut tree.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you picked coconut
and looked at the coconut,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
you can see it's just
the size of the head.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can see eyes and
things in the little nodules

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.740 align:middle line:90%
that simulate the head.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you have is the same
story springing up in cultures

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:90%
unrelated to each other.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:90%
What is it saying?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to such an
extent that it's stunning.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And after years and years and
years of reading these things,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm still overwhelmed
at the similarities

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
in cultures that
are far, far apart.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
There are two
explanations of this.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
One explanation is that the
human psyche is essentially,

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:90%
the same all over the world.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It is the inward aspect
of the human body

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially, the
same all over the world.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
With the same organs,
with the same instincts,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
with the same impulse systems,
with the same conflicts,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:90%
the same fears.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
There is also the counter
theory of diffusion.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, for instance, when
agriculture is first developed,

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in the Near East
or in Southeast Asia-- these

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
are the two big centers
in the old world.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Then the art of tilling the
soil goes forth from this area.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And along with it,
goes the mythology

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with
fertilizing the Earth

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:90%
and bringing up the plants.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Killing the body.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Cutting it up, then burying
it and having the plant come.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
That myth will go with the
agricultural tradition.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You won't find it in a
hunting culture tradition.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So that there are historical,
as well as psychological aspects

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
to this problem.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> In all of these stories,
there is someone dying--

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:90%
a hero dying--

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
in order for life
to appear, again.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:90%
What does that say to you?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me tell you
one story here.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:90%
This isn't a story.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:90%
This is a ritual.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:90%
It's in New Guinea.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's associated with the
men's societies in New Guinea

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:90%
and they are horror societies.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they really enact the
myth of death and resurrection

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:90%
and cannibalistic consumption.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have the myth there of
the buried body and the life

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:90%
coming out of it.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:90%
You know this as the basic myth.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:34.117 align:middle line:90%
Now we're going to enact it.

00:17:34.117 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:90%
So here's the sacred fields.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
The drums going and chants
going and then pauses.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And this went on for three or
four or five days on and on.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And rituals are boring.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.455 align:middle line:90%
They just wear you out.

00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you break
through to something else.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Then comes the great moment.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The young boys who are
being initiated into manhood

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
were now to have their
first sexual experience.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a great shed of
enormous logs supported

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:90%
by two uprights over here.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And the young woman comes in
all ornamented as a deity.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And she is brought to
lie down in this place

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:90%
beneath the great roof.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And the boys then, with the
drums going and chanting

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:90%
going on, one after another--

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:90%
there are about six boys--

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:84%
have their first
permitted or public

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:90%
intercourse with the girl.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And when the last boy is
with her, in full embrace,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:90%
the supports are withdrawn.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:84%
The logs drop and the
couple are killed.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
There is the union
of male and female,

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
again, as they were
in the beginning

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
before the separation
took place.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
There is the union of a
beginning and death, again.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:90%
And they're both the same thing.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The little pair are
pulled out and roasted

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.060 align:middle line:90%
and eaten right that evening.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Enacting the myth in
its essential character.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Can't beat that.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And the truth to--

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the
sacrifice of the mass.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
One of the wonderful things
in the Catholic ritual

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.946 align:middle line:90%
is going to communion.

00:19:31.946 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
There you're taught
that this is the body

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:90%
and blood of the Savior.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And you take it to you
and you turn inward.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And there, he's
working within you.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The truth to which
the ritual point is--

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The nature of life itself
to be realized in the acts

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
When in the hunting cultures
a sacrifice is made,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
it is, as it were, a gift, a
bribe, as it were, to the deity

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that is being invited
to do something for us

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:90%
or to give us something.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
When a figure is sacrificed
in the plating culture,

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:90%
that figure is the God.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
The person who died, was
buried, and became the food

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
is Christ crucified from whose
body the food of the spirit

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:27.530 align:middle line:90%
comes.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a sublimation
of what originally

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.390 align:middle line:90%
was a very solid vegetal image.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:84%
He is on the Holy
Rood-- the tree.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
He is himself, the
fruit of the tree.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is the fruit
of eternal life,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:84%
which was on the second
tree in the Garden of Eden.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
When man had eaten of the fruit
of the first tree, the Tree

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:84%
of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil,

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
he was said to have been
expelled from the garden.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
He had already expelled
himself from the garden.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The garden is the place
of unity, non-duality.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Non-duality of male and female.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Non-duality of man and God.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Non-duality of good and evil.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.080 align:middle line:84%
You eat the duality and
you're on the way out.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So this tree of the non-duality
is the tree of the exit.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Now the tree of coming
back to the garden

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:90%
is the Tree of Immortal Life.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Where you know that I
and the Father are one.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And the two that seem
to become one, again.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly the tree
under which the Buddha sits.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The Tree of Wisdom.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The Tree of Immortal Life, of
the Knowledge of Immortal Life.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha under his tree
and Christ hanging on his tree

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:90%
are the same image.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:90%
They are the same image.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:84%
The one who has
died to the flesh

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:90%
and been reborn in the spirit.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
This is an essential experience
of any mystical realization.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
You die to your flesh and
are born to your spirit.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
You identify yourself with
the consciousness and life,

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
of which your body
is, but the vehicle.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.670 align:middle line:84%
You guide to the vehicle
and become identified

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
in your consciousness with
that of which the vehicle is

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:90%
the carrier.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand me?

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And that is the God.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So that what you get in
the vegetation traditions

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
is this notion of identity
behind the surface

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
display of duality.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.685 align:middle line:90%
Identity behind it all.

00:22:27.685 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
All of these are
manifestations of the one.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The one radiance shines
through all things.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
The function of
art, in a way, is

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to reveal through the
object here, the radiance.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
get when you see

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful organization
of a fortunately composed

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:90%
work of art.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.430 align:middle line:90%
You just say aha.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Somehow it speaks to the
order in your own life.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a realization
through art of the very thing

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:84%
that the religions are
concerned to render.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That death is life and life
is death and that the two are

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:90%
in accord.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to have a balance
between death and life.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
They are two aspects of the
same thing, which is being,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.277 align:middle line:90%
becoming.

00:23:10.277 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's in all
of these stories.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>> All of them.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.985 align:middle line:84%
I don't know one where
death is rejected.

00:23:16.985 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> This idea of sacrifice is
so foreign to our world today.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the old idea of being
sacrificed is not what we think

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Just consider, I think the
great model of sacrifice

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
is the Mayan Indian Ballgame.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
They had a kind of
basketball game.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a loop there,
up in the stadium wall.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.207 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to get this
big heavy ball through that.

00:23:52.207 --> 00:23:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how they did
it with their shoulders,

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.748 align:middle line:84%
their heads, or
something or other.

00:23:55.748 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And the captain of
the winning team

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:84%
was sacrificed on the field by
the captain of the losing team.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:90%
His head was cut off.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And going to your sacrifice as
the winning stroke of your life

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.580 align:middle line:84%
is the essence of the
early sacrificial idea.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful story that I
found in the Jesuit relations--

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Jesuits
here in the 17th century

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:84%
as missionaries up in Canada
and northern New York State

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:90%
and so forth--

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
of a young Iroquois
boy who had just

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:84%
been captured by the
Hurons, or perhaps

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:35.810 align:middle line:90%
it was the other way around.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was being brought
to be tortured to death.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
The Northeast Indians engaged
in a systematic torture, which

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:90%
would go on for a long time.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And the ordeal was to be
sustained with a smile

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.730 align:middle line:90%
without flinching.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:90%
That was real manhood.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But the boy is brought
to this as though he were

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.680 align:middle line:90%
being brought to his wedding.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:90%
He is singing.

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And the people with
him are treating him

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
as though they were his hosts
and he was the honored guest.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And he played the
game with them,

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:90%
knowing where he was going.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And the priest
describing the thing

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely bewildered
by the situation.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And they say the mockery
of this kind of hospitality

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
for people who are then going
to become the brutes-- no.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Those people were the priests.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
sacrifice of the altar.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And that boy was
Jesus, by analogy.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And the priest, every
day is celebrating

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.810 align:middle line:84%
mass, which is an imitation
or repetition actually,

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:90%
of the sacrifice of the cross.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
priest was witnessing.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But then you have it also
in the Acts of John--

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Jesus before going to
crucified, the Jesus dance.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most
beautiful passages

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Christian tradition.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.250 align:middle line:84%
In the Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John gospels,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly
mentioned that we sang

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.200 align:middle line:90%
a hymn and Jesus went forth.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, here you have the whole
hymn described in a ring.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Jesus in the center
saying join hands.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll sing and we'll dance.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I am this.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.220 align:middle line:90%
I am that.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.310 align:middle line:90%
I am so forth, so forth.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, it's grand.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And then he walks
out to be crucified.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
When you go to your
death that way as a God,

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
you are going to
your eternal life.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:90%
What's sad about that?

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's make it great.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.010 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The god of death is
the lord of the dance.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The god of death is the
lord of sex at the same time.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean?

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a marvelous thing.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.960 align:middle line:84%
One after another, you can
see these god's gay day.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The death god of the Haitian,
Vodou, is also the sex god,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Wotan had one eye covered
and the other uncovered.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time
was the lord of life.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, the lord of
death and the lord

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:90%
of the generation of life.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a basic theme.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
That which dies is born.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to have death
in order to have life.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the origin thought
really, of the headhunt.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
In Southeast Asia
and particularly

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:84%
in the Indonesian
zone, the headhunt--

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:90%
right up to now--

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:90%
has been a sacred act.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred killing.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Unless there is death,
there cannot be birth.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And a young man, before
he can be permitted

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:84%
to marry and become a
father, must have gone forth

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and had his kill.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that say to you?

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that every generation
has to die in order that

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.070 align:middle line:90%
the next generation should come.

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you begin or
give birth to a child,

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:90%
you're the dead one.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
The child is the new
life and you are simply

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.047 align:middle line:90%
the protector of that new life.

00:27:53.047 --> 00:27:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Your time has
come and you know it.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's why there
is this deep psychological

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.302 align:middle line:84%
association of
begetting and dying.

00:28:00.302 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't there some relationship
between what you're saying

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and this fact that a father
will give his life for his son,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
a mother will give her
life for her child?

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a wonderful paper--

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether you
knew that I would love

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:90%
to have talked to this point.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
paper by Schopenhauer,

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:84%
who's one of my three
favorite philosophers,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
called The Foundation
of Morality.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:84%
There, he asked exactly the
question that you've asked.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:84%
How is it that a
human being can so

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
participate in the
peril or pain of another

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that without thought,
spontaneously he

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:84%
sacrifices his own
life to the other.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
How can this happen,
that what we normally

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
think of as the
first law of nature--

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:84%
namely self-preservation--
is suddenly dissolved

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and there's a breakthrough?

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:84%
In Hawaii, some four
or five years ago,

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
there was an
extraordinary adventure

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:90%
that represents this problem.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a place there
called the Pali, where

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.240 align:middle line:84%
the trade winds
from the North come

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:09.030 align:middle line:84%
breaking through a
great ridge of rocks--

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.410 align:middle line:84%
of mountain-- and they come
through with a great blast

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:90%
of wind.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And people like to go up
there to get their hair blown

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.360 align:middle line:90%
around and so forth.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Or to commit suicide, like
jumping off the Golden Gate

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Bridge.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, a police
car was on its way

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:84%
up the early little road
that used to go up there.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And they saw just beyond
the railing that keeps cars

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.490 align:middle line:84%
from rolling over, a
young man actually,

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
clearly about to jump and
prepare himself to jump.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:90%
The police car stopped.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The policeman on the right
jumps out to grab the boy

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and grabs him just as he
jumped and was himself

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.210 align:middle line:90%
being pulled over.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And would have gone over
if the second cop hadn't

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.610 align:middle line:84%
gotten around, grabbed him, and
pulled the two of them back.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a long
description of this.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a marvelous thing in
the newspapers at that time.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And the policeman was asked,
why didn't you let go?

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.907 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you would
have lost your life.

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And you see what
happened to that man.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:84%
This is what's known as
one-pointed meditation.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything else in
his life dropped off.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:15.090 align:middle line:90%
His duty to his family.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.740 align:middle line:90%
His duty to his job.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:90%
His duty to his own career.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.910 align:middle line:84%
All of his wishes
and hopes for life

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:84%
just disappeared and
he was about to go.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And his answer was
I couldn't let go.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.060 align:middle line:84%
If I had-- and I'm quoting
almost word for word-

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
if I had let that
young man go, I

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:84%
could not have lived
another day of my life.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.710 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Schopenhauer's
answer is, this is

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:84%
the breakthrough of a
metaphysical realization

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%
that you and the other are one.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And that the
separateness is only

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:84%
an effect of the temporal
forms of sensibility

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:90%
of time and space.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And our true reality is in
that unity with all life.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:84%
It is a metaphysical truth that
becomes spontaneously realized

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's the real
truth of your life.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might say the
hero is the one who

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:84%
has given his physical
life, you might say,

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:84%
to some order of
realization of that truth.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It may appear that
I'm one with my tribe

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:84%
or I'm one with the
people of a certain kind

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:90%
or I'm one with life.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:90%
This is not a concept.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:90%
This is a realization.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Explain it.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And the concept of love your
neighbor and all ought to put

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.770 align:middle line:90%
you in tune with that fact.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But whether you love
your neighbor or not--

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:90%
bing.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:84%
The thing grabs you
and you do this thing.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.300 align:middle line:90%
You don't even know who it is.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.610 align:middle line:84%
That policeman didn't know
who that young man was.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And Schopenhauer
says in small ways,

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:02.410 align:middle line:84%
you can see this happening
every day all the time.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a theme that can be
seen moving life in the world.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
People doing nice
things for each other.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think has
happened to this mythic idea--

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:90%
the hero in our culture today?

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It comes up in an
experience, I think.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I remember during
the Vietnam War,

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:27.150 align:middle line:84%
seeing on the television, the
young men in helicopters going

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:84%
out to rescue one of their
companions at great risk

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.640 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.190 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have to
rescue that young man.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the same thing working.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:41.490 align:middle line:84%
It puts them in touch with
the experience of being alive.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Going to the office every day,
you don't get that experience.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, you're
ripped into being alive.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And life is pain and life is
suffering and life is horror.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:90%
But, by God, you're alive.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's spectacular.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is a case
of being alive--

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.340 align:middle line:90%
rescuing that young man.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But I also know
a man who said once,

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:84%
after years of standing on
the platform of the subway,

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I die a little bit
down there every day,

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
but I know I'm doing
so for my family.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
There are small
acts of heroism--

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>> That occur without regard to
the nobility or the notoriety

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.090 align:middle line:90%
that you attract for it.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And the mother does it by the
isolation she endures in behalf

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:90%
of the family of--

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Motherhood is a sacrifice.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:31.620 align:middle line:84%
On our veranda in Hawaii,
there are little birds

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.260 align:middle line:90%
that Jean likes to feed.

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And each year, there have
been one or two mother birds.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever seen a mother
bird plagued by her progeny

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.890 align:middle line:84%
for food-- that the mother
should regurgitate their meal

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:90%
to them--

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and two of them--
or five of them,

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:84%
in one case-- flopping all
over this poor little mother.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:84%
They bigger than
she, in some cases.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
You just think, well, this
is the symbol of motherhood.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
This is just giving of your
substance and everything

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:90%
to this progeny.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:90%
This should be it in marriage.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:90%
A marriage is a relationship.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:12.900 align:middle line:84%
When you make a
sacrifice in marriage,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
you're not sacrificing
to the other.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.239 align:middle line:84%
You're sacrificing
to the relationship.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is symbolized,
for example,

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:84%
in that Chinese
image of the tai chi.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:27.090 align:middle line:84%
The tao with the dark and
the light interacting.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:90%
It's a well-known sign.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:32.010 align:middle line:84%
That is the relationship
of yang and yin--

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:90%
male and female.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:90%
Which is what a marriage is.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you are.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.170 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer this.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.820 align:middle line:90%
You're the relationship.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so marriage, I would
say, is not a love affair.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an ordeal.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.840 align:middle line:90%
>> An ordeal?

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The ordeal is sacrifice
of ego to the relationship

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.170 align:middle line:84%
of a twoness, which
now becomes the one.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.695 align:middle line:84%
>> One not only biologically,
but spiritually.

00:34:55.695 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And primarily, spiritually.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It's primarily spiritually.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But the necessary function
of marriage in order to create

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:09.280 align:middle line:84%
our own images and perpetuate
ourselves in children,

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.047 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the
primary one, as you say.

00:35:11.047 --> 00:35:11.847 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:35:11.847 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:84%
That's really, just the
elementary aspect of marriage.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.370 align:middle line:84%
There are two completely
different stages of marriage.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:25.470 align:middle line:84%
First is the youthful marriage,
following the wonderful impulse

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that nature has given us in
the interplay of the sexes

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.470 align:middle line:90%
biologically.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the
reproduction of children.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But there comes a time when the
child graduates from the family

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and the family is left.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I've been amazed at the
number of my friends

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.850 align:middle line:84%
who are in their
40s or 50s go apart.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Who have had a perfectly decent
life together with the child,

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
but they interpreted their
union in terms of relationship

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:55.830 align:middle line:90%
through the child.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:84%
They did not
interpret it in terms

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:84%
of their own personal
relationship to each other.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Utterly incompatible with the
idea of doing one's own thing.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not one's
own thing, you see.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It is, in the sense,
one's own thing.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But the one isn't just
you, it's the two together.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's a purely
mythological image.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Of the sacrifice of the visible
entity for a transcendent unit.

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Cracking eggs to make an omelet.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And by the right
person, we reconstruct

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.780 align:middle line:90%
the image of the incarnate God.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's what marriage is.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> The right person.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:44.160 align:middle line:84%
How does one choose
the right person?

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Your heart tells you.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.820 align:middle line:90%
It ought to.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Your inner being.

00:36:46.653 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the mystery.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> You recognize
your other self.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I don't know.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But there's a flash that comes
and something in your nose

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.410 align:middle line:90%
that this is the one.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What has mythology
told you about death?

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.730 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about death?

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the way, if one can
identify with the consciousness

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:84%
of which the body is a
vehicle and really achieve

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:17.050 align:middle line:84%
an identification with the
consciousness of which the body

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:18.850 align:middle line:84%
is a vehicle, not
knowing what it is--

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:90%
undifferentiated consciousness--

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:90%
one can let the body go.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I like what I heard
of Woody Allen.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:90%
"I'm not afraid to die.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want to be
there when it happens."

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:84%
You can have disengaged yourself
from the body and not be there,

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.630 align:middle line:90%
you might say.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, you know from myth
and nature that the body dies.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:90%
It perishes.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:43.690 align:middle line:90%
It rots.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
We're back to the
beginning of the--

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So you expect it.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Growing old, you know
what's happening.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:90%
The body is rotting.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:90%
It's dying.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:55.960 align:middle line:90%
It's losing its energy.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:84%
There's more mass
than energy here.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And the identification then
with the life, which in a plant

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.750 align:middle line:84%
survives pruning,
cutting, and even eating,

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:12.100 align:middle line:84%
the plant is right back there,
again, is, you might say,

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
a biological image
that is metaphorical

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.950 align:middle line:90%
of this spiritual mystery.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a wonderful
report of the Indians riding

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.210 align:middle line:84%
into the rain of bullets
from Custer's men.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
it's a good day to die.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great day to die.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.420 align:middle line:90%
They're not hanging on.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the message of the myth.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.630 align:middle line:84%
You, as you know
yourself, are not

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:45.010 align:middle line:90%
the final term of your being.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you must die to
that, one way or another.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.240 align:middle line:84%
In giving of yourself
to something or in being

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.190 align:middle line:84%
annihilated, actually,
physically to return,

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:90%
you might say, or to recognize .

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Life is always on
the edge of death.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And one should lack fear and
have the courage of life.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the principle
the initiation

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.390 align:middle line:90%
of all of the heroic stories.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the central story?

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you have a story
that's central to this?

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Sir Gawain
and the Green Knight."

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The Green Knight of his
court is in session.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:10%
And there rides into the court
on a great big green horse,

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.470 align:middle line:10%
a giant knight.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And the knight says,
I have a challenge.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I have an adventure.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.460 align:middle line:84%
I challenge anyone
here to come down

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.190 align:middle line:84%
here and take this great
big ax and cut my head off.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And then one year from today,
meet me at a green chapel--

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and he'd tell them roughly
where the green chapel is--

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'll cut his head off.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And the only knight
who had the courage

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to accept this curious
invitation was Gawain.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And the knight
gets off his horse.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Sticks out his neck.

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Gawain comes down with his
ax and there's the head.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the knight stands
up, picks up the head,

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
gets on the horse,
and rides off.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Says I'll see you in a year.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Well that year, everybody
was very generous to Gawain

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.670 align:middle line:90%
and he rides off for the year.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:84%
As the day approaches,
he finds himself

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.780 align:middle line:90%
before a little hunter's cabin.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks he'll
ask advice here as

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.160 align:middle line:90%
to where the green chapel is.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And tells them I've got
to be there in three days.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And the hunter greets him
and Gawain tells his story.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And the hunter says,
well, the green chapel,

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.230 align:middle line:90%
he's just down the way here.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
He says it's about
a couple yards.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And why don't you just
spend the next three days

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.370 align:middle line:84%
with us and we'll
entertain you and then you

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.000 align:middle line:90%
go to this adventure.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Very well.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So the hunter says,
well, I've got to go out

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:90%
for the day on the hunt.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And he says you'll
spend the night with us.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
morning, I'll go forth.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the evening,
I'll come back

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give everything I would
have got during the day to you

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and you give to me what you
would have got during the day.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, the hunter
rides off and Gawain's in bed.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And in comes to the hunter's
gorgeous, beautiful wife.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And she tickles Gawain's
chin and invites him to love.

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's an Arthurian knight--

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:90%
a night of Arthur's court.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And to betray his
host is the last thing

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:90%
that a knight can submit to.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.990 align:middle line:90%
So he resists this woman.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:90%
And she's very, very aggressive.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And he's very, very
stern in his position.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And finally she says, well,
let me give you a kiss, anyhow.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So she gives him one big
smack and that's that.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:55.270 align:middle line:84%
In the evening, the hunter comes
back with a great hall of game.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Throws it on the floor and
Gawain gives him a kiss.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And they laugh and that's that.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Second morning, a similar event.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The wife comes in and
Gawain gets two kisses.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And the hunter comes back
with about half as much game

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:90%
and he gets two kisses.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.550 align:middle line:90%
They laugh and that's that.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.920 align:middle line:84%
The third morning, the
wife comes in-- now here's

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.140 align:middle line:90%
a man about to meet his death.

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:19.570 align:middle line:84%
He's about to have
his head chopped off.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful woman.

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The last moment
of the possibility

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:90%
of this wonderful fulfillment.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And, again, he resists.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:84%
She gives him three
kisses and her daughter.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And she says, this will
protect you against any danger.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
The hunter comes home with
just one silly smelly fox.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Throws it on the
ground and he gets

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.540 align:middle line:90%
three kisses, but no daughter.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So comes the time now to go
and have your head chopped off.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you see what the tests
are of the night here?

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.100 align:middle line:90%
One is sex, lust.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.400 align:middle line:90%
And the other is courage.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So he approaches
the green chapel

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.260 align:middle line:84%
with the green knight whom
he's about to encounter.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And he hears the knight
whetting this great knife--

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.145 align:middle line:90%
this great ax.

00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He comes to it and the
knight is there, certainly--

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.260 align:middle line:90%
the great big green fellow.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.520 align:middle line:90%
And he greets him.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And said, OK.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Put your leg down
there on this block

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'll chop your head off.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And he lifts the
ax And he says no.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Stretch out a little more.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:90%
He does this three times.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the ax comes
down and just cuts

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:90%
his neck a little bit.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.550 align:middle line:84%
The green knight says
that's the daughter.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the origin
legend of the knights of god.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So here's the knight who
really transcended the two

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.100 align:middle line:90%
great temptations--

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:84%
fear of death and lust for
sex and the joys of life.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And the moral?

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And moral is that the
realization of your bliss,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.960 align:middle line:84%
your true being comes when you
have put aside the, what might

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.930 align:middle line:84%
be called, a passing moment
with its terror and with its

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:20.870 align:middle line:84%
temptations and its statement
of requirements of life that you

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:middle line:90%
should live this way.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that story about--

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and I forget where it comes
from-- about the camel and then

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.060 align:middle line:90%
the lion.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, you
lose the burden of youth.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The three transformations
of the spirit.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.240 align:middle line:90%
That's Nietzsche.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.900 align:middle line:84%
That's the prologue to
Thus Spake Zarathustra.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me that story.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are a child, when
you are young and a young

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.090 align:middle line:90%
person, you are a camel.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:54.580 align:middle line:84%
The camel gets down on its
knees and says put a load on me.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.750 align:middle line:90%
This is obedience.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.640 align:middle line:84%
This is receiving the
instruction and information

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.540 align:middle line:84%
that your society knows
you must have in order

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:90%
to live a competent life.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.290 align:middle line:84%
When the camel is well loaded,
he gets up on his feet--

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:84%
struggles to his feet and
runs out into the desert,

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:18.520 align:middle line:84%
where he becomes
transformed into a lion.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The heavier the load, the
more powerful the lion.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The function of the lion
is to kill a dragon.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And the name of
the dragon is thou

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.130 align:middle line:84%
shalt. And on every
scale of the dragon,

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:37.800 align:middle line:90%
there is a thou shalt imprinted.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Some of it comes from 2,000
years, 4,000 years ago.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Some of it comes from yesterday
morning's newspaper headline.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.310 align:middle line:84%
When the dragon is
killed, the lion

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.070 align:middle line:90%
is transformed into a child.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:58.280 align:middle line:84%
An innocent child living
out of its own dynamic.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And Nietzsche uses the
term [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:06.100 align:middle line:84%
A wheel rolling out
of its own center.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what you become.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:10.580 align:middle line:90%
That is the mature individual.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The thou shalt is
the civilizing force.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It turns a human animal into
a civilized human being.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But then the one who is
thrown off the thou shalt

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is still a civilized
human being.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.710 align:middle line:84%
You see, he has been
humanized, you might say,

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.510 align:middle line:90%
by the thou shalt system.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So his performance
now as a child

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:90%
is not simply childlike at all.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.030 align:middle line:84%
He has assimilated the
culture and thrown it off

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:36.500 align:middle line:90%
as a thou shout.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
way in any artwork,

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.790 align:middle line:90%
you go to work and study an art.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.200 align:middle line:90%
You study the techniques.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.890 align:middle line:90%
You study all the rules.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And the rules are put
upon you by a teacher.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Then there comes a time
of using the rules.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Not being used by them.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You're--

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> One way is to follow--

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I always tell my students,
follow your bliss.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Follow your bliss?

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Your bliss.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Where the deep sense
of being inform.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And going where your
body and soul want to go.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:84%
When you have that
feeling, then stay with it

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and don't let anyone
throw you off.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever read
Sinclair Lewis' "Babbitt?"

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Not in a long time.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember
the last line?

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I've never done the thing
I wanted to in all my life.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite an--

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the man who
never followed his bliss.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, I heard that line.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.458 align:middle line:84%
I was living in
Bronxville when I

00:47:31.458 --> 00:47:32.750 align:middle line:90%
was teaching at Sarah Lawrence.

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Before I was married,
I used to be eating out

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:41.660 align:middle line:84%
in the restaurants of the
town for my lunch and dinners.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And Thursday night was the
maid's night off in Bronxville

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:84%
so that all the families
were out in the restaurants.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And one fine evening, I was in
my favorite restaurant there.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:53.900 align:middle line:90%
It was a Greek restaurant.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And at the table was
sitting a father, a mother,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and a scrawny little
boy about 12 years old.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:09.245 align:middle line:84%
The father says to the boy,
drink your tomato juice.

00:48:09.245 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And the boy says,
I don't want to.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And the father,
with a louder voice,

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.190 align:middle line:90%
says drink your tomato juice.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And the mother
says, don't make him

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:23.780 align:middle line:90%
do what he doesn't want to do.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.820 align:middle line:84%
The father looks
at her and he says,

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:30.000 align:middle line:84%
he can't go through life
doing what he wants to do.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.280 align:middle line:84%
He said if he does only what
he wants to do, he'll be dead.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I've never done the thing
I wanted to in all my life.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.230 align:middle line:90%
I said my God.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.540 align:middle line:90%
"Babbitt" incarnate.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the man who
never followed his bliss.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, you may have
a success in life,

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:90%
but then just think of it.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:90%
What kind of life was it?

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.220 align:middle line:90%
What good is it?

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.018 align:middle line:84%
You've never done anything you
wanted to in all your life.

00:48:58.018 --> 00:48:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens when
you follow your bliss?

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You come to bliss.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.790 align:middle line:90%
This should be it in marriage.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:08.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the sense
of the marriage ceremony.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:12.980 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle Ages,
a favorite image

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:84%
that occurs in
many, many contexts

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:90%
is the wheel of fortune.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There's the hub of
the wheel and there's

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.230 align:middle line:90%
the revolving rim of the wheel.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you are attached
to the rim of the wheel,

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.980 align:middle line:90%
that's a fortune.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.220 align:middle line:84%
You will be either above,
going down at the bottom,

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.430 align:middle line:90%
or coming up.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you are at the hub,
you're in the same place

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.660 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's the sense
of the marriage vow.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I take you in health or
sickness and wealth or poverty.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.900 align:middle line:84%
But I take you and
you are my bliss.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Not the wealth that
you might bring

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.390 align:middle line:84%
me, nor the social
prestige, but you.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's following your bliss.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I came to this idea of
bliss because in Sanskrit--

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.470 align:middle line:84%
which is the great spiritual
language of the world.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And they know all about
it and have known about it

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:09.690 align:middle line:90%
for a long time--

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:84%
the transcendent
is transcendent.

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But there are three terms
that bring you to the brink,

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:19.130 align:middle line:84%
you might say, of the jumping
off place to the ocean.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And the three terms
are [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:24.560 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.410 align:middle line:84%
The word [NON-ENGLISH]
means being,

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:30.800 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] means
full consciousness,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and [NON-ENGLISH] means rapture.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I don't know
whether my consciousness

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.740 align:middle line:90%
is full consciousness or not.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether my being
is the proper being or not.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But I do know where
my rapture is.

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So let me hang onto
rapture and that

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.500 align:middle line:84%
would bring me both being
and full consciousness.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What was your rapture?

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it started
with Indians.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And then it went on into more
and more mythological matters

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and the realm of
the arts, music.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I met Jean,
then the dance came in.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And this is it.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.400 align:middle line:90%
Just stay with that.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And one doesn't have
to be a poet to do this.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Carpenters do it.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> A poet is--

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Farmers do it.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Simply one who's made a
profession and a lifestyle

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of being in touch with that.

00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Most people have to be
concerned with other things.

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:37.610 align:middle line:84%
They get themselves involved in
economic and other activities.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Or you're drafted
into a war that isn't

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.350 align:middle line:90%
the one you're interested in.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And how to hold
to this umbilical,

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.070 align:middle line:84%
you might say, in
those circumstances.

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.140 align:middle line:84%
That's a technique each
one has to work out

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.970 align:middle line:90%
for himself somehow.

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But most people
living in that realm

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:03.350 align:middle line:84%
of what might be called
our occasional concerns,

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.240 align:middle line:84%
they all have the
capacity that's

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.610 align:middle line:84%
waiting to be awakened to
move to this other place.

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:09.410 align:middle line:90%
I know it.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:12.650 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happen in students.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:16.790 align:middle line:84%
A wonderful way of teaching
we had at Sarah Lawrence,

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.800 align:middle line:84%
where I taught for 38 years, I'd
have an individual conference

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:84%
with every one of
my students at least

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.810 align:middle line:84%
once a fortnight for
half an hour or so.

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And there, you're talking
on about the things

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that students ought
to be reading.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you
hit on something

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that the student
really responds to.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:37.820 align:middle line:90%
You can see the eyes open.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.320 align:middle line:90%
The complexion changes.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.320 align:middle line:84%
A life possibility
has opened there.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And all you can
say to yourself is

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I hope this child
hangs onto that.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.980 align:middle line:90%
They may or may not.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But when they do, they've
found a life right there

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:54.420 align:middle line:90%
in the room with you.

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you advise somebody
to tap that spring of eternal

00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:58.970 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.440 align:middle line:90%
that joy that is right there?

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're having
experiences all the time which

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.460 align:middle line:84%
may, on occasion, render
some sense of this.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.340 align:middle line:84%
A little intuition
of where your joy is.

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Grab it.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:84%
No one can tell you
what it's going to be.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.043 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've got to learn
to recognize your own depths.

00:53:17.043 --> 00:53:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever have this
sense when you're following

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:21.190 align:middle line:84%
your bliss, as I
have in moments,

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:24.670 align:middle line:90%
of being helped by hidden hands?

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:28.480 align:middle line:90%
It's miraculous.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I even have a
superstition that has

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:84%
grown on me as the
result of invisible hands

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:35.920 align:middle line:90%
coming all the time.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Namely, that if you
do follow your bliss,

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:40.420 align:middle line:84%
you put yourself
on a kind of track

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that has been there all
the while waiting for you.

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And the life that you
ought to be living

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is the one you're
living, somehow.

00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
see it, you begin

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to deal with people who are
in the field of your bliss.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And they open doors to you.

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I say follow your bliss
and don't be afraid.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And doors will open
where you didn't

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:04.660 align:middle line:90%
know they were going to be.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You ever have sympathy for
the man who has no invisible

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.276 align:middle line:90%
means of support?

00:54:10.276 --> 00:54:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no invisible mean.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:15.280 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that
evokes compassion--

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.270 align:middle line:90%
the poor chap.

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And to see him stumbling
around when there's water

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and what life is right there it
really, it evokes one's pity.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right there?

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:29.110 align:middle line:90%
Right there?

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:30.040 align:middle line:90%
You believe that?

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> The waters of eternal life.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right there.

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Where?

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Wherever you are.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:37.930 align:middle line:90%
If you're following your bliss.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:41.050 align:middle line:84%
you're having that
joy, that refreshment,

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.350 align:middle line:90%
that life all the time.
