>> Genesis 1--

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the Earth.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.000 align:middle line:84%
The Earth was without
form and void.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

Indians.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, there was only
darkness everywhere, darkness

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:90%
and water.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
In the darkness,
gathered thick in places,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
crowding together
and then separating,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
crowding and separating.

was moving over the face

of the waters.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And God said, let
there be light.

>> And this is from
the Hindu Upanishad.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, there was
only the great self reflected

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a person.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Reflecting, it found
nothing but itself.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.231 align:middle line:84%
And its first word
was, this, am I.

>> Why is it, Joseph
Campbell wondered,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.220 align:middle line:84%
that in almost every
culture on Earth,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.550 align:middle line:84%
you can find stories that
tell of virgins giving birth

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to heroes who died
and are resurrected?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis, Jesus
of Nazareth-- parallel stories

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
of suffering, sacrifice,
and redemption.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And why did certain sites take
on holy status, one religion

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:84%
following another on the very
same spot, believers coming

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
century after
century for healing

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
or for some other blessing
from their different gods?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids on the Nile,
the ziggurats of Mesopotamia,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:84%
the Aztec shrines,
the cathedrals

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
of Chartres and Notre
Dame, all pointing

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
beyond the visible
plane of existence.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Buried deep in our DNA, Campbell
concluded, no matter who we are

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is the need to
worship, to believe

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:90%
and the capacity for reverence.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Religion with its symbols,
and rituals, and stories

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is the way we mortals try to
connect to that unseen world.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Raised Roman Catholic,
Campbell's own life experiences

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
made him a maverick in
search of the sublime.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Over the last two summers of his
life and hours of conversations

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
recorded in the library of
Lucasfilm in California,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
we talked about how
mythology can still

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
awaken a sense of awe,
gratitude, and even rapture.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Why myths?

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Why should we care about myths?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
What do they have
to do with my life?

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my first answer would
be, well, John, live your life.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a good life.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't need this.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in being
interested in subjects,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
because they are said to be
important and interesting.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe in being caught
by it, somehow or other.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But you may find that with
the proper introduction,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%
this subject will catch you.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what can it do for
you when it does catch you?

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
These bits of information
from ancient times,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
which have to do with the themes
that have supported man's life,

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
built civilizations, informed
religions over the millennia,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
have to do with deep, inner
problems, inner mysteries,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:90%
inner thresholds of passage.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know what the
guide signs are along the way,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
you have to work
it out yourself.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But once this catches
you, there is always

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
such a feeling
from one or another

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
of these traditions
of information

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
of a deep, rich,
life-vivifying sort,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
that you want to give it up.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So myths are stories of the
search by men and women through

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
the ages for meaning,
for significance,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.170 align:middle line:84%
to make life signify,
to touch the eternal,

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
to understand the mysterious,
to find out who we are?

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> People say that what we
are all seeking is a meaning

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
for life.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's what
we're really seeking.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're seeking is
an experience of being alive so

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that the life experiences
that we have on the purely

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
physical plane will have
resonances within that

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:84%
are those of our own
innermost being and reality

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and so that we actually feel
the rapture of being alive.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's
all finally about.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's what these clues help
us to find within ourselves.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Myths are clues?

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Myths are clues to the
spiritual potentialities

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:90%
of the human life.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're capable
of knowing within?

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> And experiencing within?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I liked your--

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.565 align:middle line:84%
you changed the
definition of a myth

00:05:54.565 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:84%
from the search for meaning
to the experience of meaning.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Experience.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
Experience.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Experience of life.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The experience of life.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
The mind has to do
with meaning in here.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.670 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning of a flower?

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
That is the Zen story of
the sermon of the Buddha

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
when his whole
company was gathered.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And he simply lifted a flower.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's only
one man, Cassiopeia,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
who gave him a
sign with his eyes

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that he understood
what was said.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What's the meaning
of the universe?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning of a flea?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just there.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And your own meaning
is that you are there.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Then we are so engaged
in doing things

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
to achieve purposes
of outer value

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that we forget that the
inner value, the rapture that

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is associated with being
alive, is what it's all about.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, we want to think about God.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:90%
God is a thought.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
God is a name.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:90%
God is an idea.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But its reference
is to something

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that transcends all thinking.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate mystery
of being is beyond all

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:90%
categories of thought.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:84%
My friend, Heinrich
Zimmer, of years ago,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:84%
used to say the best
things can't be told,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
because they transcend thought.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
The second best
are misunderstood.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because those are
the thoughts that

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to refer to that
which can't be thought about.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And one gets stuck
with the thoughts.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.716 align:middle line:84%
The third best are what
we talk about, you see?

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And myth is that
field of reference,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
metaphors referring to what
is absolutely transcendent.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.192 align:middle line:90%
>> What can't be known.

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> What can't be known.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Or can't be named--

00:07:42.067 --> 00:07:42.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> --except in our own
feeble attempt to clothe it

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:90%
in language.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And the ultimate word in
our language for that which is

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:90%
transcendent is God.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you remember what went
through your mind the first

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
time you saw
Michelangelo's "Creation?"

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time I
became aware of that,

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:12.500 align:middle line:84%
my notion of divinity was
not quite so personal,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
the idea of God that he's a
bearded old man of some kind

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
with certain not very
pleasant temperament.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
That is, I would say,
a materialistic way

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of talking about
the transcendent.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> There's just the opposite
of it found on an island

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.970 align:middle line:84%
in the harbour of Bombay from
around the eighth century.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a wonderful cave.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
You enter the cave
from a bright sky.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, moving
into the darkness,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:90%
your eyes are blacked out.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
keep walking slowly,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:90%
gradually, the eyes adjust.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And this enormous thing-- it's
about 19 feet high and 19 feet

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:90%
across.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The central head is
the "Mask of Eternity."

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the mask of God.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>> "Mask of Eternity?"

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the metaphor
through which eternity is to be

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.295 align:middle line:90%
experienced as a radiance.

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And these are
the two figures?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever one moves
out of the transcendent,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
one comes into a
field of opposites.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
These two pairs of
opposites come forth as male

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and female from
the two sides, what

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:84%
has eaten of the tree
of the knowledge,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
not only of good and evil,
but of male and female,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:84%
of right and wrong, of this
and that, and light and dark.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
field of time is dual--

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
past and future, dead and alive.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
All this being and
non-being isn't.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the significance
of them being beside the mask

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:90%
of God, the "Mask of Eternity?"

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:84%
What is this sculpture
saying to us?

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The mask
represents the middle.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And the two represent
the two opposites.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:90%
And they always come in pairs.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And put your mind in the middle.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Most of us put our minds
on the side of the good,

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
against what we
think of as evil.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It was Heraclitus, I
think, who said, for God,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:84%
all things are good
and right and just.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But for man, some things are
right, and others are not.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
You're in the field of
time when you're man.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the powers of life
is to live in the realization

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:90%
of both terms.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
That's to say, I
know the center.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know that good
and evil are simply

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
temporal apparitions.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, are some myths more
or less true than others?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
They are true in different
senses, do you see?

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Here's a whole mythology
based on the insight that

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:90%
transcends duality.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Ours is a mythology that's
based on the inside of duality.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And so our religion tends to
be ethical in its accent--

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:84%
sin and atonement,
right and wrong.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:90%
It started with a sin, you see.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, moving out
of the mythological zone,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
the garden of paradise,
where there is no time

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and where men and
women don't even

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
know that they're
different from each other.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
The two are just creatures.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And God and man are
practically the same.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:10%
He walks in the cool of
the evening in the garden

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.640 align:middle line:10%
where we are.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they eat the
apple, the knowledge

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:90%
of the pairs of opposites.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And man and woman then
cover their shame.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.050 align:middle line:90%
God and man-- they're different.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:90%
Man in nature is against man.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I once heard a wonderful
lecture by Daisetsu Suzuki--

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:84%
remember this wonderful,
old Zen philosopher

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:90%
who was over here in his 90s.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
He started a lecture
in Switzerland

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.275 align:middle line:90%
that I heard in Ascona.

00:12:08.275 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
He stood up with his
hands on the side.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, God against
man, man against God,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
man against nature,
nature against man,

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
nature against God,
God against nature.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Very funny religion.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, in other mythologies,
one puts oneself

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:90%
in accord with the world.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
If the world is a
mixture of good and evil,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
you do not put yourself
in accord with it.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:90%
You identify with the good.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And you fight against the evil.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
religious system which

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
belongs to the Near East
following Zarathustra's time.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It's in the biblical tradition,
all the way, and Christianity

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and Islam as well, this business
of not being with nature.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.277 align:middle line:84%
And we speak with derogation
of the nature of religions.

00:13:02.277 --> 00:13:03.860 align:middle line:84%
You see, with that
fall in the garden,

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:90%
nature was regarded as corrupt.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:90%
There's a myth for you.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
That corrupts the
whole world for us.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And every spontaneous
act is sinful.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Because nature is corrupt
and has to be corrected,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:90%
must not be yielded to.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
You get a totally
different civilization,

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
a totally different
way of living,

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
according to your myth as
to whether nature has fallen

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.950 align:middle line:84%
or whether nature is itself
a manifestation of divinity

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit being the
revelation of the divinity

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:90%
that's inherent in nature.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>> But don't you think that
modern Americans have rejected

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
this idea, this Indian idea,
this ancient idea of nature

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:84%
as revealing the divinity,
because it would have kept us

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
from achieving
dominance over nature?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but that's the biblical
condemnation of nature that

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
they inherited from their own
religion and brought with them.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:90%
God is not in nature.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:90%
God is separate from nature.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And nature is not God.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And this distinction between
God and the world is not--

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.302 align:middle line:84%
be found in basic Hinduism
or Buddhism either.

00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:16.700 align:middle line:90%
[GONGS]

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget
the experience I

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
had when I was in Japan, to
be in a place that never heard

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
of the fall of the Garden
of Eden, to be in a place

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:84%
where I can read in one
of the Shinto texts.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The processes of nature cannot
be evil when every natural

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:84%
impulse is not to be corrected,
but to be sublimated,

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to be beautified and the
glorious interest in the beauty

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of nature, and
cooperation with nature,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and coordination so that
in some of those gardens,

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
you don't know where
nature begins and art ends.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.340 align:middle line:84%
This, to me, was a
tremendous experience,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and it's another mythology.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of
different mythologies,

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
let's just have a
little fun here.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I took these from your atlas.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll read Genesis.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll read from Genesis, and
then you identify and read

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:90%
from the corresponding paper.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Genesis 1--

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
"So God created man
in his own image.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
In the image of
God, He created him.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
Male and female--

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:90%
He created them.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Then God blessed them.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And God said to them, be
fruitful and multiply."

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And now, this is from a
legend of the Bassari people

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.305 align:middle line:90%
of West Africa.

00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:90%
"Unumbotte made a human being.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Its name was man.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Unumbotte next made an
antelope, named antelope.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Unumbotte made a
snake, named snake.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And Unumbotte said to them, the
Earth has not yet been pounded.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
You must pound the ground
smooth where you are sitting.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Unumbotte they gave them
seeds of all kinds and said,

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:90%
go plant these."

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>> And Genesis 1--

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
"And God-- so everything
that He had made and behold,

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:90%
it was very good."

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> And from the Upanishad--

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
"Then he realized, I
indeed am this creation.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
For I have poured it
forth from myself.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:84%
In that way, he
became this creation.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And verily, he who
knows this becomes

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
in this creation a creator."

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the clincher there.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
When you know this,
then you've identified

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
with the creator
principle yourself,

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
which is the God power in the
world, which means in you.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think we're
looking for when we subscribe

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
to one of these
theories of creation,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.290 align:middle line:84%
one of these
stories of creation?

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:90%
What are we looking for?

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think what
we're looking for is a way

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:84%
of experiencing the world in
which we are living that will

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
open to us the transcendent
that informs it and at the same

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
time, informs
ourselves within it.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%
That's what people want.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:90%
That's what the soul asks for.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean, we're looking for
some accord with the mystery

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
that informs all things, what
you call that vast ground

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.970 align:middle line:90%
of silence, which we all share?

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but not only to find
it, but to find that actually

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:84%
in our environment, in
our world to recognize it,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind of instruction
that will enable us to see

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:90%
the divine presence.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> In the world and in us.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And in India, this wonderful
Anjali, this greeting.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:90%
You know what that means?

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.752 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the greeting
of prayer, isn't it?

00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:45.110 align:middle line:90%
That's what we use for prayer.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.550 align:middle line:90%
They greet you with that.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
That's greeting the God
that's in you as you come in.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
These people are aware
of the divine presence.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.220 align:middle line:84%
When you enter an
Indian home as a guest,

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:90%
you are a visiting deity.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And you feel it, by god,
the way they treat you.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It's something in the
way of a hospitality

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that you don't get where
you have simply one

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:90%
person and another person.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the recognition
of the identity.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.808 align:middle line:84%
>> But weren't people
who told these stories,

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and believed them,
and acted on them,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
asking far more
simple questions--

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:90%
who made the world?

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:90%
How was the world made?

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Why was the world made?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I thought these are the
questions that these creation

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:90%
stories are trying to address.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
It's through that
answer that they

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.325 align:middle line:84%
see that the creator is
present in the whole world.

00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I mean?

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This story that
we've just read--

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I see that I am this
creation, says the God.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Or when you see that God
says He is the creation

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and then you are a
creature, well, the God

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
is within you and the man
you're talking to, also.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And so there's that
realization, two aspects

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:90%
of the one divinity.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Accord again.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Harmony again.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful thing.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you some questions
about these common features

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in these stories,
the significance

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.400 align:middle line:90%
of the forbidden fruit.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is this standard
folktale motif called the "One

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Forbidden Thing."

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember in "Bluebeard,"
don't open that closet.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:90%
And then one always does it.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And in the Old
Testament story, God

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:90%
gives the one forbidden thing.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And he knows very well.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm interpreting God.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
He knows very well
that man is going

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:90%
to eat the forbidden fruit.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's by doing
that, that man becomes

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:90%
the initiator of his own life.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Life really begins with that.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I also find in some
of these early stories,

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.995 align:middle line:84%
the human tendency to
find someone to blame.

00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me read Genesis 1.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll ask you to read
one from the Bassari legend.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Genesis 1-- "And
God said, have you

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
eaten from the tree
which I commanded you

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
that you should not eat?

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Then the man said, the woman
whom you gave to be with me--

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:90%
she gave me of the tree.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And I ate.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord God
said to the woman,

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:90%
what is this you've done?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And the woman said, the serpent
deceived me, and I ate."

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talk
about buck-passing.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It starts very early.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.813 align:middle line:90%
>> And then there's the Bassari.

00:20:15.813 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been tough
on serpents, too.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
"One day, snake said, we
too should eat these fruits.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Why must we go hungry?

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Antelope said, but we don't
know anything about this fruit.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Then man and his wife took some
of the fruit and ate it Well,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Unumbotte came down from the sky
and asked, who ate the fruit?

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They answered, we did.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Unumbotte asked, who told you
that you could eat that fruit?

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:90%
They replied snake did."

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.737 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:46.737 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the same story.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Poor snake.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.338 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the same story.

00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you make of this,
that in all of these stories,

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the principal actors are
pointing to someone else

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:90%
as the initiator of the fall?

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but it turns
out to be snake.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And snake in both
of these stories

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
is the symbol of life
throwing off the past

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:90%
and continuing to live.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>> The power of life.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the snake sheds
its skin, just as the moon

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.830 align:middle line:90%
sheds its shadow.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The snake in most
cultures is positive.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Even the most poisonous
snake in India, the cobra,

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:90%
is a sacred animal.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent, the Naga,
the Serpent King, Nagaraja,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:90%
is the next thing to the Buddha.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the serpent
represents the power

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
of life in the field of
time to throw off death.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha
represents the power

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
of life in the field of
eternity to be eternally alive.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I saw a fantastic thing
of a Burmese priestess, a snake

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
priestess who had to
bring rain to her people

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
by calling a king
cobra from his den

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and kissing him three
times on the nose.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
There's the cobra, the giver
of life, the giver of rain,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:90%
which is of life of the divine--

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.623 align:middle line:90%
positive, not negative figure.

00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The Christian
stories turn it around,

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.100 align:middle line:84%
because the serpent
was the seducer.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what that amounts to
is a refusal to affirm life.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Life is evil in this view.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Every natural impulse
is sinful, unless you've

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:84%
been baptized or circumcised
in this tradition

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.805 align:middle line:84%
that we've inherited,
for heaven's sakes.

00:22:37.805 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> By having been the tempter,
women have paid a great price.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Because in mythology,
some of this mythology,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.120 align:middle line:84%
they are the ones who
led to the downfall.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, they did.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they represent life.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Man doesn't enter
life, except by woman.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it is woman who brings
us into the world of polarities,

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and a pair of opposites,
and suffering and all.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
really childish attitude

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to say no to life
with all its pain.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Just say this is something
that should not have been.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.445 align:middle line:84%
Schopenhauer in one of
his marvelous chapters--

00:23:18.445 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it's in "The
World As Will and Idea,"

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:84%
says life is something
that should not have been.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
It is in its very essence and
character, a terrible thing

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:84%
to consider, this business of
living by killing and eating.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's in sin in terms
of all ethical judgments,

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>> As Zorba says trouble.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:90%
Life is trouble.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Only death is no trouble.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And when people say to me,
do you have optimism about

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the world, how terrible it is?

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Just say it's great
just the way it is.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> But doesn't that lead to
a rather passive attitude

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.010 align:middle line:84%
in the face of evil,
in the face of wrong?

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> You participate in it.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.188 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you do is
evil for somebody.

00:24:08.188 --> 00:24:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But explain that
for the audience.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you say yes
to that which you--

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I was in India,
there was a man whose name was

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Shri Krishna Menon.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And his mystical
name was Atmananda.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And he was in Trivandrum.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Trivandrum.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
wonderful privilege

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.320 align:middle line:84%
of sitting face
to face with him,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:90%
as I'm sitting here with you.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing he said to
me is, do you have a question?

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And because the teacher there
always answers questions.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't tell you anything.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:90%
He answers.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes,
I have a question.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
I said since in Hindu thinking,
all the universe is divine,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation
of divinity itself,

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
how can we say no to
anything in the world?

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:08.950 align:middle line:84%
How can we say no to brutality,
to stupidity, to vulgarity,

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:90%
to thoughtlessness?

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, for you and
me, you must say yes.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had learned
from my friends who

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:84%
were students of his
that that happened

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.330 align:middle line:84%
to have been the first
question he asked his guru.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And we had a wonderful talk
for about an hour there

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.410 align:middle line:84%
on this theme of the
affirmation of the world.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it confirmed
the inner feeling

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I have had that,
who are we to judge?

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that this
is one of the great teachings

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I see now what
you mean in one respect.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:84%
In some classic
Christian doctrine,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the world is to be despised.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Life is to be redeemed
in the hereafter.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It is heaven where
our rewards come.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you affirm that what
you deplore, as you say,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
you're affirming
the world, which

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:90%
is our eternity of the moment.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I would say.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Eternity isn't some later time.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Eternity isn't a long time.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Eternity has nothing
to do with time.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Eternity is that dimension
of here and now, which

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:90%
thinking in time cuts out.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> This is it.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my--

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't get it here,
you won't get it anywhere.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
of eternity right

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.810 align:middle line:84%
here and now is the
function of life.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
formula that the Buddhists

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:37.300 align:middle line:84%
have for the bodhisattva, the
one whose being, sattva, is

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
illumination,
bodhi, who realizes

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
his identity with eternity
and at the same time,

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:90%
his participation in time.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And the attitude is not
to withdraw from the world

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
when you realize
how horrible it is,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
but to realize that
this horror is simply

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:90%
the foreground of a wonder.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And come back and
participate in it.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:84%
All life is sorrowful is
the first Buddhist saying.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be life if there
were not temporality involved,

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.780 align:middle line:84%
which is sorrow,
loss, loss, loss.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a pessimistic note.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, you got to say
yes to it and say it's great

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:18.750 align:middle line:90%
this way.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's the
way God intended it.

00:27:20.925 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't really
believe that?

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> But that's the way it is.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
anybody intended it,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.940 align:middle line:90%
but this is the way it is.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:90%
And Joyce's wonderful line--

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.390 align:middle line:84%
"History is a nightmare from
which I'm trying to awake."

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And the way to awake from
it is not to be afraid

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and to recognize, as I
did, in my conversation

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:84%
with that Hindu guru or
teacher that I told you of,

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that all of this as it
is, is as it has to be.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And it is a manifestation of the
eternal presence in the world.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The end of things
always is painful.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Pain is part of there
being a world at all.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But if one accepted that
isn't the ultimate conclusion

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, I won't try to
reform any laws or fight any

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:90%
battles or--

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't say that.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't the logical--
couldn't one draw that, though,

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.900 align:middle line:90%
the philosophy of nihilism?

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's not the
necessary thing to draw.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:84%
You could say, I will
participate in this row,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
and I will join the army,
and I will go to war.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll do the best I can.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I will participate
in the game.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful, wonderful
opera, except that it hurts.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And that wonderful
Irish saying--

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.922 align:middle line:84%
"Is this a private fight or
can anybody get into it?"

00:28:47.922 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the way life is.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And the hero is the one who
can participate in it decently

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
in the way of nature,
not in the way

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
of personal rancor, revenge,
or anything of the kind.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you one story
here of a samurai warrior,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
a Japanese warrior who
had the duty to avenge

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.890 align:middle line:90%
the murder of his overlord.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And he actually,
after some time,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
found and cornered the man
who had murdered his overlord.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And he was about to deal with
him with his samurai sword

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.780 align:middle line:84%
when this man in the corner,
in the passion of the terror,

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.610 align:middle line:90%
spat in his face.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And the samurai sheathed
the sword and walked away.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Why did he do that?

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Because he was made angry.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And if he had killed
that man then,

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
a personal act.

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:90%
That was another kind of act.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
he had come to do.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me tell you what
happens to me when I read these

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:84%
stories, no matter the
culture of their origin.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I feel first this
sense of wonder

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.440 align:middle line:84%
at the spectacle of
the human imagination,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.062 align:middle line:84%
simply groping to try to
understand this existence.

00:30:05.062 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Does that ever happen to you?

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I tell you, mythology--

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I think of as the
homeland of the muses--

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the inspirers of art,
the inspirers of poetry.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And to see life as
a poem and yourself

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.200 align:middle line:84%
participating in a poem is
what the myth does for you.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you mean a poem?

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean a vocabulary
in the form not of words,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:84%
but of acts and adventures,
which is connotative,

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.030 align:middle line:84%
which connotes something
transcendent of the action here

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and which yet informs
the whole thing.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So you always feel in accord
with the universal being.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the interesting
thing to me is that far from

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
undermining my faith, your
work in mythology has liberated

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
my faith from the cultural
prisons to which it had been

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
sentenced.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It liberated my own.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I know it's going to
do it with everybody

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.990 align:middle line:90%
who really gets the message.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Every mythology, every
religion is true in this sense.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It is true as metaphorical of
the human and cosmic mystery.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But when it gets
stuck to the metaphor,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.390 align:middle line:90%
then you're in trouble.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> The metaphor being--

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jesus
ascended to heaven.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:84%
The story is He ascended
bodily to heaven.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:84%
The story is that his
mother, still alive, asleep,

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:90%
ascended to heaven.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is metaphorical
of something.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to throw it away.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.620 align:middle line:84%
All you have to find
is what it's saying.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
think it is saying?

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.417 align:middle line:84%
>> What it's saying is
He didn't go out there.

00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:47.240 align:middle line:84%
He went in here, which is
where you must go, too,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and ascend to heaven
through the inward space

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to that source from which
you and all life came.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the sense of that.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But aren't you undermining
one of the great cardinal

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.450 align:middle line:84%
doctrines of the tradition of
classic Christian faith that

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.580 align:middle line:84%
death, the burial, and
the Resurrection of Jesus

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:11.480 align:middle line:84%
pre-figuring our own and
overcoming the body with

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.030 align:middle line:90%
a higher physical truth?

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that would be what I
would call the mistaken reading

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:90%
of the symbol.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.130 align:middle line:84%
That's reading it
in terms of prose,

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:90%
instead of in terms of poetry.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:90%
That's reading it.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's reading a metaphor
in terms of the denotation,

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
instead of in terms
of the connotation.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a purely literary problem.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The poetry gets to
the unseen reality.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>> That which is beyond
even the concept of reality.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's that which
transcends all thought.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It's putting you there all
the time and in some way,

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
giving you a line to connect
with that mystery which

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
you are.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:90%
And the myths do it, by gosh.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.940 align:middle line:90%
They do it.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to the normal way
of thinking about the Christian

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.010 align:middle line:84%
religion, we cannot
identify with Jesus.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:90%
We have to imitate Jesus.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But to say, I am God, as Jesus
said, is, for us, blasphemy.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:84%
However, in the Thomas
gospel, Jesus says,

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:84%
he who drinks from my
mouth will become as I am.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And I shall be he.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's Buddhism.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
We are all manifestations
of Buddha consciousness,

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:90%
only don't know it.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddha-- the word
means the one who waked up.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
"Budd", to wake,
woke up to the fact

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that he was Buddha
consciousness.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And we are all to do that.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:50.000 align:middle line:84%
To wake up to our
Jesus within us--

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
this is blasphemy
in the normal way

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.690 align:middle line:90%
of thinking in Christianity.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's the very
essence of Gnosticism

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and of the Thomas gospel.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And heaven, that desired goal
of most people, is within us?

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Heaven and hell
are within us.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And all the gods are within us.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:84%
This is the great realization
of the Upanishads of India,

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:16.880 align:middle line:84%
already in the ninth century BC,
all the gods, all the heavens,

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.639 align:middle line:90%
all the worlds within us.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:24.889 align:middle line:90%
They are magnified dreams.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:84%
And what dreams are
our manifestations

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
in image form of the energies
of the body in conflict

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.360 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.699 align:middle line:90%
And that's all myth is.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:84%
Myth is a manifestation
in symbolic images,

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:44.389 align:middle line:84%
metaphorical images of
the energies within us,

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:48.080 align:middle line:84%
moved by the organs of the body
in conflict with each other.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.594 align:middle line:90%
This organ wants this.

00:34:49.594 --> 00:34:50.900 align:middle line:90%
This organ wants this.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.500 align:middle line:90%
The brain is one of the organ.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we dream, are we
fishing in some vast ocean

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.239 align:middle line:90%
of mythology that we--

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It goes down
and down and down.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can get all
mixed up with complexes,

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But you're standing on the
lord of the abyss, really.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a Polynesian saying
that comes to my mind--

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:17.780 align:middle line:84%
"standing on a whale
fishing for minnows."

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:90%
We are standing on a whale.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.520 align:middle line:84%
The ground of being is
the ground of our being.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.440 align:middle line:90%
And the outward turned--

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
we see all these
little problems here.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But inward, we are the
source of them all.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:84%
That's the big
mystical teaching.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> You've seen what's happened
to primitive societies that are

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.880 align:middle line:84%
unsettled by white
men civilization.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.030 align:middle line:90%
They go to pieces.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.920 align:middle line:90%
They disintegrate.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.960 align:middle line:84%
They succumb to
vice and disease.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And isn't that the
same thing that's

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.860 align:middle line:84%
been happening to us since
our myths began to disappear?

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, it is.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that why conservative
religious folk today are

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:52.910 align:middle line:84%
calling for a return to
the old-time religion?

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand the yearning.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:55.970 align:middle line:90%
In my youth.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.620 align:middle line:90%
I had fixed stars.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.380 align:middle line:84%
They comforted me
with their permanence.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.810 align:middle line:90%
They gave me a known horizon.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.960 align:middle line:84%
They told me that there's a
loving, kind, and just father

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.690 align:middle line:84%
out there looking down on
me, ready to receive me,

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:84%
thinking of my
concerns all the time.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Now science, medicine has made
it a housecleaning of belief.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder what
happens to children

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:22.970 align:middle line:84%
who don't have that fixed
star, that known horizon,

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.340 align:middle line:90%
those myths to sustain them.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.215 align:middle line:84%
>> All they have to do
is read the newspaper.

00:36:26.215 --> 00:36:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a mess.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But what the myth
has to provide--

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just on
this immediate level

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of life instruction, the
pedagogical aspect of myth--

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:90%
it has to give life models.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And the models have
to be appropriate

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to the possibilities of the
time in which you're living.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:90%
And our time has changed.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Ant it's changed and changed.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And it continues
to change so fast

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:84%
that what was proper 50 years
ago is not proper today.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the virtues of the
past are the vices of today.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And many of what were thought
to be the vices of the past

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.180 align:middle line:90%
are the necessities of today.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And the moral order
has to catch up

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:84%
with the moral necessities
of actual life in time,

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.140 align:middle line:90%
here and now.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's not doing.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
ridiculous to go back

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.560 align:middle line:90%
to the old-time religion.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Friend of mine
composed a song based

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.900 align:middle line:84%
on the old-time religion--
give me the old-time religion.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Give me-- let us worship
Zarathustra just the way

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.265 align:middle line:90%
we used to.

00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Zarathustra booster.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:28.520 align:middle line:90%
He's good enough for me.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Let us worship Aphrodite.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:90%
She's beautiful, but flighty.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't wear a nightie,
but she's good enough for me.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back to
the old-time religion,

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:84%
you're doing
something like that.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It belongs to another
age, another people,

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:46.430 align:middle line:84%
another set of human
values, another universe.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So the old period of the
Old Testament-- no one

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:90%
had any idea.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The world was a little
three-layer cake.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the world
consisted of something

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:84%
a few hundred miles around the
Near Eastern centers there.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:05.210 align:middle line:84%
No one ever heard of the
Aztecs or the Chinese, even.

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And so those whole
peoples were not

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.570 align:middle line:84%
considered even as part of
the problem to be dealt with.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:90%
The world changes.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.563 align:middle line:84%
Then the religion has
to be transformed.

00:38:14.563 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But it seems to me, that
is what we are, in fact,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:17.530 align:middle line:90%
doing here.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> That's, in fact,
what we better do.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But my notion of what the real
horror today is what you see in

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Beirut where you have the
three great Western religions--

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And because the three of them
have three different names

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.430 align:middle line:84%
for the same biblical God,
they can't get on together.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:84%
They're stuck with
their metaphor

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and don't realize its reference.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> So each needs a new myth.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Each needs its own
myth, all the way.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Love thy enemy.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Open up, don't judge.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Given what you know
about human beings,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:84%
is it conceivable to you that
there is a point of wisdom

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.630 align:middle line:84%
beyond the conflicts of truth
and illusion by which our lives

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.310 align:middle line:90%
can be put back together again--

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.043 align:middle line:84%
>> --that we could
develop new models?

00:39:02.043 --> 00:39:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It's in the religions.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:84%
All religions are
true for their time.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
If you can find
what the truth is

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and separate it from
the temporal inflection,

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:16.190 align:middle line:84%
just bring your
same old religion

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:90%
into a new set of metaphors.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And you've got it.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see some new metaphors
emerging in the modern medium

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:28.310 align:middle line:84%
for the old universal truths
that you've talked about,

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:90%
the old story?

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
that the "Star Wars"

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:84%
is a valid mythological
perspective.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And the problem of,
is the machine--

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:90%
and the state is a machine.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Is the machine going to crush
humanity or serve humanity?

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And humanity comes not from the
machine, but from the heart.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.948 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.948 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Luke, help me
take this mask off.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>> But you'll die.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was in
the "Return of the Jedi"

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.550 align:middle line:84%
when Skywalker
unmasks his father.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:84%
The father had been playing one
of these machine roles, a state

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:15.870 align:middle line:90%
role.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:90%
He was the uniform.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:24.045 align:middle line:84%
And the removal of that mask
was an undeveloped man there.

00:40:24.045 --> 00:40:29.910 align:middle line:84%
There was kind of a worm by
being executive of a system.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:84%
One is not developing
one's humanity.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I think that George
Lucas really,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.820 align:middle line:84%
really did a
beautiful thing there.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of machine is the
idea that we want the world

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.100 align:middle line:84%
to be made in our image and what
we think the world ought to be.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first time
anybody made a tool--

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, taking a
stone and chipping it

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
so you can handle it-- that's
the beginning of a machine.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.130 align:middle line:84%
It's turning out of
nature into your service.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:05.610 align:middle line:84%
But then there comes a time when
it begins to dictate to you.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a bit-- this
struggle with my computer.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Your computer?

00:41:09.763 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Just bought-- what?

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.638 align:middle line:90%
A couple of months ago.

00:41:11.638 --> 00:41:15.435 align:middle line:84%
And I can't help thinking of
it as having a personality

00:41:15.435 --> 00:41:17.820 align:middle line:90%
there, because it talks back.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And it behaves in a whimsical
way and all of that.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm personifying
that machine to meet

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:28.290 align:middle line:90%
that machine as almost alive.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.153 align:middle line:84%
I could mythologize
that darn thing.

00:41:30.153 --> 00:41:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a wonderful
story about, I think,

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:84%
President Eisenhower when the
computer was first being built.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:90%
You remember that story?

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Eisenhower went into
a room full of computers.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And he puts the question
to these machines--

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:90%
is there a God?

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And they all start up.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's all those lights
flashing, and wheels turning,

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And after about 10 minutes
of that kind of thing,

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:90%
a voice comes forth.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And the voice
says, now there is.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.536 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:01.536 --> 00:42:02.336 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.336 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I bought this
wonderful IBM machine.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's there.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm rather an authority on
God, so I identified the God.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me
an Old Testament God

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.650 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of
rules and no mercy.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's unforgiving, isn't it?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Catch you picking up sticks
on Saturday and you're out.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:24.840 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But isn't it possible to
develop toward the computer,

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.450 align:middle line:84%
the computer you're wrestling
with at this very moment?

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it possible to develop
the same kind of attitude

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Pawnee chieftain
who said that in the legend

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of his people, all
things speak of Tirawa?

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.230 align:middle line:90%
All things speak of God.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a special,
privileged revelation.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.420 align:middle line:84%
God is everywhere in his
works, including the computers.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, indeed so.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the miracle of what
happens on that screen with--

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.890 align:middle line:84%
have you ever looked
inside one of those things?

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You can believe it.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole hierarchy
of angels all on slats

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:90%
and those little tubes.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Those are miracles.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.270 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>> One can feel a sense of awe.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've had a revelation
for my computer about

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.750 align:middle line:90%
mythology, though.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:90%
You buy a certain software.

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole set
of signals that lead

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.690 align:middle line:90%
to the achievement of your aim.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And once you've set it for,
let's say, DW3, Enter--

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.563 align:middle line:84%
if you begin fooling
around with signals

00:43:30.563 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:84%
that belong to another
system, they just won't work.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You have a system there, a
determined code that requires

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:90%
you to use certain terms.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, similarly in
mythology, each religion

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:48.450 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of software that
has its own set of signals

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.790 align:middle line:90%
and will work.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:90%
It'll work.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But suppose you've
chosen this one.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, if a person is really
involved in a religion

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and really building
his life on it,

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:02.280 align:middle line:84%
he better stay with the
software that he's got.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But a chap like myself
who likes to play with--

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Cross the wires?

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --the various softwares,
I can run around.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But I probably will
never have an experience

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.642 align:middle line:90%
comparable to that of a saint.

00:44:14.642 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But do you think that the
machine is inventing new myths

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.320 align:middle line:84%
for us or that we with the
machine are inventing new

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.120 align:middle line:90%
myths?

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Is the machine becoming--

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> No, the myth has
to incorporate--

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --the deity?

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --the machine, just as
the old myths incorporated

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:90%
the tools that people used.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The forms of the
tools and so forth

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
power systems that

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:90%
are involved in the culture.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.300 align:middle line:84%
We have not a mythology
that incorporates these.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The new powers of
being, so to say,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.100 align:middle line:84%
surprisingly announced to us
by what the machines can do.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We can't have a mythology for
a long, long time to come.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Things are changing too fast.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The environment
which we are living

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:84%
is changing too fast for
it to become mythologized.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.460 align:middle line:90%
You must realize--

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how do we live
without myths then?

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they're doing it.

00:45:02.043 --> 00:45:05.510 align:middle line:84%
The individual has to
find the aspect of myth

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with the
conduct of his life.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.060 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
services that myths serve.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:84%
The basic one is
opening the world

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.450 align:middle line:90%
to the dimension of mystery.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.320 align:middle line:84%
If you lose that, you
don't have a mythology

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to realize the mystery
that underlies all forms.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But then there comes the
cosmological aspect of myth,

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.840 align:middle line:84%
seeing that mystery as
manifest through all things.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So the universe becomes,
as it were, a holy picture.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.850 align:middle line:84%
You are always addressed
to the transcendent mystery

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:42.180 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.650 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
another function.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's the sociological one
of validating and maintaining

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.140 align:middle line:90%
a certain society.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.120 align:middle line:84%
That is the side
of the thing that

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.785 align:middle line:90%
has taken over in our world.

00:45:51.785 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>> And what do you mean?

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Ethical laws, the laws
of life in the society,

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:02.465 align:middle line:84%
all of Yahweh's pages and
pages and pages of what kind

00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:04.710 align:middle line:84%
of clothes to wear, how
to behave to each other,

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:05.510 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you see in
terms of the values

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:10.588 align:middle line:90%
of this particular society?

00:46:10.588 --> 00:46:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a
fourth function of myth.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is the one that
I think, today, everyone

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.600 align:middle line:90%
must try to relate to.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the pedagogical function,
how to live a human lifetime

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
under any circumstances.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Myth can tell you that.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful story
in one of the Upanishads,

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:84%
the Brahmavaivarta
Upanisad of Indra,

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:84%
this god who is the
counterpart, really, of Yahweh.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
He is the God patron
of a certain people

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and of historical life
and time with all kinds

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.780 align:middle line:84%
of rules for people to live
by and that sort of thing.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time
when a great monster

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:53.240 align:middle line:84%
named Vritra had closed all
the waters of the Earth.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
terrible drought.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And the world was in
very bad condition.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, it took this god
Indra quite a while

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to realize that he had a
box of thunderbolts there.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And all he had to do was
drop a thunderbolt in Vritra

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.180 align:middle line:90%
and then blow him up.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And when he did that, of
course, he blew Vritra up.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And the waters flowed.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And the world was refreshed.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said what
a great boy am I.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So thinking what
a great boy am I,

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.670 align:middle line:84%
he goes up to the
cosmic mountain,

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.350 align:middle line:84%
which is the central
mountain of the world.

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And so he decided he would
build a new world up there,

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:27.500 align:middle line:90%
a new city.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And particularly,
his palace was going

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.150 align:middle line:84%
to be a palace
worthy of such as he.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:37.070 align:middle line:84%
So he calls Vishvakarman, the
main carpenter of the gods,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and gives him the assignment
to build this palace.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:90%
So Vishvakarman goes to work.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And in very quick order,
he gets the palace

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.990 align:middle line:90%
into pretty good condition.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:90%
And Indra comes.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.800 align:middle line:84%
But every time Indra
arrived, he had

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.100 align:middle line:84%
bigger ideas about how big and
grandiose the palace should be.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
Vishvakarman says, my gosh.

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.780 align:middle line:84%
He says, now, we're
both immortal.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's no end
to his desires.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:01.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm caught for life.

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So he decided to go to
Brahma, known as the creator,

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and complain.

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, Brahma
sits on a lotus.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the symbol of divine
energy and divine grace.

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And the lotus grows from
the navel of Vishnu,

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.700 align:middle line:84%
who is the sleeping God,
whose dream is the universe.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So here's Brahma on his lotus.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And Vishvakarman
comes through the edge

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:30.290 align:middle line:84%
of the great lotus
pond of the universe

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and, down, he tells his story.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Brahma says, you go home.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.000 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'll fix this up.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So next morning at
the gate of the palace

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that's being built,
there appears

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:49.280 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful blue-black boy with
a lot of children around him,

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.560 align:middle line:84%
just in admiration
of his beauty.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So in comes the boy and
Indra on his throne.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:56.900 align:middle line:90%
He's the king god.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:90%
He says, young man, welcome.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And what brings
you to my palace?

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, says the boy with a
voice like thunder rolling

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:12.520 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon, I've
been told that you're

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:18.100 align:middle line:84%
building such a palace as no
Indra before you ever built.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've surveyed the
grounds and looked things over.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.770 align:middle line:90%
It seems this is quite true.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
No Indra before you has
ever built such a palace.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, Indra says, Indras
before me, young man?

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.790 align:middle line:90%
What are you're talking about?

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:40.670 align:middle line:90%
The boy says Indras before you--

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:47.620 align:middle line:84%
he says, I have seen them
come and go, come and go.

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:53.490 align:middle line:84%
He said just think, Vishnu
sleeps in the cosmic ocean.

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:84%
The lotus of the universe
grows from his navel.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.350 align:middle line:84%
On there, sits
Brahma, the creator.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Brahma opens his eyes, a
world comes into being.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Governed by an Indra,
closes his eyes.

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:09.210 align:middle line:90%
The world goes out of being.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Opens his eyes, the world comes
into being, closes his eyes.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And the life of a Brahma is
432,000 years and he dies.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.130 align:middle line:90%
The lotus goes back.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Another Lotus, another Brahma.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Then think of the
galaxies beyond galaxies

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:35.280 align:middle line:84%
in infinite space, each a lotus
with the Brahma sitting on it,

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.730 align:middle line:84%
opening his eyes, closing
his eyes with Indras.

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.010 align:middle line:84%
There may be wise
men in your court

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:44.250 align:middle line:84%
who would volunteer to
count the drops of water

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.680 align:middle line:84%
in the oceans of the world
or the grains of sand

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.670 align:middle line:90%
on the beaches.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:50.190 align:middle line:84%
But no one would
count those Brahmas,

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.130 align:middle line:90%
let alone those Indras.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And while he's talking,
there comes in parade

00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:00.270 align:middle line:84%
across the floor of the
palace, an army of ants

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.030 align:middle line:90%
in perfect range.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And the boy laughs
when he sees them.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And Indra's hair goes up.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks-- he says to
the boy, why do you laugh?

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And the boy says,
don't ask, unless you

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.330 align:middle line:90%
are willing to be hurt.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And Indra says, I ask.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Teach.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:27.450 align:middle line:90%
The boy says former Indras, all.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Through many lifetimes they
rise from the lowest condition

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.710 align:middle line:84%
spiritually to
highest illumination.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they drop their
thunderbolt in Vritra.

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And they think, what a good boy
am I and down they go again.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And then Indra sits
there on the throne.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's completely
disillusioned,

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.320 align:middle line:90%
completely shot, anything.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's quit the
building of this palace.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.330 align:middle line:84%
He calls Vishvakarman and
says, you're dismissed.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:01.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to-- so
Vishvakarman got his intention.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.920 align:middle line:90%
He's dismissed from the job.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's no more
house-building going on.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And Indra decides, I'm
going out and be a yogi

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and just meditate on the
lotus feet of Vishnu.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But he has a beautiful
queen named Indrani.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And when Indrani hears this,
she goes to the priest,

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.730 align:middle line:90%
the chaplain of the gods.

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And she says, now, he's
got this idea in his head.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:90%
He's going out to become a yogi.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, says the Brahmin,
come in with me, darling.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And we'll sit down.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'll fix this up.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.330 align:middle line:90%
So he talks to Indra.

00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:38.130 align:middle line:90%
They come in.

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They sit down before
the king's throne.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And he tells him, now, I wrote
a book for you some years ago

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:48.270 align:middle line:90%
on the art of politics.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:50.460 align:middle line:84%
You are in the
position of the king.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You are the position
of the king of gods.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:55.440 align:middle line:84%
You are a manifestation
of the mystery of Brahmin

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.530 align:middle line:90%
in the field of time.

00:52:56.530 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:90%
This is a high privilege.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Appreciate it, honor
it, and deal with life

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.810 align:middle line:84%
as though you were
what you really are.

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And with this set
of instructions,

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Indra gives up his idea of
going out, becoming a yogi

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and finds that in life, he
can represent the eternal

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:17.370 align:middle line:84%
in the way of a
symbol, you might

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:22.140 align:middle line:84%
say, of the Brahmin
and the ultimate truth.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So each of us is, in a way,
the Indra of his own life.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can make a
choice either to go out

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.120 align:middle line:84%
in the forest and meditate,
and throw it all off,

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:84%
or stay in the world and in the
life either of your job, which

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.010 align:middle line:84%
is the kingly job of the
politics and achievement,

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and as well in the love life
with your wife and family.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.740 align:middle line:90%
You are realizing the truth.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a very nice
myth, it seems to me.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Do we ever know the truth?

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Do we ever find it?

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, each person can
have his own depth experience

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and some conviction of being in
touch with his own Satyananda,

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:09.810 align:middle line:84%
his own being, true
consciousness, and true bliss.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But the religious
people tell us we really

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.480 align:middle line:84%
won't experience it till we
go to heaven, till you die.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I believe in having as much
as you can of this experience

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.740 align:middle line:90%
while you're alive.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Our bliss is now.

00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in heaven, you'll
be having such a marvelous time

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:32.490 align:middle line:84%
looking at God that you won't
get your own experience at all.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:33.870 align:middle line:90%
That's not the place to have it.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's the place to
have the experience.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Here and now.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Here and now.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:42.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:42.890 --> 00:56:20.000 align:middle line:90%
