>> Every hill and mountain
shall be made low.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
The rough places
would be made plain

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%

will be made straight.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
We have only to follow the
thread of the hero path.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And where we had thought
to find an abomination,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.866 align:middle line:90%
we shall find a god.

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And where we had
thought to slay another,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:90%
we shall slay ourselves.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Where we had thought
to travel outward,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
we should come to the
center of our own existence.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.553 align:middle line:84%
And where we had
thought to be alone,

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:43.845 align:middle line:90%
we shall be with all the world.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Joseph Campbell on
the hero's adventure.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:84%
He was the teacher everyone
would like to have.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:84%
He was the archetype, to use
one of his favorite words.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:90%
The original, the ideal.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.260 align:middle line:84%
One of his students at Sarah
Lawrence College where Campbell

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
taught for almost 40
years described him

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
as a "beaming flashlight
into the darkness."

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:10%
The director George
Lucas said of Campbell,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.320 align:middle line:10%
if it hadn't been for him,
it's possible I would still

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.020 align:middle line:10%
be trying to write "Star Wars."

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
When I met him late in
his life, college students

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
across the country
had been reading

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Campbell's influential book,
"The Hero with a Thousand

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Faces," for years.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Scholars poured over his
four-volume study of mythology,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.980 align:middle line:90%
"The Mask of God."

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Now he was working on a
monumental "Historical Atlas

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:90%
of World Mythology."

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Yet beyond the classroom
and lecture halls,

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:84%
only a relative
handful of people

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
had ever seen Joseph Campbell
in person or heard him speak.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:90%
That changed with our series.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:84%
As the broadcast played out
over six consecutive weeks,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the accumulating
insight and wisdom

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
had an enormous,
unexpected impact.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of letters poured
into public television stations

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:90%
around the country.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
One that I received soon
after the first broadcast

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
from a woman in Kew
Gardens, New York,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
summed up the
collective reaction.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
She said, "I will
never be the same."

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The series has been
repeated over the years,

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and people continue to stop
in public to say simply,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Joseph Campbell changed my life.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I say to all of them, yes,
he was a great teacher.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But exactly how and
why he touched so many

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:90%
different lives, I can't say.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:90%
But I can say this.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.400 align:middle line:84%
At a time when
millions of people

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
were yearning for a
way of talking about

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:84%
religious experience without
regard to a rigid belief

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
system, Campbell gave
them the language for it.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
He said myths were clues
to our spiritual nature,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and they could help guide
us to a sacred place

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
within where we might unlock
the creative power of our deeper

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:90%
unconscious self.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the brilliant clarity

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:84%
he brought to the great and
enduring theme of mythology

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
across the ages, the
hero's adventure.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
He tracked that
theme in the symbols,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
stories, and rituals
that keep appearing

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures, coming
alive in literature, art,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and religion, and today
in movies, comic books,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and yes, video games.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Campbell believed the
most heroic of all acts

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
is the courage to
discover who you are

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:90%
and what you would like to be.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:84%
To slay the savage
dragon of the ego

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and to follow your bliss
to the truth of your life.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.370 align:middle line:84%
We taped these conversations
at George Lucas' Skywalker

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Ranch in California
over the last two

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:90%
summers of Campbell's life.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, we began with his
favorite subject, "The Hero

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:90%
with a Thousand Faces."

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Why "The Hero with
a Thousand Faces?"

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because there is a
certain typical hero sequence

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
of actions which can be detected
in stories from all over

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
the world and from many,
many periods of history.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
essentially, you might say,

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
the one deed done by many,
many different people.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are there so many
stories of the hero or of heroes

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:90%
in mythology?

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because that's
what's worth writing about.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in popular
novel writing, you see these.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The main character is
a hero or a heroine.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, someone who
has found or achieved or done

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
something beyond the
normal range of achievement

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:90%
and experience.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:84%
A hero properly
is someone who has

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
given his life to something
bigger than himself

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:90%
or other than himself.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So when all of
these cultures,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever the costume the
hero might be wearing,

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:90%
what is the deed?

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are
two types of deed.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
One is the physical
deed, the hero

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:84%
who has performed a war act
or a physical act of heroism.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Saving a life,
that's a hero act.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Giving himself, sacrificing
himself to another.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And the other kind
is the spiritual hero

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:03.522 align:middle line:84%
who has learned or found a
mode of experiencing the--

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
[SIGH] the super-normal range
of human spiritual life and then

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:90%
come back and communicated it.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a cycle.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a going and a return that
the hero cycle represents.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
But then this can be seen also
in the simple initiation ritual

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
where a child has to give up his
childhood and become an adult.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
Has to die, you might say,
to his infantile personality

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and psyche and come back as
a self-responsible adult.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a fundamental experience
that everyone has to undergo.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We're in our childhood
for at least 14 years,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and then to get
out of that posture

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of dependency,
psychological dependency

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
into one of psychological
self-responsibility

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
requires a death
and resurrection.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is the basic
motif of the hero journey,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:84%
leaving one condition,
finding the source of life

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:13.950 align:middle line:84%
to bring you forth in a
richer or more mature or other

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So that if we happen not to
be heroes in the grand sense

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
of redeeming society, we have
to take that journey ourselves

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
spiritually,
psychologically inside us.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And Otto Rank in his
wonderful very short book

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
called "The Myth of
the Birth of the Hero,"

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
he says that everyone
is a hero in his birth.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:84%
He has undergone a
tremendous transformation

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
from a little, you might
say, water creature,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
living in a realm of
the amniotic fluid

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
then coming out,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
becoming an air-breathing
mammal that ultimately will

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:90%
be self-standing and so forth.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It's an enormous transformation,
and it is a heroic act.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's a heroic act
on the mother's part

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:90%
to bring it about.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
That's the primary hero,
hero form, you might say.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Still a journey to
be taken after that.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a big
one to be taken.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And that journey is not
consciously undertaken.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Do heroes go out on
their own initiative?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there are both kinds.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:84%
A very common one that appears
in Celtic myths of someone who

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
has followed the lure
of a deer or animal

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that he has been
following, and then

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:84%
carries him into a range
of forest and landscape

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
responsibly and intentionally
to perform the deed.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%

himself for something.

That's a judgment
from another side.

but they are three temptations.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And one is that of lust,
another is that of fear,

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and another is that of social
duty, doing what you're told.

these men come back

Muhammad literally, and
we know this about him.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
He was a camel caravan master,
but he would leave his home

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and go out into a little
mountain cave that he found

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and meditate and meditate
and meditate and meditate.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:90%
And one day a voice says, write.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:90%
And we have the Quran, you know?

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:90%
It's an old story.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes it seems to me
that we ought to feel pity

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
for the hero instead
of admiration.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So many of them have
sacrificed their own needs.

by the inability of
the followers to see.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
You come out of the forest with
gold and it turns to ashes.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
That's another
motif that occurs.

>> In this culture of easy
religion, cheaply achieved,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.100 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me we've forgotten
that all three of the great

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.470 align:middle line:84%
religions teach that the
trials of the hero journey are

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:84%
a significant part of it,
that there's no reward without

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:84%
renunciation and
without the price.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
The Quran speaks, "Do
you think that you

shall enter the garden of
bliss without such trials

as come to those who
passed before you?"

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you realize
what the real problem is,

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and that is of losing primary--

primarily thinking
about yourself

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and your own self-protection.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Losing yourself, giving
yourself to another.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
That's a trial in
itself, is it not?

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a big transformation of
consciousness that's concerned.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And what all the myths
have to deal with

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:84%
is transformation
of consciousness,

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
that you're thinking in
this way and you have now

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:90%
to think in that way.

consciousness transformed?

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%

>> The test that the hero--

>> Tests are certain
illuminating revelations.

Trials and revelations
are what it's all about.

Do movies create heroes?

>> I don't know.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, my experience of movies--

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the significant
experience I had in movies

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:90%
was when I was a boy.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And they were all really movies.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:90%
They weren't talkies.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.020 align:middle line:90%
comes to meet him.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
two or three results.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.290 align:middle line:84%
One, the hero is cut
to pieces and descends

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:44.720 align:middle line:84%
into the abyss in fragments
to be resurrected,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:84%
or he may kill the dragon
power, as Siegfried

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:90%
does when he kills the dragon.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But then he tastes
the dragon blood.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
That's-- he has to
assimilate that power.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And when Siegfried
has killed the dragon

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and tasted the blood, he
hears the song of nature.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:84%
He has transcended his
humanity, you know?

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And re-associated
himself with the powers

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of nature, which are
the powers of our life

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:90%
from which our mind removes us.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.700 align:middle line:84%
You see, this thing up
here, this consciousness

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.200 align:middle line:90%
thinks it's running the shop.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a secondary organ.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a secondary organ
of a total human being.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And it must not put
itself in control.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
It must submit and serve
the humanity of the body.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Join me, and I will
complete your training.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> When it does put itself in
control, you get this father,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
the man who's gone over
to the intellectual side.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll never join you!

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> If you only knew the
power of the dark side.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> He isn't thinking or
living in terms of humanity.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:84%
He's living in
terms of a system.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
threat to our lives.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:90%
We all face it.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:84%
We all operate in our society
in relation to a system.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, is the system going to
eat you up and relieve you

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.610 align:middle line:90%
of your humanity?

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Or are you going
to be able to use

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:90%
the system to human purposes?

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Would "The Hero
with a Thousand Faces"

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:84%
help us to answer that question
about how to change the system

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:90%
so that we are not serving it?

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think it would
help you to change the system,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:84%
but it would help you to live
in the system as a human being.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> By doing what?

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, like Luke Skywalker,
not going over but resisting.

00:27:49.895 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It's impersonal claims.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But I can hear someone out
there in the audience saying,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
well, that's all well and good
for the imagination of a George

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Lucas or for the scholarship
of a Joseph Campbell,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.310 align:middle line:84%
but that isn't what
happens in my life.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>> You bet it does.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
If the person doesn't
listen to the demands

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.920 align:middle line:84%
of his own spiritual
and heart life

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and insists on a
certain program,

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.050 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a
schizophrenic crack-up.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The person has put
himself off center.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.870 align:middle line:84%
He has aligned himself
with a programmatic life,

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's not the one the
body's interested in at all.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And the world's full of
people who have stopped

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:90%
listening to themselves.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
In my own life, I've
had many opportunities

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
to commit myself to a
system and to go with it

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:90%
and to obey its requirements.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
My life has been
that of a maverick.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:90%
I would not submit.

>> You really believe that the
creative spirit ranges on its

own out there beyond boundaries.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do.

00:29:03.238 --> 00:29:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Something of the hero.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.032 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean to suggest that
you see yourself as a hero--

00:29:07.032 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I don't, but I
see myself as a maverick.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So perhaps the hero lurks
in each one of us when we

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:14.510 align:middle line:90%
don't know it.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our life
evokes our character

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and you find out more about
yourself as you go on.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's very nice to
be able to put yourself

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.720 align:middle line:84%
in situations that will evoke
your higher nature rather

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.633 align:middle line:90%
than your lower.

00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Give me an example.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I can give you a story.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm dealing with an
Iroquois story right now.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's a motif that comes
in American Indian stories very

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.890 align:middle line:84%
often, what I call the
refusal of suitors.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.180 align:middle line:90%
[FLUTE MUSIC]

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.630 align:middle line:84%
A girl with her mother
lived in a wigwam

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
on the edge of the village.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
She was a very handsome
girl, but extremely proud

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and would not accept
any of the boys.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:58.010 align:middle line:84%
They proposed to her
through the mother.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And the mother was
terribly annoyed with her.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day, they're
out collecting wood,

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and they have gone a long
way from the village.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And while they are
collecting the wood,

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.110 align:middle line:84%
a terrific darkness
comes over them.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, this wasn't the
darkness of night descending.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
darkness like that,

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
there's some magician
at work somewhere.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So the mother says, well,
let's gather some bark

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and make a little wigwam, a
bark wigwam for ourselves,

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and collect wood for
a fire, and we'll just

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.020 align:middle line:90%
spend the night here.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So they do that, and
the mother falls asleep.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And the girl looks, and there's
this magnificent guy standing

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.340 align:middle line:84%
there with a wampum sash,
glorious feathers and all

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.440 align:middle line:90%
this kind-- black feathers.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.490 align:middle line:84%
He says, I've come to marry
you and I'll await your reply.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
She accepts the guy and
the mother accepts the man,

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and he gives the
mother the wampum belt

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to prove that he's
serious about all this.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:90%
So he goes away with the girl.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:90%
She has acquiesced.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.213 align:middle line:84%
Mere human beings weren't
good enough for her,

00:31:13.213 --> 00:31:14.630 align:middle line:84%
but here's something
that really--

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.030 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.600 align:middle line:90%
So she's in another domain.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, the adventure is marvelous.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:28.028 align:middle line:84%
She goes with him to his village
and they enter his lodge.

00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
The people in there greet
her, and she feels very

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:90%
comfortable about it and all.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the next day he
says, I'm going off to hunt.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So he leaves the lodge and the
door is closed with a flap.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:42.760 align:middle line:90%
There's a flap.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
When he closes the flap,
she hears a strange sound.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.480 align:middle line:90%
So there's the whole day.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And she's just in the hut.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And as evening comes, she
hears that strange sound again.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the door flap is
flung off, and in comes

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:84%
this prodigious serpent
with his tongue darting.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And he puts his head
in her lap and says,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.030 align:middle line:84%
now, you must search my head
for lice and things like that.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And she finds all kinds
of horrible things there,

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:90%
kills them all.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And then he withdraws, and
in a moment after the gate--

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
door has been closed, it
opens again and in he comes--

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.860 align:middle line:84%
it's the same beautiful
young man again.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And said, were you afraid of
me when I came in just now?

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
She says she wasn't
at all afraid.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Next day, he goes off to hunt.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And then she leaves the
lodge to gather wood,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:43.030 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing she
sees is an enormous serpent

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:48.070 align:middle line:84%
basking on the rocks, and then
another, and then another.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And she begins to feel
very badly, very homesick

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and discouraged.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Then the evening, the serpent,
and then the man again.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The third day when
he leaves, she

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:84%
decides she's going to try
to get out of this place.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So she goes out and she's
standing in the woods,

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And a voice speaks to her,
and she turns, and there's

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.740 align:middle line:90%
a little old man there.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says, darling,
you are in trouble.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:84%
The man that you've married
is one of seven brothers.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:90%
They are great magicians.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And like many
people of this kind,

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:84%
their hearts are
not in their bodies.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a collection
of seven hearts

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.660 align:middle line:84%
in a bag that is hidden under
the bed of the eldest to whom

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:90%
you are married.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.080 align:middle line:84%
You must go get
that, and then we'll

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.080 align:middle line:84%
deal with the next
part of the adventure.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:84%
She goes in, finds the bag of
hearts, and is running out.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And a voice calls
after her, stop, stop.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the voice of the magician.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.940 align:middle line:90%
And she continues to run.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:84%
He says, you may think
you can get away from me,

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.870 align:middle line:90%
but you never can.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And just at that point, she
hears the voice of the old man.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'll help you, dear.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's pulling her
out of the water.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:84%
She didn't even know
that she was in water.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that say to you?

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:84%
>> That's to say you have
moved out of the heart land,

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
the solid Earth, and in the
field of the unconscious.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And she had pulled herself
into the transcendent realm

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and got caught in the
negative powers of the abyss,

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and she's being rescued
down by the upper powers.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:37.360 align:middle line:84%
What you have done has been
to elevate yourself out

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
of the local field
and put yourself

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in the field of higher
power, higher danger.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.969 align:middle line:84%
And are you going to
be able to handle it?

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.320 align:middle line:84%
If you are not eligible for
this place into which you

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.280 align:middle line:84%
put yourself, it's going
to be a demon marriage.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a real mess.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are eligible,
it can be a glory

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that will give you a life
that is yours in your own way.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So these stories of mythology
are simply trying to express

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
a truth that can't be
grasped any other way.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the edge, the interface
between what can be known

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and what is never to be
discovered because it is

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.200 align:middle line:84%
a mystery transcendent
of all human research,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.285 align:middle line:90%
the source of life.

00:35:28.285 --> 00:35:29.620 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.420 align:middle line:90%
No one knows.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are stories important
for getting at that?

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's important
to live life with a knowledge

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of its mystery and
of your own mystery.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And it gives life a new zest,
a new balance, a new harmony

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.390 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Therapy and
psychological therapy,

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:84%
when people find out what it
is that's ticking in them,

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.450 align:middle line:90%
they get straightened out.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:90%
And what is it that life is?

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I find thinking in
mythological terms

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.200 align:middle line:90%
is how people are visibly.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.480 align:middle line:90%
You can see it happen.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> How?

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.875 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It erases anxieties.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It puts them in accord with
the inevitables of their life.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can see the
positive values of what--

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.430 align:middle line:84%
or the negative aspects
of what is positive.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It's whether you're going to
say no to the serpent or yes

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.570 align:middle line:90%
to the serpent.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:90%
As easy as that.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No to the adventure?

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:84%
The adventure of being
alive, of living.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was growing
up, tales of King Arthur,

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:84%
tales of the medieval knights,
tales of the dragon slayers

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:90%
were very strong in my world.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Dragons represent
greed, really.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The European dragon guards
things in this cave,

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and what he guards are
heaps of gold and virgins.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And he can't make use of either
of them, but he just guards.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.800 align:middle line:84%
There's no vitality
of experience

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:84%
either of the value of the
gold or of the female whom

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.620 align:middle line:90%
he's guarding there.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Psychologically, the
dragon is one's own finding

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.790 align:middle line:84%
of one's self to one's
ego, and you're captured

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:38.920 align:middle line:90%
in your own dragon cage.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And the parameter
of the psychiatrist

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.430 align:middle line:84%
is to break that
dragon, open him

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
up so that you can have a
larger field of relationships.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Hume had a patient come
to him who felt alone,

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and she drew a picture of
herself as caught in the rocks.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.740 align:middle line:84%
From the waist down,
she was bound in rocks.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And this was on a windy
shore, and the wind blowing

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:90%
and her hair blowing.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And all the gold which is the
sign of the vitality of life

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.250 align:middle line:90%
was locked in the rocks.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And the next picture
that he had her draw

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:25.750 align:middle line:84%
had followed something
he had said to her.

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, a lightning flash
hit the rocks and the gold

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.730 align:middle line:90%
came pouring out.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And then she found reflected
on rocks round about the gold.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was no more
gold in the rocks.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:43.000 align:middle line:90%
It was all available on the top.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the conferences that
followed, those patches of gold

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:90%
were identified.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:90%
They were her friends.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.860 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't alone.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But she had locked herself in
her own little room and life,

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.540 align:middle line:90%
but she had friends.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I mean?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:90%
This is killing the dragon.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And you have fears and things.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.940 align:middle line:90%
This is the dragon.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
that's all about, at least

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.830 align:middle line:90%
the European dragon.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Chinese dragon is different.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.185 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:39:20.185 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It represents the
vitality of the swamps.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And the dragon comes out,
beating his belly and saying,

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.160 align:middle line:90%
ha ha, ha, ha.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:28.960 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.030 align:middle line:90%
That's another kind of dragon.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one that yields
the bounty and the waters

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of thing.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.330 align:middle line:90%
He's the great, glorious thing.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.427 align:middle line:84%
But this is the negative
one that cuts it out.

00:39:40.427 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying is
if there are not dragons out

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.410 align:middle line:90%
there, then there may not be--

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.827 align:middle line:90%
>> The real dragon is in you.

00:39:46.827 --> 00:39:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is that real dragon?

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's your ego,
holding you in.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> What's my ego?

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What I want, what I
believe, what I can do,

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.240 align:middle line:84%
what I think I
love, and all that.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.690 align:middle line:84%
What I regard as the aim
of my life, and so forth.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It might be too small.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It might be that
which pins you down.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And if it's simply
that of doing what

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.950 align:middle line:84%
the environment tells
you to do, it certainly

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:90%
is pinning you down.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the environment
is your dragon

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.530 align:middle line:90%
as it reflects within yourself.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> How do I slay?

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you--

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Slay that dragon in me?

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:84%
What's the journey
I have to make?

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:29.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to make?

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Each of us has to make?

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:84%
You talk about something called
the soul's high adventure.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> My general formula for my
students is follow your bliss.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, find where it is and
don't be afraid to follow it.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Can my bliss be my life's
love or my life's work?

00:40:47.365 --> 00:40:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it my work or my life?

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if the work that you're
doing is the work that you

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.940 align:middle line:84%
chose to do because you
are enjoying it, that's it.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you think oh, gee, I
couldn't do that, you know,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that's your dragon
locking you in.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.210 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't be a writer.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do what
so-and-so is doing.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Unlike the classical heroes,
we're not going on our journey

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to save the world,
but to save ourselves.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And in doing that,
you save the world.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you do.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The influence of a
vital person vitalizes.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.400 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about it.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.590 align:middle line:90%
The world is a wasteland.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:31.600 align:middle line:84%
People have the notion of saving
the world by shifting it around

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and changing the
rules, and so forth.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And no.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Any world is a living
world if it's alive.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is to
bring it to life.

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And the way to bring it to life
is to find in your own case

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.910 align:middle line:84%
where your life is and be
alive yourself, it seems to me.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the power of
the teacher, isn't it?

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.080 align:middle line:84%
To bring vitality to
others, to make others

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.430 align:middle line:90%
see the vitality in them.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it happens.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
delights of teaching.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're not teaching
in order to have an easy job,

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
but because you really
have something to teach,

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and you love young
people, and you

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:90%
want to give what you've got--

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:90%
found to them.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And to see them come alive
is the reward of teaching.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> But you say I have to take
that journey and go down there

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.380 align:middle line:90%
and slay those dragons.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Do I have to go alone?

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have someone who
can help you, that's fine too.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.250 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, the last
trick has to be done by you.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In all of these
journeys of mythology,

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
there's a place
everyone wishes to find.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:90%
The Buddhists talk of nirvana.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Jesus talks of peace.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a place of
rest and repose.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Is that typical of
the hero's journey,

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.640 align:middle line:90%
that there's a place to find?

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a place
in yourself of rest.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Now this, I know a little
bit about from athletics.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
The athlete who is
in championship form

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:09.585 align:middle line:84%
has a quiet place in
himself, and it's out of that

00:43:09.585 --> 00:43:12.360 align:middle line:90%
that his action comes.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:18.450 align:middle line:84%
If he's all in the action field,
he's not performing properly.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a center out
of which you act.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And Jean, my wife,
a dancer, tells me

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.925 align:middle line:90%
that in dance this is true too.

00:43:26.925 --> 00:43:30.600 align:middle line:84%
There's the center that
has to be known and held.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.760 align:middle line:84%
There it's quite physically
recognized by the person.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But unless this center has
been found, you're torn apart.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Tension comes.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.530 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Buddha's
word is nirvana.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Nirvana is a psychological
state of mind.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not a place like heaven.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that's not here.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:02.300 align:middle line:84%
It is here in the middle
of the turmoil, what's

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.620 align:middle line:84%
called samsara, the
whirlpool of life conditions.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.330 align:middle line:90%
That nirvana is what?

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It is the condition that
comes when you are not

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:20.450 align:middle line:84%
compelled by desire or by
fear or by social commitments.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:84%
When you hold your center
and act out of there.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And like all heroes,
the Buddha doesn't show you

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.990 align:middle line:90%
the truth, the illumination.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:90%
He shows you the way to--

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> The way.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.370 align:middle line:90%
But it's got to be your way too.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how should
I get rid of fear?

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha can't tell me
how I'm going to do it.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.390 align:middle line:84%
There are exercises that
different teachers will

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.760 align:middle line:84%
give you, but they
may not work for you.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And all the teacher
can do is give you

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.970 align:middle line:90%
a clue of the direction.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.120 align:middle line:84%
He's like a lighthouse that
says, there are rocks over here

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.250 align:middle line:90%
and steer clear.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk a lot
about consciousness.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people hear that term
and like me have only a veiled

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:90%
understanding of it.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Jean and I are
living in Hawaii,

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're living
right by the ocean.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And we have a little
lanai, a little porch.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's a coconut tree
that grows up through the porch

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and it goes on up.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a kind of vine
plant, a big powerful thing

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:34.460 align:middle line:84%
with leaves like this that
has grown up the coconut tree.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:39.455 align:middle line:84%
Now, that plant sends forth
little feelers to go out

00:45:39.455 --> 00:45:41.090 align:middle line:90%
and clutch the plant.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And it knows where the
plant is and what to do

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.190 align:middle line:90%
and where the tree is.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And it grows up like
this, and it opens a leaf.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And that leaf immediately
turns to where the sun is.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't tell me
that leaf doesn't know

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:90%
where the sun is going to be.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.930 align:middle line:84%
All of the leaves
go just like that,

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:84%
what's called
heliotropism, turning

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.290 align:middle line:90%
toward where the sun is.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a form of consciousness.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.750 align:middle line:90%
There is a plant consciousness.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There is an animal
consciousness.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.210 align:middle line:90%
We share all of these things.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You eat certain
foods and the bile

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.970 align:middle line:84%
knows whether there's something
there for it to go to work on.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this whole
thing is consciousness.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I begin to feel more and
more that the whole world is

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.520 align:middle line:90%
conscious.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the vegetable
world is conscious.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you live in the
woods as I did as a kid,

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:84%
you can see all these
different consciousnesses

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.410 align:middle line:90%
relating to themselves.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is a part of the
sort of Cartesian mode

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to think of consciousness
as being something

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.590 align:middle line:84%
peculiar to the head, that
this is the organ originating

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:52.610 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:53.690 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an organ that
inflects consciousness

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:00.080 align:middle line:84%
to a certain direction, a
certain set of purposes.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole
consciousness here in the body,

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and the whole living world
is informed by consciousness.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a feeling that
consciousness and energy

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.470 align:middle line:90%
are the same thing somehow.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Where you really see energy,
there is consciousness.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists are beginning
to talk quite openly about

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.320 align:middle line:90%
the Gaia principle.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You want the whole
planet as an organism.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mother Earth.

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And you see, if you will
think of ourselves as coming

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.050 align:middle line:84%
out of the Earth rather than
as being thrown in here from

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:40.080 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else, you know,
thrown out of the Earth,

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.370 align:middle line:90%
we are the Earth.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.100 align:middle line:84%
We are the consciousness
of the Earth.

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:84%
These are the eyes
of the Earth and this

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:90%
is the voice of the Earth.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:52.020 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we raise
our consciousness?

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a matter of
what you are supposed to think

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
meditations are for.

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And all of life is a meditation,
most of it unintentional.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people spend
most of it in meditating

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:12.330 align:middle line:84%
on where their
money's coming from

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and where it's going to go, but
that's a level of meditation.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Or if you have a
family to bring up,

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.240 align:middle line:90%
your concern for the family.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.110 align:middle line:90%
These are all perfectly--

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.090 align:middle line:84%
very important
concerns, but they

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:29.730 align:middle line:84%
have to do with physical
conditions mostly

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual conditions
of the children, of course.

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But how are you
going to communicate

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.360 align:middle line:84%
spiritual consciousness
to the children

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.700 align:middle line:90%
if you don't have it yourself?

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.120 align:middle line:90%
So how do you get that?

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Then you think about the myths.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.980 align:middle line:84%
What the myths are
for is to bring us

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:84%
into a level of consciousness
that is spiritual.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Just for example, I walk off
52nd Street and Fifth Avenue

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:56.190 align:middle line:90%
into St. Patrick's Cathedral.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I've left a very busy
city, and one of the most

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.050 align:middle line:84%
fiercely economically
inspired cities on the planet.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I walk into that cathedral,
and everything around me

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.960 align:middle line:90%
speaks of spiritual mystery.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.370 align:middle line:90%
The mystery of the cross.

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.900 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about there?

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:22.430 align:middle line:84%
The stained glass windows which
bring another atmosphere in.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.850 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness has been
brought up onto another level

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:31.070 align:middle line:84%
altogether, and I am on
a different platform.

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I walk out
and [TONGUE CLICK]

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm back in this one again.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, can I hold
something from that?

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, certain prayers
or meditations that

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.860 align:middle line:84%
are associated with the
whole context there,

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.390 align:middle line:84%
these are what
are called mantras

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:49.910 align:middle line:84%
in India, little
meditation themes that

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.250 align:middle line:84%
hold your consciousness
on that level

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.950 align:middle line:84%
instead of letting it drop
down here all the way.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And then what you
can finally do is

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:01.184 align:middle line:84%
recognize that this is
simply a lower level of that.

00:50:01.184 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:90%
[CHURCH BELLS]

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The cathedral at Chartres
which you love so much also

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:84%
expresses a relationship
of the human to the cosmos,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think everyone who
has spent any time at Chartres

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.090 align:middle line:84%
has felt something very
special about this cathedral.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I've been there
about eight times.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.150 align:middle line:84%
When I was a student
in Paris, I went down

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:31.180 align:middle line:84%
there about five times and
spent one whole weekend

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and identified and looked
at every single figure

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.465 align:middle line:90%
in that cathedral.

00:50:37.465 --> 00:50:41.080 align:middle line:90%
[CHOIR SINGING]

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.635 align:middle line:84%
I was there so much that
the concierge, this little

00:50:44.635 --> 00:50:47.710 align:middle line:84%
old fellow who took
care of the cathedral,

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:50.930 align:middle line:84%
he came to me one
noon time and he said,

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:54.760 align:middle line:84%
would you like to go up
with me and ring the bells?

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.190 align:middle line:90%
I said, I sure would.

00:50:57.190 --> 00:51:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So we climbed the
flitch, the tower up

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to where the great bell was,
the great enormous bronze bell.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And there was a little--

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:90%
like a seesaw.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And he stood on one
end of the seesaw

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and I stood on the
other end of the seesaw,

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and there was a little bar
there for us to hold on to.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.550 align:middle line:84%
He gave the thing a push,
and then he was on it

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and I was on it.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.030 align:middle line:84%
We started going up
and down, and the wind

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:31.210 align:middle line:84%
blowing through our hair
up there in the cathedral.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.340 align:middle line:90%
And then it began underneath.

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Bong!

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.290 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Bong, bong.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.113 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, it was one
of the most thrilling

00:51:38.113 --> 00:51:39.590 align:middle line:90%
adventures of my life.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And when it was all
over, he brought me down.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:47.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to show
you where my room is.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a cathedral, you
have the nave and then

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:54.760 align:middle line:90%
the transept and then the apse.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And around the apse
is the choir screen.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the choir screen in
Chartres is about that wide.

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And he took me in a little door
into the middle of the choir

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.940 align:middle line:84%
screen, and there was his
little bed and a little table

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.480 align:middle line:90%
with a lamp on it.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked out, there was
the Black Madonna, the vitrine,

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:23.605 align:middle line:84%
the window of the Black Madonna,
and that was where he lived.

00:52:23.605 --> 00:52:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a man
living in a meditation,

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.660 align:middle line:90%
a constant meditation.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was a very
moving, beautiful thing.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been there
time and time again since.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you find
when you go there?

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.320 align:middle line:84%
What does it say about all
that we've been discussing?

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing it says
is it takes me back to a time

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.190 align:middle line:84%
when these principles
informed the society.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can tell
what's in foreign society

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.080 align:middle line:90%
by the size of--

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:84%
what the building is that's the
tallest building in the place.

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:59.470 align:middle line:84%
When you approach
a medieval town,

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.140 align:middle line:84%
the cathedral's the
tallest thing in the place.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:05.530 align:middle line:84%
When you approach a
17th century city,

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:09.200 align:middle line:84%
it's the political palace that's
the tallest thing in the place.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you approach
a modern city,

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.690 align:middle line:84%
it's office buildings
and dwellings

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that are the tallest
things in the place.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to Salt
Lake City, you'll

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.000 align:middle line:84%
see the whole thing illustrated
right in front of your face.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.910 align:middle line:84%
First, the temple
was built. The temple

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.980 align:middle line:84%
was built right in the
center of the city.

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, this was
the proper organization.

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the spiritual
center from which

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.680 align:middle line:90%
all flows in all directions.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the capitol was
built right beside the temple,

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.140 align:middle line:90%
and it's bigger than the temple.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.780 align:middle line:10%
And now the biggest thing
is the office building

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.330 align:middle line:10%
that takes care of the
affairs of both the temple

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.500 align:middle line:10%
and the political building.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the history of
Western civilization

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:50.530 align:middle line:84%
from the Gothic through
the princely periods

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:53.350 align:middle line:84%
of the 16th, 17th,
18th centuries

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:57.010 align:middle line:84%
to this economic world
that we're in now.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:00.365 align:middle line:84%
>> In New York now, the
debate is over who can build

00:54:00.365 --> 00:54:01.240 align:middle line:90%
the tallest building.

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Not to praise, but to
build the tallest building.

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.470 align:middle line:90%
And they are magnificent.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of the things that
are going up in New York now

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:11.890 align:middle line:90%
really are.

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is a kind of
architectural triumph.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is the
statement of the city.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:24.880 align:middle line:84%
We are a financial power
center, and look what we can do.

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of
virtuosic acrobatic stunt.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Will new myths
come from there?

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's something might.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:34.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't predict
what a myth is going

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to be any more than
you can predict what

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.410 align:middle line:90%
you're going to dream tonight.

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Myths and dreams come
from the same place.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:45.280 align:middle line:84%
They come from realizations
of some kind that

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:84%
have then to find
expression in symbolic form.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And the myth-- the only myth
that's going to be worth

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:84%
thinking about in
the immediate future

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.920 align:middle line:84%
is one that's talking
about the planet.

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Not the city, not these people,
but the planet and everybody

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:05.220 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:12.100 align:middle line:84%
That's my main thought for what
the future myth is going to be.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And what it will have
to deal with will

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:84%
be exactly what all myths have
deal with-- have dealt with.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.120 align:middle line:84%
The maturation of the
individual, the gradual--

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.860 align:middle line:84%
the pedagogical way to
follow from dependency

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:31.080 align:middle line:84%
through adulthood to maturity,
and then to the exit,

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.220 align:middle line:90%
and how to do it.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And then how to relate
to this society,

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and how to relate this
society to the world of nature

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:40.830 align:middle line:90%
and the cosmos.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:43.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what the myths
have all talked about.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what this one's
got to talk about.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But the society that
it's going to talk about

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:49.440 align:middle line:90%
is the society of the planet.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And until that gets going,
you don't have anything.

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There's that wonderful
photograph you have

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth seen from space.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's very small, and at
the same time it's very grand.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:09.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't see any divisions
there of nations or states

00:56:09.810 --> 00:56:11.770 align:middle line:90%
or anything of the kind.

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:13.620 align:middle line:84%
This might be the
symbol, really,

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.890 align:middle line:90%
for the new mythology to come.

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:20.760 align:middle line:84%
That is the country that we
are going to be celebrating,

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and those are the people
that we are one with.
