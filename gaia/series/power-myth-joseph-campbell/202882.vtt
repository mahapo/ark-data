unseen power no longer serve

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010 align:middle line:84%
as in primeval times to

Bears, lions,

Man is no longer the newcomer
in a world of unexplored plains

and forests.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And our immediate
neighbors are not

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
wild beasts, but
other human beings,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
contending for goods and
space on a planet that

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
is whirling without end around
the fire ball of a star.

Neither in body
nor in mind do we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
inhabit the world
of those hunting

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.060 align:middle line:84%
races of the
Paleolithic millennia,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:84%
to whose lives and life
ways we, nevertheless,

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.345 align:middle line:84%
owe the very forms of our bodies
and structures of our minds.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Memories of their
animal envoys still

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
must sleep somehow within
us, for they wake a little

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and stir when we
venture into wilderness.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
They wake in terror to
thunder, and again, they

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
wake with a sense
of recognition when

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
we enter any one of those
great, painted caves.

Whatever the inward
darkness may have been,

to which the shamans
of those caves

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:84%
descended in their
trances, the same

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
must lie within ourselves,
nightly visited in sleep.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Listening to Joseph Campbell
describe those ancient cave

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
paintings, I found myself
understanding for the first

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.250 align:middle line:84%
time how profoundly human it is
to contemplate our mortality.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Animals obviously
experience death, too.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:90%
They watch each other die.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But as far as we know, they
don't imagine something

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
beyond death.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere around
250,000 to 50,000 BC,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
our earliest ancestors left
us the first tangible evidence

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
of mythological thinking.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
They buried their dead as if
they were going somewhere.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of food, tools,
and sacrificial animals

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
has been found in
those burial caves,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
as if to wish the
dead bon voyage.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Neanderthal man
also seems to have

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
thought that some godly
beings from another world

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
like to drop in for a
visit, disguised as animals.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Primitive humans
depended on those vistas

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:90%
for food and clothing.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But after killing them,
either from gratitude

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:84%
for their sacrifice or
guilt over their murder,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:84%
the hunters appear to have
prepared them for the trip

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.010 align:middle line:90%
back home.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
High mountain caves
have been found

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
with bear skulls preserved
ceremoniously and placed

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:90%
in symbolic settings.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
These early humans
were obviously

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:84%
disposed to the possibility
of another plane of existence,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:84%
one they had to reckon with
because their lives were bound

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to it in some mysterious
essential way.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.370 align:middle line:90%
The very idea gave them hope.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this difficult
hardscrabble life

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.290 align:middle line:90%
is not all there is.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They also had to do
some serious thinking.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
How do we get ready
for the next one?

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
They began to devise
stories to bridge

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
the gulf between
what they could see

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
and what they could
only imagine--

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
our first myths perhaps about
this world and the world

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell was fascinated
with these first storytellers.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Their mythic stories
were not simply

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
entertaining tales to
be told for amusement

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:90%
around the campfire.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
They were powerful guides
to the life of the spirit.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Myths helped our
ancestors explain

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the
sun across the sky,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:84%
the changing of the seasons,
even the mystery of creation.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Through the
millennia, they became

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
what he called
"the wonderful song

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:90%
of the soul's high adventure."

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
In this conversation,
one of the many I taped

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
with Joseph Campbell at
George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.720 align:middle line:84%
during the last two
years of his life,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.670 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
these first stories

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.710 align:middle line:90%
and the people who told them.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Like them, we, too, have to come
to terms with our immortality

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and anticipate our
destiny with death.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
What do you think our souls
owed to ancient myths?

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the ancient myths
were designed to put the mind,

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
the mental system, into
accord with this body system,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:90%
with this inheritance--

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> A harmony?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> --up in the
body-- to harmonize.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The mind can ramble
off in strange ways

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and want things that
the body does not want.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And the myths and
rites were means

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to put the mind in
accord with the body

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and the way of life
in accord with the way

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:90%
that nature dictates.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So, in a way, these
old stories live in us.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> They do indeed.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And the stages of
a human development

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
are the same today as they
were in the ancient times.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And the problem of
a child brought up

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
in a world of
discipline, of obedience,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and of his dependency
on others has

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to be transcended when one
comes to maturity so that you

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:84%
are living now not in
dependency, but with self,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
responsible authority and
the problem of the transition

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:90%
from childhood to maturity.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And then for maturity and full
capacity to losing those powers

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and acquiescing in the natural
course of, you might say,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
the autumn time of life
and the passage away,

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
myths are there to help us go
with it, accept nature's way,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:90%
and not hold to something else.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The stories are
sort of, to me,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
like messages in a bottle from
a shore someone else has visited

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and you're
visiting those shores now.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And these myths tell me how
others have made the passage

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:90%
and how I can make the passage.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And also what the
beauties are of the way.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel this now moving into
my own last years, you know?

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.355 align:middle line:84%
The myths helped
me to go with it.

00:07:17.355 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of myth?

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Give me one that has
actually helped you.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the tradition
in India, for instance,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
of actually changing
your whole way of dress,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
even changing your name as you
pass from one stage to another.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
When I retired from
teaching, I knew

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that I had to create a new
life, a new way of life.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I changed my manner
of thinking about my life,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of that
notion, moving out

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere of achievement
into the sphere of enjoyment

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation and relaxing
into the wonder of it all.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there is that final
passage through the dark gate.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
no problem at all.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.630 align:middle line:84%
The problem in
mid-life when the body

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
has reached its climax of
power and begins to lose it

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is to identify yourself
not with the body, which

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
is falling away, but with
the consciousness of which it

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:90%
is a vehicle.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you can do that--
and this is something

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:90%
I've learned from my myths.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Am I the bulb that
carries the light,

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:84%
or am I the light of which
the bulb is a vehicle?

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And this body is a
vehicle of consciousness.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you can identify
with the consciousness,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
you can watch this thing
go like an old car.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:90%
There goes the fender.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:90%
There goes this.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
But it's expectable, you know?

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, gradually, the
whole thing drops off,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
rejoins consciousness.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's no longer in
this particular environment.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And the myths, the
stories have brought this

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I live
with these myths.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And they tell me to
do this all the time.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is the problem
which can be then

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
metaphorically
understood as identifying

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:90%
with the Christ in you.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And the Christ in
you doesn't die.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
The Christ in you survives
death and resurrects.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.685 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be Shiva.

00:09:31.685 --> 00:09:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Shiva Dhun, I am Shiva.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is the great meditation
of the yogis in the Himalayas.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And one doesn't have even
to have a metaphorical image

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
like that, if one
has a mind that's

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
willing to just relax
and identify itself

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:90%
with that which moves it.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You say that the image
of death is the beginning

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.600 align:middle line:90%
of mythology.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, all I can say to that
is that the earliest evidence

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
we have of anything like
mythological thinking is

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:90%
associated with grave burials.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And they suggest, what,
that men, women saw life,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and then they didn't see it
and they wondered about it?

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It must have been--

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one has
only to imagine what

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:90%
one's own experience would be.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.095 align:middle line:84%
The person was alive and warm
before you and talking to you,

00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
is now lying there, getting
cold, beginning to rot.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Something was there that
isn't there, and where is it?

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, animals have
this experience

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
certainly of their companions
dying and so forth.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But there's no evidence
that they've had

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:90%
any further thoughts about it.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Also, before the time
of Neanderthal man,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
it's in his period that
the first burials appear

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:90%
of which we have evidence.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
People would die, and
they're just thrown away.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:90%
But here, there's is a concern.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever visited
any of these burial sites?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been to [NON-ENGLISH].

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the earliest
burial caves that were found.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And you find there what
they buried with the dead?

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
These grave burials
with grave gear--

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that is to say,
weapons and sacrifices

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
roundabout-- certainly suggest
the idea of the continued life

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:90%
beyond the visible one.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:84%
First one was discovered,
person was put down,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:90%
resting as though asleep--

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
a young boy with a beautiful
hand axe beside him.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the same
time, we have evidence

00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
of shrines devoted to animals
that have been killed--

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
the shrine specifically in
the Alps in very high caves.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are of
cave bear skulls.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is one
very interesting one

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
with the long bones of the cave
bear in the cave bear's jaw.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that say to you?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Burials, my friend
has died and he survives.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
The animals that I've
killed must also survive.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I must make some kind of
atonement relationship to them.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The indication is of the
notion of a plane of being this

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
behind the visible plane,
and which is somehow

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.980 align:middle line:84%
supportive of the visible one,
to which we have to relate.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I would say that's the basic
theme of all mythology--

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That there is a world?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That there is an invisible
plane supporting the visible

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:84%
one, whether it is thought of as
a world or simply as an energy

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that differs from time and
time and place to place.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What we don't know
supports what we do know.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.560 align:middle line:84%
The basic hunting
myth, I would say,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:84%
is of a kind of covenant
between the animal

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:84%
world and the human
world, where the animal

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:90%
gives its life willingly.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
They are regarded generally
as willing victims

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
with the understanding
that their life, which

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:84%
transcends their
physical entity,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.310 align:middle line:84%
will be returned to the
soil or to the mother

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
through some ritual
of restoration.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And the principal
rituals, for instance,

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and the principal
divinities are associated

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:90%
with the main hunting animal--

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
the animal who is
the master animal

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and sends the flocks
to be killed, you know?

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The Indians of the American
plains, it was the buffalo.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
You go to the northwest
coast, it's the salmon.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:84%
The great festivals have to
do with the run of salmon

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.180 align:middle line:90%
coming in.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.030 align:middle line:84%
When you go to South
Africa, the elands,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
the big magnificent antelope,
is the principal animal

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
for the bushmen, for example.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And the principal animal--

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the one that
furnishes the food.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The food, so there grew
up between human beings

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and animals a
bonding, as you say,

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
which required one to be
consumed by the other.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the way life is.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.445 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think this
troubled early man,

00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:49.445 align:middle line:90%
that he felt some guilt?

00:14:49.445 --> 00:14:50.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:50.245 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have the rites
because it did trouble him.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of rites?

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Rituals of appeasement
to the animals,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:90%
of thanks to the animal.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.436 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> A very interesting
aspect here is the identity

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.998 align:middle line:90%
of the hunter with the animal.

00:15:07.998 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean after the
animal has been shot.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>> After the animal
has been killed.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:84%
The hunter then has to
fulfill certain rites

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of participation
mystique, a mystique

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:84%
participation with the
animals whose deaths he

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:84%
has brought about and whose
meat is to become his life.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So the killing is
not simply slaughter.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:90%
At any rate, it's a ritual act.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a recognition
of your dependency

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and of the voluntary
giving of this food to you

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:90%
by the animal who has given it.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
It turns life into a
mythological experience.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> The hunt becomes what?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It becomes a ritual.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:90%
The hunt is a ritual.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Expressing a hope
of resurrection,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:84%

and--

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And some kind of respect
for the animal that was killed.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing that gets me

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:06.847 align:middle line:90%
>> Respect the animal.

00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The respect for the
animal-- and more than respect.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that animal becomes
a messenger of divine power,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And you wind up, as the
hunter, killing the messenger.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Killing the god.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> What does this do?

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Does it cause guilt?

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Does it cause--

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Guilt is what is
wiped out by the myth.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:90%
It is not a personal act.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:84%

the bear.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
When it is killed,
there is a ceremony

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
of feeding the bear a
feast of its own flesh,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
He's served his own
meat for dinner.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:90%
of worship?

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Of power superior to man.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And the animal was superior
because the animal provided

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now, in contrast to
our relationship to animals,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
where we see animals as
the lower form of life,

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and in the Bible, we're told
we're the masters and so forth.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Early hunting people don't
have that relationship

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:90%
to the animal.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The animal is, in
many ways, superior.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:84%
He has powers that the
human being doesn't have.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And then certain animals
take on a persona, don't they?

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:84%
The buffalo, the
raven, the eagle?

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, very strongly.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was up in the
northwest coast back

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:90%
in 1932, a wonderful trip.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Indians along the way
were still carving totem poles.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
The villagers had new
totem poles still.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And there we saw the ravens,
and we saw the eagles,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and we saw the animals that
played roles in the myths.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And they had the character,
the quality of these animals.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
They had a very
intimate knowledge

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:84%
and friendly,
neighborly relationship

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%
to these creatures.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, they killed
some of them, you see.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.886 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.886 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The animal had something
to do with the shaping

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
of the myths of
those people, just

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
as the buffalo for the
Indians of the Plains

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.840 align:middle line:90%
played an enormous role.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.605 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that bring the
tobacco gift, the mystical pipe

00:19:18.605 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of thing.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:90%
It comes from a buffalo.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And when the animal becomes the
giver of a ritual and so forth,

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
they do ask the
animal for advice,

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and the animal becomes
the model for how to live.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You remember the story
of the buffalo's wife?

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> That is a basic legend
of the Blackfoot tribe.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's the origin legend of
their buffalo dance rituals--

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Which had--

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --by which they invoke the
cooperation of the animals

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:90%
in this play of life.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
When you realize the size of
some of these tribal groups,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
to feed them required
a good deal of meat.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And one way of acquiring
meat for the winter

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:84%
would be to drive a
buffalo herd to stampede it

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.315 align:middle line:90%
over a rock cliff.

00:20:11.315 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, this story is of a
Blackfoot tribe long, long ago.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't get the
buffalo to go over the cliff.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.002 align:middle line:84%
The buffalo would approach
the cliff and then turn aside.

00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So it looked as
though they weren't

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
going to have any
meat for that winter.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the daughter
of one of the houses,

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:84%
getting up early in
the morning to draw

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:38.980 align:middle line:84%
the water for the family
and so forth, looks up,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and there, right above the
cliff, were the buffalo.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, if
you only come over,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:90%
I'd marry one of you.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And to her surprise, they
all began coming over.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:90%
That was surprise number one.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Surprise number two was
when one of the old buffalo,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
the shaman of the
herd, comes and says,

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:90%
all right, girly, off we go.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, she says.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, he said.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:90%
You made your promise.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.170 align:middle line:84%
We've kept our side
of the bargain.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Look at all my relatives.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:90%
They're dead.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.228 align:middle line:90%
Off we go.

00:21:13.228 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, the family gets up in the
morning and they look around,

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and where's Minnehaha?

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.723 align:middle line:84%
And the father--
and you know how

00:21:19.723 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Indians are-- he
looked around, he said,

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:90%
she's run off with a buffalo.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:90%
He could see by the footsteps.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So he says, oh, I'm
going to get her back.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So he puts on his walking
moccasins, bow and arrow

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and goes
out over the plains.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
He's gone quite a distance
when he feels that he

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.050 align:middle line:90%
had to sit down and rest.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And he comes to a place that's
called a buffalo wallow, where

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:84%
the buffalo like to come and
roll around and get the lice

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:90%
off and roll around in the mud.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:10%
So he sits down there, and he's
thinking what he should do now,

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.710 align:middle line:10%
when along comes a magpie.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's a beautiful,
flashing bird.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
those clever birds

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.325 align:middle line:90%
that has shamanic qualities.

00:22:02.325 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Magical qualities.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Magical, and the man says
to him, oh, beautiful bird.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, my daughter
ran away with a buffalo.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen--
will you hang around

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and see if you can find her
out on the plains somewhere?

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And the magpie
says, well, there's

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.140 align:middle line:84%
a lovely girl with the buffaloes
right now over there, just

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:90%
a bit away.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, said the man,
would you go tell her

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that her daddy's here,
her father's here

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:90%
at the buffalo wallow?

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.585 align:middle line:84%
The magpie flies
over, and the girl

00:22:32.585 --> 00:22:33.710 align:middle line:90%
is there among the buffalo.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:90%
They're all asleep.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what she's
doing, knitting or something

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:90%
of this kind.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:10%
And the magpie comes over
close to her, and he says,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:10%
your father's over at the
wallow waiting for you.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she says.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:90%
This is very terrible.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:90%
This is dangerous.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these buffalo,
they'll kill us.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You tell him to wait.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll be over.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to work this out.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So her buffalo
husband's behind her,

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and he wakes up and
takes off a horn.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, go to the wallow
and get me a drink.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.853 align:middle line:84%
So she takes the horn and goes
over, and there's her father.

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And he grabs her by the arm.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
He says, come.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.950 align:middle line:10%
She says, no, no, no,
this is real danger.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:84%
The whole herd, they'll
be right after us.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:90%
I have to work this thing out.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.310 align:middle line:90%
Now let me just go back.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So she gets the
water and goes back.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And he-- fee-fi-fo-fum, I
smell the blood of an Indian,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And she says, no,
nothing of the kind.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:90%
He says, yes, indeed.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So he gives a buffalo
bellow, and they all get up.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And they all do a slow buffalo
dance with their tails raised,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.515 align:middle line:90%
and they go over.

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And they trample that
poor man to death

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.220 align:middle line:90%
so that he disappears entirely.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
He's just all broken up
to pieces and all gone.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
The girl's crying.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And her buffalo husband
says, so you're crying.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
This is my daddy.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah,
but what about us?

00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
They're our children,
our wives, our parents,

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and you're crying
about your daddy?

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, apparently, he was a kind
of sympathetic, compassionate

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.510 align:middle line:90%
buffalo.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
I'll tell you.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:84%
If you can bring your daddy back
to life again, I'll let you go.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.647 align:middle line:84%
So she turns to the
magpie and says, see,

00:24:19.647 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
peck around a
little bit, and see

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:90%
if you can find a bit of daddy.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And the magpie does so,
and he comes up finally

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:84%
with a vertebra,
just one little bone.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And the little girl
said, that's plenty.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, we put this
down on the ground.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And she puts her
blanket over it.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And she sings the revivifying
song, a magical song

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:90%
with great power.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And presently, yes, there's
a man under the blanket.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:90%
She looks.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Daddy, all right, but
he's not breathing yet.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
A few more stanzas of whatever
the song was, and he stands up.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:90%
And the buffalo are amazed.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, why
don't you do this for us?

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:84%
We'll teach you now
our buffalo dance.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you will have killed
our families, you do this dance

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and sing this song, and we'll
all be back to life again.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the basic idea,
that through the ritual,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that dimension is struck
which transcends temporality,

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and out of which life comes
back into which it goes.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And it goes back to this
whole idea of death, burial,

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and resurrection, not only
for human beings, but for--

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> But for the animals, too.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So the story of the buffalo's
wife was told to confirm

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:90%
the reverence.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened when the white
man came and slaughtered this

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:90%
animal of reference?

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a
sacramental violation.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.985 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in the '80s, when the
buffalo hunt was undertaken--

00:25:50.985 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:90%
>> The 1880s, years ago.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> --Kit Carson, Buffalo
Bill, and so forth.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.530 align:middle line:84%
When I was a boy, whenever
we went for sleigh rides,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:90%
we had a buffalo robe.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo
robes all over the place.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
This was a sacred
animal of the Indians.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.660 align:middle line:84%
These hunters go out
with repeating rifles

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and then shoot down the whole
herd and leave it there.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:20.940 align:middle line:84%
They take the skin to sell
and the bodies left to rot.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:90%
This is a sacrilege.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.770 align:middle line:90%
And it really is a sacrilege.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> They turned the
buffalo from a thou--

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.505 align:middle line:90%
>> To an it.

00:26:32.505 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The Indians addressed
the buffalo as thou.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> As a thou.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:35.853 align:middle line:90%
>> An object of reverence.

00:26:35.853 --> 00:26:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The Indians addressed
life as a thou.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, trees, stones,
everything else.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.590 align:middle line:84%
You can address
anything as a thou,

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel the change in
your psychology as you do it.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The ego that sees a thou is not
the same ego that sees an it.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Your whole psychology
changes when

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.160 align:middle line:90%
you address things as an it.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Whether it's a--

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you go to
war with the people,

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
the problem of the newspapers is
to turn those people into its,

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:90%
so that they're not thous.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> That was an incredible moment
in the evolution of American

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:84%
society, when the
buffalo were slaughtered.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.998 align:middle line:84%
That was the final
exclamation point

00:27:19.998 --> 00:27:22.040 align:middle line:84%
behind the destruction of
the Indian civilization

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:90%
because you were destroying--

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you imagine what this
experience must have been

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
for our people within 10 years
to lose their environment,

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to lose their food supply,
to lose the central object

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:90%
of their ritual life?

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is in your belief
that it was in this period

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
of hunting man and woman,
the time of hunting man,

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that human beings begin to
sense a stirring of the mythic

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:84%
imagination, the wonder of
thing that they didn't know?

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There is this burst of
magnificent art and all

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:84%
the evidence you need of a
mythic imagination and full

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You visited some of the
great painted caves in Europe.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me what you remember
when first you looked upon

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240 align:middle line:90%
those underground caves.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you didn't
want to leave.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Here, you come into
an enormous chamber,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.110 align:middle line:84%
like a great cathedral,
with these animals painted.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're painted with a
life like the life of an ink

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:84%
on silk, in the
Japanese painting.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize the
darkness is inconceivable,

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:84%
we're there with
electric lights,

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
but in a couple of
instances, the concierge,

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
the man who was showing us
through, turned off the lights

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and you were never in darker
darkness in your life.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like a-- I don't know--
just a complete knock-out

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:84%
of, you don't know where you
are, whether you're looking

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.290 align:middle line:90%
north, south, east, or west.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
All orientation is
gone, and you're

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.152 align:middle line:84%
in a darkness that
never saw the sun.

00:29:09.152 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Then they turn the
lights on again,

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and you see these
gloriously painted animals--

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:19.550 align:middle line:84%
a bull that will be 20
feet long and painted

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:84%
so that their haunches
will be represented

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.970 align:middle line:90%
by a swelling in the rock.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
They take account
of the whole thing.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever look at these
primitive art objects and think

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.220 align:middle line:84%
not of the art, but of the
man or woman standing there,

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:90%
painting or creating?

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:90%
I find that's where I speculate.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what hits you
when you go into those caves,

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:84%
What was in their mind
when they were doing that?

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's not an
easy thing to do.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And how did they get up there?

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And how did they see anything?

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
light did they have?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
There are little flashing
torches, flickering things,

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's something
about grace and perfection.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And with respect to
the problem of beauty,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.890 align:middle line:84%
is this beauty
intended, or is it

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
something that is the
natural expression

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.510 align:middle line:90%
of a beautiful spirit?

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.580 align:middle line:84%
When you hear a bird sing,
the beauty of the bird song,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.990 align:middle line:90%
is this intentional?

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.970 align:middle line:90%
In what sense is it intentional?

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's the expression of the
bird, the beauty of the bird's

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:90%
spirit, you might almost say.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that way very
often about this art.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:84%
To what degree was the
intention of the artist what

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
we would call aesthetic, or
to what degree expressive

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and to what degree something
that they simply had learned

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:90%
to do that way at a point?

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
When a spider makes
a beautiful web,

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:84%
the beauty comes out
of the spider's nature.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It's instinctive beauty.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And how much of the
beauty of our own lives

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.910 align:middle line:90%
is of the beauty of being alive?

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And how much of it is
conscious, intentional?

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a big question.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:06.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You call them temple cave.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Why temple?

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Temple with images and
stained glass windows,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:84%
cathedrals are a
landscape of the soul.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:22.310 align:middle line:84%
You move into a world
of spiritual images.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what this is.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:84%
When Jean and I, my wife
and I, drove down from Paris

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to this part of
France, we stopped off

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:90%
at Chartres Cathedral.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:90%
There is a cathedral.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into
the cathedral,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:84%
it's the mother womb of your
spiritual life, Mother Church.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.320 align:middle line:84%
All the forms around
are significant

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.960 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual values.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:10%
And the imagery is an
anthropomorphic form--

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.380 align:middle line:10%
God, and Jesus and the saints
in all-- in human form.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Human form.

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Then we went down to Lascaux.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:90%
The images were in animal form.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.060 align:middle line:90%
The form is secondary.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The message is what's
important here.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> The message of the cave.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The message of the cave,
yes, of a relationship of time

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to eternal powers that is
somehow to be experienced

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:90%
in that place.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, when you're
down in those caves,

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:84%
it's a strange transformation
of consciousness you have.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You feel this is the womb.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the place
from which life comes.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And that world up there in
the sun with all those--

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.090 align:middle line:90%
that's a secondary world.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:90%
This is primary.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this just overcomes you.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.513 align:middle line:84%
>> You had that feeling
when you were there.

00:32:48.513 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I had it every time.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Now what were these
caves used for?

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The speculations that are most
common of scholars interested

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:84%
in this is that they had to
do with the initiation of boys

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:90%
into the hunt.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.890 align:middle line:90%
You go in there, it's dangerous.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It's very dangerous.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It's completely dark.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It's cold and dank.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
You're banging your head on
projections all the time.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was a place of fear.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And the boys were
to overcome all that

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and go into the
womb of the Earth.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And the shamans
or whoever it was

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that would be
helping you through

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:90%
would not be making it easy.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And then there was a release
once you got into that vast

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.180 align:middle line:90%
torch-lit chamber down there.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.380 align:middle line:90%
What was the tribe?

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:38.840 align:middle line:84%
What was the tradition
trying to say to the boy?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the womb land from
which all the animals come.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And the rituals down
there have to do

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.370 align:middle line:84%
with the generation of
a situation that will

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:90%
be propitious for the hunt.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And the boys were to
learn not only to hunt,

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.830 align:middle line:84%
but how to respect
the animals and what

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:84%
rituals to perform, and
how, in their own lives, no

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:84%
longer to be little
boys, but to be men.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Because those hunts were
very, very dangerous

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:90%
hunts, believe me.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And these are the original
men's rite sanctuaries,

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:20.630 align:middle line:84%
where the boys became no
longer their mother's sons,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:90%
but their father's sons.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't you wonder what
effect this had on a boy?

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you can go
through it today, actually,

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.540 align:middle line:84%
in cultures that are still
having the initiations with

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.800 align:middle line:90%
young boys.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
They give them an ordeal,
a terrifying ordeal,

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:84%
that the youngster
has to survive.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.980 align:middle line:90%
Makes a man of them, you know?

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
>> What would happen to me as
a child if I went through one

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:48.907 align:middle line:84%
of these rites, as
far as you can--

00:34:48.907 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we know what
they do in Australia.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And when a boy gets to be
a little bit ungovernable,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.110 align:middle line:84%
one fine day, the men come
in, and they're naked,

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
except for stripes
of white down that

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.770 align:middle line:84%
have been stuck on
their bodies and stripes

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:90%
with their men's blood.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:84%
They used their own blood
for glue, gluing this on.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're swinging
the bullroarers, which

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.050 align:middle line:90%
are the voice of the spirits.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And they come as spirits.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The boy will try to take
refuge with his mother.

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
She'll pretend to
try to protect him.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.770 align:middle line:90%
The men just take him away.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:84%
The mother's no good
from then on, you see?

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.660 align:middle line:90%
He's no longer a little boy.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.850 align:middle line:90%
He's in the men's group.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they put him
really through an ordeal.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.130 align:middle line:90%
These are the rites--

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.050 align:middle line:90%
circumcision, subincision.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And the whole purpose is to--

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Turn him into a
member of the tribe.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>> And a hunter.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And a hunter.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that was
the way of life.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but most important is
to live according to the needs

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:90%
and the values of that tribe.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:84%
He is initiated in a
short period of time

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.688 align:middle line:84%
into the whole culture
context of his people.

00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> [WHOOPING]

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So myth relates directly
to ceremony and tribal ritual.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And the absence of myth
can mean the end of ritual.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> A ritual is the
enactment of a myth.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.590 align:middle line:84%
By participating
in a ritual, you

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:90%
are participating in a myth.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does
it mean, you think,

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to young boys today that
they're absent these myths?

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the confirmation
ritual is the counterpart today

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.955 align:middle line:90%
of these rites.

00:36:38.955 --> 00:36:41.470 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:46.980 align:middle line:84%
As a little Catholic boy, you
choose your confirmed name,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
the name you're going
to be confirmed by.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.860 align:middle line:90%
And you go up.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But instead of having them
scarify you, knock your teeth

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.650 align:middle line:84%
out and all, the bishop gives
you a mild slap on the cheek.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It's been reduced to that.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Nothing has happened to you.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.900 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish counterpart
is the bar mitzvah.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And whether it works,
actually, to effect

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:84%
a psychological
transformation I suppose

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:84%
will depend on the
individual case.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no problem
in these old days.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The boy came out with
a different body,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:90%
and he'd gone through something.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the female?

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of the figures
in the temple caves are male.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Was this a kind of secret
society for males only?

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't a secret society.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:90%
The boys had to go through it.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't know
exactly what happens

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:84%
with the female in this
period because we have very

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.480 align:middle line:90%
little evidence to tell us.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.870 align:middle line:84%
In primary cultures
today, the girl

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:84%
becomes a woman with
her first menstruation.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:90%
It happens to her.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, nature does it to her.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, she has undergone
the transformation.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And what is her initiation?

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Typically, it is to
sit in a little hut

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.510 align:middle line:84%
for a certain number of days
and realize what she is.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> How does she do that?

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> She sits there.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.280 align:middle line:90%
She's now a woman.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And what is a woman?

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:90%
A woman is a vehicle of life.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And life has overtaken her.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:90%
She is a vehicle now of life.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The woman is what it's all
about, the giving of birth

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:90%
and the giving of nourishment.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.320 align:middle line:84%
She's identical with the
Earth goddess and her powers.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And she's got to realize
that about herself.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The boy does not have a
happening of that time.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.610 align:middle line:84%
He has to be turned into
a man and voluntarily

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:52.230 align:middle line:84%
become a servant of something
greater than himself.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.780 align:middle line:84%
The woman becomes the
vehicle of nature.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The man becomes the vehicle of
the society, the social order,

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.996 align:middle line:90%
and the social purpose.

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happens when a
society no longer embraces

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:90%
powerful mythology?

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> What we've got on our hands.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They say if you
want to find what

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
it means to have a society
without any rituals, read

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:90%
"The New York Times."

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.337 align:middle line:90%
>> And you'd find?

00:39:20.337 --> 00:39:21.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the news of the day.

00:39:21.545 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The young people
who don't know how

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.030 align:middle line:84%
to behave in a
civilized society.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Have to imagine 50% of the crime
is by young people in their 20s

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and early 30s that just
behave like barbarians.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Society has provided
them no rituals--

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>> None.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>> --by which they
become members.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.048 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a
reduction, a reduction,

00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:90%
a reduction of ritual.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Roman
Catholic Church, my God.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.230 align:middle line:84%
They've translated the mass
out of the ritual language

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.470 align:middle line:84%
into a language that has a
lot of domestic associations

00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.980 align:middle line:84%
so that, I mean,
every time now that I

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:84%
read the Latin of the
mass or something,

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I get that pitch again
that it's supposed

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.360 align:middle line:84%
to give, a language
that throws you out

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of the field of your
domesticity, you know?

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The alter is turned so that
the priest's back is to you.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And with him, you address
yourself outward like that.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Now they turn the altar around.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It looks like Julia Child
giving a demonstration.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's all homely and cozy.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>> And they play a guitar.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They play a guitar.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Listen, they've forgotten what
the function of a ritual is.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It's to pitch you
out, not to wrap you

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:41.300 align:middle line:84%
back in where you have
been all the time.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So ritual that once conveyed
an inner reality is now merely

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.590 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's true in
the rituals of society

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and the personal rituals
of marriage and religion.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with respect to
ritual, it must be kept alive.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And so much of our
ritual is dead.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.780 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely
interesting to read

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.340 align:middle line:84%
of the primitive
elementary cultures,

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:84%
how the folktales,
the myths, they

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.320 align:middle line:84%
are transforming all the time
in terms of the circumstances

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:90%
of those people.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:25.760 align:middle line:84%
People move from an area where,
let's say, the vegetation

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.800 align:middle line:84%
is the main support
out into the plains.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Most of our Plains Indians in
the period of the horse riding

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Indians had originally been
of the Mississippian culture

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
along the Mississippi
in settled dwelling

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
towns and
agriculturally-based villages.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they received the
horse from the Spaniards,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and it makes it possible then
to venture out on the plains

00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and handle the great hunt of
the buffalo herds you see.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And the mythology transforms
from vegetation to buffalo.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
structure of the earlier

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:15.710 align:middle line:84%
vegetation mythologies under
the mythologies of the Dakota

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Indians and the Pawnee Indians
and the Kiowa and so forth.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying that the
environment shapes the story?

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> They respond
to it, do you see?

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But we have a tradition that
comes from the first millennium

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.470 align:middle line:84%
BC somewhere else, and
we're handling that.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It has not turned
over and assimilated

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.190 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of our
culture and the new things

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that are possible and the
new vision of the universe.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It must be kept alive.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The only people that can
keep it alive are artists--

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Of artists?

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --of one kind or another,
that the artist is--

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:84%
his function is
the mythologization

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of the environment
and the world.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Artist being the poet,
the musician, the author.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> The writer.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I think we've had a
couple of greats in the recent

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I think of James Joyce
as such a revealer

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.460 align:middle line:84%
of the mysteries of growing
up and becoming a human being.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And for me, he and Thomas
Mann were my principal gurus,

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:84%
you might say, as I was
trying to shape my own life.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I think in the
visual arts, there

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:84%
were two men whose
work seemed to me

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.200 align:middle line:84%
to handle mythological
themes in a marvelous way.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And one was Paul Klee
and the other Picasso.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
These two men really knew what
they were doing all the way,

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I think, and had a
great versatility

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.936 align:middle line:90%
in their revelations.

00:43:44.936 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean our artists are
the mythmakers of our day.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The mythmakers in earlier
days were the counterparts

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.232 align:middle line:90%
of our artists.

00:43:53.232 --> 00:43:54.815 align:middle line:84%
>> They do the
paintings on the walls,

00:43:54.815 --> 00:43:56.820 align:middle line:90%
and they perform the rituals.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an old
romantic idea in German--

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:06.960 align:middle line:84%
[GERMAN],, that the poetry
of the traditional cultures

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas come
out of the folk.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:10.080 align:middle line:90%
They do not.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:84%
They come out of an
elite experience,

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:16.080 align:middle line:84%
the experience of people,
particularly gifted,

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.380 align:middle line:84%
whose ears are open to
the song of the universe.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And they speak to
the folk, and there

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is an answer from the
folk, which is then

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.040 align:middle line:90%
received as an interaction.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But the first impulse comes
from above, not from below,

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.240 align:middle line:84%
in the shaping of
folk traditions.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So who would have been
in these early elementary

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:37.680 align:middle line:84%
cultures, as you call them, the
equivalent of the poets today?

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>> The shamans.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.950 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is the person who
has, in his late childhood,

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:47.400 align:middle line:84%
early youth-- it could
be male or female--

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.880 align:middle line:84%
had an overwhelming
psychological experience

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:90%
that turns them totally inward.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.620 align:middle line:84%
The whole unconscious has opened
up, and they've fallen into it.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's been described
many, many times,

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and it occurs all the
way from Siberia right

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.340 align:middle line:84%
through the Americas
down to Tierra Del Fuego.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of schizophrenic
crack-up, the shaman

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.090 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of experience?

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Dying and resurrecting,
being on the brink of death

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and coming back-- actually
experience the death

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.810 align:middle line:84%
People who have
very deep dreams,

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.170 align:middle line:84%
dream is a great
source of the spirit.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And then people
who, in the woods,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.790 align:middle line:90%
have had mystical encounters.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me try to
be specific about it.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:39.360 align:middle line:84%
The shaman becomes some
person in a society who

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.780 align:middle line:84%
is drawn by experience
from the normal world

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.020 align:middle line:90%
into the world of the gifted?

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think of
shaman as a magician.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But they play a much
more important role

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.690 align:middle line:90%
than simply being a trickster.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, no, they play the role
that the priesthood plays

00:45:53.145 --> 00:45:53.945 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:45:53.945 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:90%
These are the first priests?

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a major
difference, as I see it,

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.660 align:middle line:90%
between a shaman and a priest.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:05.820 align:middle line:84%
A priest is a functionary
of a social sort.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.620 align:middle line:84%
The society worships certain
deities in a certain way.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And the priest becomes
ordained as a functionary

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.840 align:middle line:90%
to carry on that ritual.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And the deity to
whom he is devoted

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:22.740 align:middle line:84%
is a deity that was there
before he came along.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The shaman's powers are
symbolized in familias, deities

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:30.780 align:middle line:90%
of his own personal experience.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And his authority comes out of
a psychological experience, not

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.930 align:middle line:90%
a social ordination.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand what I mean?

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And the one who had this
psychological experience,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.160 align:middle line:84%
this traumatic
experience, this ecstasy,

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.090 align:middle line:84%
would become the interpreter
for others of things not seen?

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> He would become the
interpreters of a heritage

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:84%
of mythological
life, you might say.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And ecstasy was a part of
it very often in the shamanic

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.158 align:middle line:84%
>> It is ecstasy, yes,
no doubt about it.

00:46:59.158 --> 00:47:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The trance
dance, for example,

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.820 align:middle line:90%
in the bushmen society--

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there's a fantastic
example of something.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.430 align:middle line:84%
The little bushmen
groups, their whole life

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.250 align:middle line:90%
is one of great, great tension.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The male and female
sexes are, what we say,

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.610 align:middle line:90%
in a disciplined way, separate.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:24.000 align:middle line:84%
The men have a certain field
of concerns-- their weapons

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and the poisons and
the hunt and all that.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And the women have a
certain field of concern--

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.592 align:middle line:84%
the bringing up the children,
the nourishing of the children,

00:47:30.592 --> 00:47:32.400 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.687 align:middle line:84%
Only in the dance do
the two come together.

00:47:35.687 --> 00:47:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And they come together this way.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The women sit in a circle
or in a little group.

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And they then become the center
around which the men dance.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And they control the dance
and what goes on with the men

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.807 align:middle line:84%
through their own singing
and beating of the thighs.

00:47:51.807 --> 00:47:53.265 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the
significance of that,

00:47:53.265 --> 00:47:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that the woman is
controlling the dance?

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the woman is life, and
the man is the servant of life.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And during the course of
this circling, circling,

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:06.840 align:middle line:84%
it's a very tense style
of movement the men have,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.980 align:middle line:84%
suddenly that one of
them will pass out.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.480 align:middle line:90%
He's in a trance now.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is a description
of an experience.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>> [SINGING]

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> When people sing, I dance.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.860 align:middle line:90%
I end at the Earth.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:26.640 align:middle line:84%
I go in at a place like a
place where people drink water.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I travel a long way, very far.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.530 align:middle line:84%
When I emerge, I'm
already climbing.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm climbing threads.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.170 align:middle line:90%
I climb one and leave it.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Then I climb another one.

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Then I leave it,
and I climb another.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:84%
When you arrive at God's
place, you make yourself small.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You come in small
to God's place.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.470 align:middle line:84%
You do what you
have to do there.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Then you return to
where everyone is.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:84%
You come, and come, and
come, and finally, you

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:56.560 align:middle line:90%
enter your body again.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.460 align:middle line:84%
All the people who have stayed
behind are waiting for you.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.530 align:middle line:90%
They fear you.

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.460 align:middle line:90%
You enter into the Earth.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And you return to enter
the skin of your body.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And you say, that is the sound
of your return to your body.

>> The [NON-ENGLISH]
is there around.

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:19.170 align:middle line:84%
They take hold of
your head and blow

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:20.970 align:middle line:90%
about the sides of your face.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:23.720 align:middle line:84%
This is how you manage
to be alive again.

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Friends, if they don't
do that to you, you die.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.280 align:middle line:90%
You just die and are dead.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Friends, this is what it does,
this [NON-ENGLISH] that I do,

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.241 align:middle line:84%
this [NON-ENGLISH]
here that I dance.

>> [SINGING]

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> This is an actual experience
of transit from the Earth

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.610 align:middle line:84%
through the realm of
mythological images to God,

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.700 align:middle line:90%
or to the seat of power.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It becomes something
of the other mind of us.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It is exactly on the mind.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And the way God is imaged,
God is transcendent finally

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of anything like a name of God.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.560 align:middle line:84%
As the Hindus say,
beyond names and forms,

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:84%
beyond [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
beyond names and forms.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.320 align:middle line:90%
No tongue has soiled it.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:90%
No word has reached it.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> But can Westerners grasp
this kind of mystical trance,

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.560 align:middle line:90%
theological experience?

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It does transcend theology.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.800 align:middle line:90%
It leaves theology behind.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're locked
to the image of God

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.680 align:middle line:84%
in a culture where
science determines

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.720 align:middle line:84%
your perceptions of
reality, how can you

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:42.610 align:middle line:84%
experience this ultimate ground
that the shamans talk about?

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The best example I know
in our literature is that

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:51.280 align:middle line:84%
beautiful book by John Neihardt
called "Black Elk Speaks."

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Black Elk was a--

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Black Elk was a young
Sioux, or a Dakota,

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:02.080 align:middle line:84%
as they're often called,
boy, about nine years old,

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.230 align:middle line:84%
before the American cavalry
had encountered the Sioux.

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.380 align:middle line:84%
They were the great
people of the plains.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.740 align:middle line:90%
And this boy became sick.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.480 align:middle line:84%
He's psychologically
sick, his family

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.260 align:middle line:84%
telling the typical
shaman story.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:24.940 align:middle line:84%
The child begins to
tremble and is immobilized.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And the family is terribly
concerned about it.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And they send for
a shaman, who had

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.320 align:middle line:84%
had the experience
in his own youth,

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:35.440 align:middle line:84%
to come as a psychoanalyst,
you might say, and pull

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.760 align:middle line:90%
the youngster out of it.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.650 align:middle line:84%
But instead of relieving
him of the deities,

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:45.400 align:middle line:84%
he is adapting him to the
deities and the deities

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:47.290 align:middle line:90%
to himself, you might say.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a different problem
from that of psychoanalysis,

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.400 align:middle line:90%
where you--

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Nietzsche
who said be careful

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.390 align:middle line:84%
lest than casting
out your devil,

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.690 align:middle line:84%
you cast out the best
thing that's in you.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Here, the deities who have
been encountered-- the powers,

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.270 align:middle line:90%
let's call them--

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:09.710 align:middle line:90%
are retained.

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:10.990 align:middle line:90%
The connection is retained.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not broken.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And these men then become the
spiritual advisors and gift

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.120 align:middle line:90%
givers of their people.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened
with this young boy--

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:25.070 align:middle line:84%
he was about nine years
old-- was he had a vision.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And the vision is
described, and it's

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:29.920 align:middle line:84%
a vision prophetic of
the terrible future

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.650 align:middle line:90%
that his tribe was to have.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But it also spoke of the
possible positive aspects

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.280 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a vision of what he
called the hoop of his nation,

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.370 align:middle line:84%
realizing that it was
one of many hoops, which

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is something that we haven't
all learned well enough yet,

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and the cooperation of
all the hoops of all

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:54.770 align:middle line:84%
the nations and grand
processions and so forth.

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:58.480 align:middle line:84%
But more than that, it was
an experience of himself

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:04.240 align:middle line:84%
as going through the
realms of spiritual imagery

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that were of his culture and
assimilating there in part.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It comes to one great statement.

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:13.990 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's a key statement
to the understanding

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of myth and symbols.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He says, I saw myself on the
central mountain of the world,

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.690 align:middle line:90%
the highest place.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had a vision because I
was seeing in a sacred manner

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.130 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred
central mountain was

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Harney Peak in South Dakota.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, but the
central mountain is everywhere.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.770 align:middle line:84%
That is a real,
mythological realization.

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It distinguishes between
the local cult image--

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Harney Peak-- and
its connotation--

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.680 align:middle line:90%
the center of the world.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The center of the world is
the hub of the universe,

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.330 align:middle line:90%
axis mundi, you know?

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:10.530 align:middle line:84%
The central point, pole star
around which all revolves.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.330 align:middle line:84%
The central point
of the world is

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:15.780 align:middle line:84%
the point where stillness
and movement are together.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Movement is time.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Stillness is eternity.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Realizing the relationship
of the temporal moment

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to the eternal, not moment, but
forever is the sense of life.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Realizing how this
moment in your life

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is actually a moment of
eternity and the experience

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:39.840 align:middle line:84%
of the eternal
aspect of what you're

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:45.900 align:middle line:84%
doing in the temporal experience
is the mythological experience.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And he had it.

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So this--

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So is the central mountain
of the world Jerusalem, Rome,

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Banaras, Lhasa,
Mexico City, you know?

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Mexico City,
Jerusalem is symbolic

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:05.410 align:middle line:84%
of a spiritual principle
as the center of the world.

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So this little Indian was
saying there is a shining point

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.950 align:middle line:90%
where all lines intersect?

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly what he said.

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> He was saying God
has no circumference?

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>> God is an intelligible
sphere than, say,

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:28.620 align:middle line:84%
a sphere known to the
mind, not to the senses,

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:33.090 align:middle line:84%
whose center is everywhere
and circumference nowhere.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And the center, Bill, is
right where you're sitting.

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
right where I'm sitting.

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:46.410 align:middle line:10%
And each of us is a
manifestation of that mystery.
