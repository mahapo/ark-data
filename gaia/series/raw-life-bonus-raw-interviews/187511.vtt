00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a clinical
nutritionist in New York City.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I've had a practice
for 40 years.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I've probably seen 25,000
people over the last 40 years.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I've been eating 100% raw.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat cooked food.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So what I encourage
people to do is to eat--

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:90%
don't overdo anything.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Eat a variety of
different foods.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:90%
Try not to overeat.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Try not to eat in between meals.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>> I was eating, you
know, the sad diet,

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:90%
the standard American diet.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:84%
I was eating as much steak
as I could, if I was lucky,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.797 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I just
noticed, every time I'd

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
eat a steak or a
burger or something,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.855 align:middle line:84%
I'd just want to go lay down
on the couch after a while,

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, get a
nap or something,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the effects
of food that people do like.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:84%
They like to get
narced from their food.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.256 align:middle line:90%
I know I do.

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Get that please feeling in
your gut after, you know,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Thanksgiving or whatever,
and sit back on the couch.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But as an energetic
pursuit, I would

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.943 align:middle line:84%
say everything began, for
me, where I just didn't

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:90%
want to have to go lay down.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%
So I stopped eating red meat.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually I
stopped consuming dairy,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:84%
because I had tons of acne, and
red discoloration on my face,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and always mucousy.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like 23
or 24 or something,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and this girl just happened
to sit down next to me

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
on this bus, going from
St. Louis to Oklahoma City.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at me and says,
"You're lactose intolerant."

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, "What?"

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.750 align:middle line:84%
She says, "You need
to stop doing dairy,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
all these symptoms
you've got," you know,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
which I just detailed,
"will go away."

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, you know, I've
been to all kinds of doctors

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.352 align:middle line:84%
and specialists who
had told me they really

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what it was I
was allergic to, definitely

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.215 align:middle line:84%
And you're telling
me it's dairy?

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, milk does a
body good, doesn't it?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, I stopped
three days later.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
All those symptoms went
away, never to return.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's how everything--
everything kind of

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
began naturally.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Nwenna Kai, and
I'm the owner and culinary

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:84%
designer of Taste of the
Goddess Cafe in Los Angeles.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
I moved to Los Angeles about
four years ago from Chicago.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was when I was in
Chicago that I decided

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:90%
to adopt a raw food diet.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I had been vegan for a very,
very, very long time, probably

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
since I was about 18-years-old,
eating mostly a cooked vegan

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But I was sick a lot from eating
a lot of tofu, a lot of seitan,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of meat
substitute dishes.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to eat salads
and to drink fresh green juices

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
for about a week.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
My digestion cleared
up from eating

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:90%
just salads and fresh juices.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And I then just kept
doing that and kept

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:90%
doing it and doing that.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Literally like that next month,
I went on a yoga retreat.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
salad line, still

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
eating all salads,
and happened to meet

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:90%
someone who was a raw foodist.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And that person introduced
me to my first raw food

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
restaurant, which was in Chicago
called Karyn's Fresh Corner.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.745 align:middle line:84%
And from there I started taking
classes and I bought books.

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:84%
I bought all the
equipment, and just

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
turned my kitchen
into a laboratory

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:90%
for experimenting on food.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And I then started to go
online and find recipes.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there were raw food
chatrooms and things like that.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And just, the more
that I was seeking

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and
information about it,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.332 align:middle line:84%
the more things
opened up for me.

00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Brendan Brazier.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Vancouver BC.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I did triathlons
professionally for six years,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
ironman triathlons.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I started when I was around
15 to doing triathlons.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So I was eating lots of
peanut butter and bread

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and things that were
very high in calories.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.170 align:middle line:84%
But I was tired, and
I didn't know why.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Because calories
measure a food's energy.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.302 align:middle line:84%
I figured the more energy
I took in threw calories

00:03:59.302 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
the more energy I would have.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't the case.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But making that
transition more to raw,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:90%
that problem totally cleared up.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could actually get away
with eating 20% or 30% fewer

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
calories and having
more energy, even

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
though I didn't have
the calories, just

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.800 align:middle line:90%
because I was conserving it.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So energy through conservation,
as opposed to consumption

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.930 align:middle line:84%
became a huge part
of my program.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And replacing the heavier
foods, the peanut butter,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.180 align:middle line:84%
the bread with salads
and fruit, things

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:90%
that really will digest easily.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.493 align:middle line:90%
And that made a big difference.

00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> All growth is really
about eliminating that which

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Because your body
already has everything

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to replicate cells
perfectly, to inhibit disease

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.208 align:middle line:90%
from forming.

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So I would just say
in the beginning,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
just eliminate all things
white from your diet.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.520 align:middle line:90%
Eliminate the sugar.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Eliminate the white flour.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
If you can't
eliminate it totally,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.497 align:middle line:84%
cut back tremendously on
the dead meat products.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Begin to eliminate
that kind of thing,

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.560 align:middle line:90%
and begin to add living food.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Began to add live juices,
good water, good water that's

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:90%
alive into your body temple.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.917 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
results will begin

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:84%
to speak for themselves,
because there

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:90%
will come a mental clarity.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, people will
come out of this haze

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that they think is
normal, and a clarity

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:90%
will begin to descend upon them.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And once you taste
that clarity, you

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.228 align:middle line:84%
don't want to go back
into the fog again.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people aren't going
to be complete raw fooders.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.103 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big promoter of that
because I think most people are

00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:35.630 align:middle line:90%
all or nothing in that mindset.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
My view is, start to bring
these things to bear.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Start small, taking
a step at a time,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.098 align:middle line:84%
and let the process grow,
rather than going extreme.

00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:45.765 align:middle line:84%
Some people go extreme
because they can,

00:05:45.765 --> 00:05:48.812 align:middle line:84%
or because they have to, because
they're in a medical emergency.

00:05:48.812 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But most people, I think
have to be introduced.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.145 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
to these foods

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:84%
are actually tasty
and delicious.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.137 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, if you think you're
going to have to eat cardboard,

00:05:57.137 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's your
idea of raw food--

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.625 align:middle line:90%
discipline only lasts so long.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
You're only going
to do something

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:90%
that's painful so long.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
What gets people addicted,
in a positive sense,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
is when they start to have
their metabolism change,

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and they start to taste
this food and the flavors

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.803 align:middle line:90%
and they get excited about it.

00:06:12.803 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> What I've noticed, just in
the community here at Agape,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.010 align:middle line:84%
as people begin to go through
their transition diet,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately
add more raw--

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:90%
tremendous energy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.550 align:middle line:84%
They all report back
to me the same thing.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:84%
They have all this
energy now, where

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
they used to have
that afternoon lag

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
or needing to nap for
long periods of time.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.570 align:middle line:90%
That seems to dissolve.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lot of energy.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And it lasts enough time where
we know that it's not just

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.023 align:middle line:84%
a mental hypnotism,
where it's like,

00:06:44.023 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
they've heard about
it for so long

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, I'm going
to have this energy,

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.972 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly they
have it, and it only

00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:90%
lasts for a few days.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
We've noticed that
people, they continue

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
to have a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Also the mood swing that
a lot of the people have.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's almost predictable.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
This seems to break the
cycle of that downward spiral

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.400 align:middle line:84%
of their moods, and
they're able to stay even

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:90%
for longer periods of time.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the habits that took
me a long time to overcome was

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:90%
eating late at night.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And I come to realize that
was wasn't very good for us

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
at all, because it could
cause serious problems.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
eating a bad diet,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:84%
you're eating late at night, you
get up in the middle of night

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and having a pastrami
sandwich, then

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wonder why you
have to sleep 13 hours a night.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to have
two or three cups of coffee

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.210 align:middle line:84%
to be able to run on
stimulated energy.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:84%
When you eat small
amounts of food,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
you're eating nutrient-dense
food that's raw,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
you could probably
get by on two or three

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:84%
hours sleep at night
without no problem,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%
and you wake up fully refreshed.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> They got to somehow
get people in their family

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:90%
or circle who are supportive.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise it's really
hard, I think, really hard.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And just for me to be
more raw than cooked

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.288 align:middle line:84%
is generally about
people around me.

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I don't
have someone, at least

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.293 align:middle line:90%
one person helping me--

00:08:11.293 --> 00:08:13.460 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have that, and
you're like, going home,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and there ain't one other person
eating what you're eating?

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.667 align:middle line:90%
My god, that's tough.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have
to learn to love a salad,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.886 align:middle line:84%
and learn to make good salad,
and some good salad dressing.

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The one thing I have to
say about raw food nutrition

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and living food nutrition
is, when it comes to food

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.730 align:middle line:84%
preparation, I'm
completely retarded.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't
even make a salad.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:90%
It's totally ridiculous.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, I've
just orientated myself

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.432 align:middle line:84%
to doing it with blenders,
and just blending everything,

00:08:43.432 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:90%
and just drinking that.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:90%
That's how I live.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got to at least open
yourself up to the possibility

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:90%
that you can do it.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the universe will
just say, hey, check this out.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.190 align:middle line:90%
You could have this.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can go down to the
local health food store

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and have them make
a juice up for you.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
The innovative ability to create
our reality by the way we speak

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:12.585 align:middle line:84%
and by our will is ultimately
capable of doing anything.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Just start.

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:90%
Start doing something.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.233 align:middle line:90%
Start taking those steps.

00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how small
they are in the beginning.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It may take-- someone on
a standard American diet,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
it may take a year
to transition.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It may take two
years, in some cases.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
break those cravings

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and you get away
from actually wanting

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.463 align:middle line:84%
food that's bad for you,
then it's all very easy.

00:09:33.463 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing I always
tell people is to don't be

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:90%
so extreme with it at first.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.297 align:middle line:84%
When I first started eating
raw, I was eating completely raw

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
and then sometimes I
was eating cooked food.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just
really important

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to kind of go with the flow and
do what your body wants to do.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And even now, I mean,
there's some times

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that I may have some
steamed brown rice,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or I may steam
vegetables, especially

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
like in the wintertime, or
have warm soups, or something

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
In the summertime, because
it's hot, I eat mostly fruits.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't really even eat salads.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.470 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And I drink a lot of coconut
water and a lot of water.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.632 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, a lot of people,
they're always wondering, well,

00:10:07.632 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
like, if you're
eating just fruits,

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting
your vegetables,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.252 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:10:11.252 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And what I always have
to say to that is,

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I've been eating like
this for eight years

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.748 align:middle line:90%
and I have been sick.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had a headache.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had a cold.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
I've never had the flu.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.253 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, I must be
doing something right.

00:10:24.253 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think first you've got
to see what's going to make you

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
actually do this.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think when people
experience a change

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%
or transformation, there's
a chemistry to that.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
There's elements
that have to happen.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:90%
The first thing is satiation.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.437 align:middle line:84%
You know, if your favorite
meal is prime rib and lobster,

00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and you eat it breakfast,
lunch, and dinner,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
there's a point in
which you get satiated.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough anymore.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't please you.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.272 align:middle line:84%
And satiation makes people start
looking for an alternative.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That usually isn't enough
to push them over the edge.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.813 align:middle line:84%
Usually it takes them to have
to start to get to a point

00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:84%
where they really
get frustrated,

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.315 align:middle line:84%
where it's not just
satiated, but now, I'm

00:10:56.315 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:90%
not getting rewarded.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I keep eating this
way, living this way,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not happy
about the outcome.

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Then people get to a threshold
where it's like, OK, I'm done.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:90%
This is enough.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Enough already.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I've got to shift.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, that
search becomes a hunger.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
They really look for a
new answer in their life.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when that happens,
usually they get an insight.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
They start to say, oh
my gosh, it's my diet.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Oh my gosh, you know, I'm
addicted to this food.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Or oh my gosh, my relationship's
a reflection of how I do this.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I go for comfort, and I never go
through to what really matters,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.080 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I never face up to it.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And that insight
creates an opening,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
where they have a
chance to make a change.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But what you have to
do is at that moment,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.587 align:middle line:90%
you've got to take some action.

00:11:34.587 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, it's like
the opening closes and you

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.087 align:middle line:84%
start all over,
and you have to go

00:11:38.087 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
through satiation and
dissatisfaction and threshold

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So I say to people,
grab the opening.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Grab the insight.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, being dissatisfied
is a great thing.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:90%
It can produce drive in you.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you're going
to do it, find something

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that you know you can
do in a lasting format.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.295 align:middle line:84%
If you're an extremist and
you really live extreme,

00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it's
go pure, raw food

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and you'll love it because
you're a new person.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
that, if comfort

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:84%
is really important
to you, then I'd

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
start to explore, what are
some of those raw foods

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:90%
that I really like?

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not forcing
myself to do this.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm really enjoying it.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'd introduce 20%,
25% of those raw foods.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Then the energy
starts to take over.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:90%
You start feeling better.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, OK,
what else can I add?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, hopefully you
get yourself to 50%, 60%, 70%.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you get to that
point, you may not be perfect,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
but damn, you have
a lot of energy,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.748 align:middle line:84%
and you feel a vitality
that you've never

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:90%
felt before in your life.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
positive addiction.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
