00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY ROBBINS: I look for
alkaline foods, alive foods,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.857 align:middle line:90%
what I call water-rich foods.

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That means the water
is still in them.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.648 align:middle line:90%
The aliveness is still there.

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:11.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not all cooked out.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.167 align:middle line:84%
>>WOODY HARRELSON: Enzymes are
the life force of the food.

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:18.600 align:middle line:84%
When you cook anything over
118 degrees for one minute,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:84%
it destroys all of the enzymes
and most of the nutritional

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:90%
value of the food.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%
There go the saying, like David
Wolfe, the raw food lexicon,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
is that cooked food
is poison, because it

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes something toxic
for the body to deal with.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>>KARYN CALABRESE: Microwave
oven food is the worst.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is by far--

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
our bodies do not recognize
the structure of the proteins

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:90%
that the food is changed to.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no digestive
enzymes produced because you

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:90%
don't smell the food.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't see the food.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So cooked foods really take
on a very destructive--

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:84%
but they're also extremely
acidic and extremely addictive.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So once you start
eating cooked foods,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%
you want more and more and more.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
And to break the
cycle, you really

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:90%
need to do a detox or a cleanse.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
It really is very
beneficial in helping

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.322 align:middle line:84%
to break that cycle of
craving the cooked foods.

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WOLFE: When you have
the food in its raw condition,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:90%
you have more nutrients present.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
You have more
vitamin C. You have

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
more minerals that
are available,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>>JOEL FUHRMAN: To have
to be in good health,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
we want to eat a diet
that's higher in nutrients

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and low in calories.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.142 align:middle line:84%
That means you have
to eat foods that

00:01:23.142 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
are largely high-nutrient
low-calorie foods.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the foods that
are highest in nutrients

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
are green vegetables, tomatoes,
berries, oranges, carrots.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get
a diet higher in fiber,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
higher in high nutrients, higher
and phytochemicals, right.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:90%
It's going to get--

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
it's automatically not
going to be acid forming.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
all those features

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.585 align:middle line:84%
that people that each
fed diet looks at or all

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:53.723 align:middle line:84%
put together when you eat a
diet that's very nutrient-dense.

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIAN CLEMENT: What we've
unveiled in our research

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
is that there are four major
components in raw living

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
food that make them
viable for healing

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and prevention of disease.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
First are hormones,
second is oxygen,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
third is phytonutrients,
and fourth is enzymes.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Here, we've coined
the phrase, HOPE.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a new era of
nutritional hope,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's why living
food is superior.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you live longer as
well as prevent and eliminate

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.738 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE ADAMS: I mean,
think about pharmaceuticals

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.125 align:middle line:84%
They are one isolated
chemical extract,

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
a synthesized chemical,
usually something

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
that never appears in
nature and certainly

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
doesn't appear in
that concentration

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and in that isolation.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.615 align:middle line:84%
Pharmaceuticals then become
like poisons to the human body.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And the side
effects that you see

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
are just the effects
of the poison.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But in nature, you never see
a chemical isolated like that.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
In a plant, you
might have hundreds

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:90%
of different phytochemicals.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consider the
natural medicines

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:90%
that are really in raw foods.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
These are medicines
synthesized by nature.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:84%
They're like little-plant
based pharmaceuticals,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
but they're built
by mother nature,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
not by some
pharmaceutical laboratory.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are
naturally biocompatible

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
with the human body.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you take
those in, you get

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
healthy because the plant
actually built those medicines

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to keep itself healthy.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And they all work in concert.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.325 align:middle line:84%
There's a synergistic healing
effect of those nutrients.

00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that
from a drug, but you

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
do get that when
you eat raw foods,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
or you drink a
raw food smoothie.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You get those hundreds of
different nutrients working

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:84%
in concert to heal your body
and to essentially activate

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.903 align:middle line:84%
that healing potential
that's built into your body.

00:03:41.903 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Working with hundreds
of thousands of people now,

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
we've developed a quite keen
understanding on what makes

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
the anatomy of the body function
and the immune system protect

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:84%
We've seen thousands, then
of thousands of people,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:84%
recover from
catastrophic disease.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And it primarily comes on a
dietary level from a green food

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.140 align:middle line:84%
diet with either the total
elimination or short term

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
elimination of all fruits and a
lot of nutrition from sprouts.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Sprouts are 10 to 30
times more nutritious

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
than the best organic vegetable
that you pick wash and eat.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
An average sprout like clover
is 10 times more nutritious,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
something like wheat grass
or sunflower greens, 30 times

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.098 align:middle line:90%
more nutritious.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> KIRT TYSON: One of the
leaders in the raw food

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:90%
movement is Victoria Boutenko.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Her family's recovering
from multiple illnesses

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.257 align:middle line:90%
is a nutritional success story.

00:04:35.257 --> 00:04:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BRIAN CLEMENT: As
you probably know,

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
my family became ill
about 14 years ago.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in my
family became so ill

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors told us
we don't have any hope.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And I will soon die, and
my husband will soon die,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and our children
will be miserable.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>VICTORIA BOUTENKO: And
I was only 38-years-old,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't want to die.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.377 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want my
children to be miserable,

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
so I decided to look
for alternative.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was searching and
searching and searching,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't give up.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I
discovered raw food.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And within three
and a half months,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
my family ran 10 kilometer
race, Bolder Boulder.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And we were feeling better
and better and better.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:84%
About seven years into raw food
diet, we reached a plateau.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
When everybody in
my family stopped

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
feeling better and
better and better,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%
we actually stopped improving.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And then several months later,
we started to fall backwards.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We started to develop
some unwanted symptoms

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:90%
of not perfect health.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in my family developed
at least one wart, which

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:90%
is a symptom of low immunity.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
how in the world?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We're on a raw food diet
that got us rid of all

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:90%
these horrible illnesses.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
How in the world we
could have low immunity?

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Now we're eating better than
seven years ago because we now

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:90%
eat all organic, mostly local.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And we now know things
like food combining.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I decided that I need to
figure out what's going on,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:90%
what's missing.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote the letter and sent
it to all raw food experts

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:90%
that I knew about in the world.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And I got answers
from almost everybody

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:84%
saying, yes, only we
reached the plateau

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:90%
much sooner than you did.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Then I asked them next
question, so what do you do?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
One person say, I now
drink goat's milk.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Another person says, I add
20% cooked food to my diet.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Another person says I add
this and this supplement.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And all of them saying
different things.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Then I send him again
a letter saying, well,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:90%
does it work for you?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And everybody
responded, not really.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
We're actually yo-yoing
back and forth,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:90%
still looking for a solution.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We still didn't find our balance
that something was missing.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like a puzzle that
didn't make no sense.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew that in my family that
was a raw food diet that helped

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:90%
us to get rid of our illnesses.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, it was the
same diet, even better

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
but now we were
feeling less healthy.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:84%
We did not get asthma
back, but we did not

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
get our sickness better, but
it was still not perfect.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I decided I have to make
my own research because I

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:90%
like puzzles.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I always have collections
of puzzles in my home.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I did,
first it made a list

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of USDA-recommended
nutrition that humans

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
have to consume in
order to be healthy.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Then I listed all the foods
that exist in the world,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
including meats and
dairy, everything.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be objective.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to play around

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
with this nutritional
compounds, trying

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
to create what would
be the variations

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:84%
of perfect human diet
that will satisfy

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:90%
human nutritional needs.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly discovered that
there was really not so much

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
food that is very healthy.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Most of the foods have something
1, something 2, and then

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%
everything else is missing.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, meats
have complex proteins,

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
but it has zero vitamin c, zero
fiber, zero antioxidants, just

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:90%
really, really nothing else.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that was like
this until I found

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:90%
one food that was different.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
When I found this food, it
appeared that it's like puzzle,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
fitting human nutrition
is perfect-like.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:90%
It was like, wow.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.620 align:middle line:90%
And that was greens.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Then greens, they match
human nutrition so perfectly.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
They have in them
absolutely everything

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
we need, except the one
thing, except a vitamin B12.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is in there.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Essential vitamins,
these are vitamins

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:84%
means that our body
needs to be healthy.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:90%
Greens have all of them.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to have.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what kale has.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what the weeds have.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Essential minerals, that's
what we need to have.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what kale has.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what the weeds have.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Essential amino acid acids,
that's what we need to have.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.683 align:middle line:90%
That's what weeds have.

00:08:56.683 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what we need to have.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:90%
That's with kale has.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
For comparison, I
placed here apples.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Apples and carrots have
approximately similar content

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:90%
of essential amino acids.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And that explains--
if you look at here--

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
apples have some
protein, but not a lot.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And it explains why the
vegetables and fruits

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
are considered general,
not really great source

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of amino acids
because they were not

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
considering greens
as a really a source

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
because greens are
not very popular.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Not many people eat greens.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
greens the numbers,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:84%
the digits are the
same or bigger.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Like, here, we
have three digits.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have three
and four digits.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
In apples, we have
two or one digit.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So we see there was
a big difference.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:90%
And essential fatty acids.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So greens have
absolutely everything.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And yes, all the most experts
in nutrition in the world

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:84%
say, you need to eat
dark green vegetables.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.945 align:middle line:90%
But nobody says how much.

00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Nobody says you need to
have five cups a day.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:90%
You need to have 10 cups a day.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.443 align:middle line:90%
You need to have one cups a day.

00:10:03.443 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
All they say is the more
you can, as much as you can.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Then I decided to look
in the animal kingdom

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and to find an animal that
is the closest to humans

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:90%
and see what these animals eat.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered chimpanzee
because chimpanzees share

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
with humans 99.4 the
same sequences of genes.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
I made this diagram that
shows that chimpanzees consume

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:90%
half of their diet of fruits.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And the other almost
complete half are greens.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So chimpanzees consume
a lot of greens.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And they also consume
some seeds and some bark.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And they consume a
little bit of insects.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I made a chart of
a typical American diet.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.876 align:middle line:84%
And can you find two differences
in between these two charts?

00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] They're
quite different.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:90%
They're like opposite.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:84%
This is a nutritious food,
low-calorie, nutritious.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:84%
This is high-calorie,
low nutrition.
