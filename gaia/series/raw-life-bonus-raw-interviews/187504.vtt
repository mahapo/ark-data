>>KIRT TYSON: What
most people don't know

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.550 align:middle line:90%
is that diabetes can be cured.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:90%
How do I know?

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
type 1 diabetes.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
However, under the care
of Dr. Gabriel Cousens,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.000 align:middle line:90%
my life was totally transformed.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cousens had me
eat only raw foods

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and take live
supplements for 30 days.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
My glucose levels are
normal, and I still

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:90%
do not need to take insulin.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:90%
So what is diabetes?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%
What are the causes, symptoms,
and most importantly, the cure?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
This chapter addresses
those issues and much more.

>>GARY NULL: Diabetes is
a form of dysinsulinism,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning that a person
is either secreting

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
adequate amounts of
insulin, but the body is not

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:84%
able to utilize it,
or the body is not

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.100 align:middle line:84%
secreting from the pancreas
adequate amounts of insulin.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
In either case, the
person's blood sugar

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
becomes elevated and stays
elevated and therefore requires

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
some form of
intervention to lower it.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Diabetes is caused by
a combination of factors.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's mostly caused by
fat on the body, especially

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
fat on the midsection, because
abdominal fat represents fat

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
that's stored internally in your
tissues and around your organs.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So fat blocks the
absorption of insulin.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And then your pancreas is
asked to produce more insulin

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.732 align:middle line:84%
in response to the
blockage effect--

00:02:10.732 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:84%
the blocking effect of all
the extra fat on the body.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.565 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
pancreas poops out,

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
or it can't produce
so much insulin.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And now it's not
producing enough insulin

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.515 align:middle line:90%
for the body's needs.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:21.973 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIAN WHITAKER: People got
to realize that there are two

00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:90%
forms of diabetes--

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.470 align:middle line:84%
the type that needs the insulin,
and the type that just is

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:90%
diabetic because they're heavy.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, the type that has
diabetes cause they're heavy

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
actually is producing
more insulin

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
than the normal individual.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> In most cases
of type 2 diabetes,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the body is still producing
sufficient amount of insulin

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.625 align:middle line:84%
for a thin person, but just
not enough insulin for a fat

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:45.425 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:46.925 align:middle line:84%
And if the person
loses weight, they

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:49.438 align:middle line:84%
can become non-diabetic,
defined by the fact

00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that they don't need any
medication to keep their blood

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:90%
sugars in the normal range.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GABRIEL COUSENS: What are
the big causes of diabetes?

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:90%
High sugar, number one.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
20 years after sugar is
brought into any culture,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.960 align:middle line:90%
there's an outbreak of diabetes.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Two, meat and dairy in the diet.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
High animal fat is right up
there right behind sugar.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Three, caffeine.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
One cup of coffee will increase
your interim resistance by 33%.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Cigarettes do the same thing.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
They greatly increase your
insulin resistance, which

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:90%
is a precursor to diabetes.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Pesticides and herbicides
and heavy metals

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
tend to block the function
of the insulin system

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and increase your
insulin resistance.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WOLFE: The
symptoms of diabetes type 2

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.560 align:middle line:84%
when they first come on is
excessive urination or sweet

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
urine.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And that symptom is a clue as to
what the cause of diabetes is.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Excessive urination
is an inability

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to hold onto minerals or an
inability to utilize minerals.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It's an illness that
affects the pancreas.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that we are not
taught about the pancreas,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
but is true, is that the
pancreas has the largest draw

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.650 align:middle line:84%
or pull for trace minerals of
any organ or gland in our body.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In both type 1 and type 2,
if they are throwing in a lot

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:84%
of carbohydrate and a
lot of starch and a lot

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
of high-glycemic food
into the bloodstream--

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
you're eating cakes and
breads and pastas and things

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
like that, either
the body is going

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
to have to produce
a lot of insulin,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to have to
inject a lot of insulin.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.565 align:middle line:84%
You reduce that kind of
carbohydrate or sugar load;

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
your insulin requirement's
going to go way down.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.660 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is the kind of food

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
you eat is going to determine
the sensitivity of the insulin,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it is made by your
body or whether you inject it

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with
insulin, of course,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:84%
is that insulin is a
atherosclerotic-genic agent.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:84%
That means that insulin
promotes the progression

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.988 align:middle line:90%
of atherosclerosis.

00:04:59.988 --> 00:05:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And insulin increases
their appetite.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:90%
It makes them eat more.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
It makes them become
more overweight

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.803 align:middle line:84%
and then become more
diabetic and need

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:90%
more drugs and more insulin.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is not
insulin deficiency,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:90%
it's insulin resistance.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole approach of using
insulin to alleviate diabetic

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.627 align:middle line:90%
symptoms is a Band-Aid approach.

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a
dangerous approach

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.510 align:middle line:84%
because insulin is a synthetic
chemical that is mimicking

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:90%
the body's natural insulin.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's done.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of assumptions
that go into this understanding

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, we're just using
the same compound as your body

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:90%
produces.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same compound
because we're only

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
talking about one aspect
of the fabric of reality.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And part of that fabric
that flows one direction

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.248 align:middle line:90%
is chemistry.

00:05:45.248 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Part of the fabric that
flows the other direction

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
is the love, the overall
symbiotic relationship

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
of all the different chemicals
in the body to each other

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:90%
and all the difficult factors.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.328 align:middle line:84%
So to put just one part of it
in there, just that insulin,

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:90%
it's a Band-Aid approach.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, all the
problems still show up anyway.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And then insulin
resistance develops

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.170 align:middle line:84%
where the body starts to resist
this unnatural form of insulin.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of just
prolonging the inevitable.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also a fact of
nutrient nutritional imbalances

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and deficiencies that makes
the pancreas not responsive.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain
loss of function

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.987 align:middle line:84%
of the pancreas due to
the lack of phytonutrients

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and the variety of the
symphony of nutrients

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
we need for normal
tissue function.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the cells don't
function at full efficiency

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
when you just supply them
with some macronutrients.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
They need a full symphony of the
full complement of the artistry

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of
different discovered

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and undiscovered chemicals to
maximize cellular function.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Attempting to alleviate the
symptoms of diabetes type 2

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
using pharmaceutical
medications,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
mineral-deficient food,
non-absorbable supplements is

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:90%
moot.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
We have to get right down
to the cause of the problem.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And the cause of the problem
is the poor quality of food--

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
not just the way
that it's raised.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But the soil quality,
the mineral density

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of the food when it reaches the
market, the whole entire way

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.320 align:middle line:90%
that food is actually eaten--

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
the processing of it, the
heating, the roasting,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and all those things are
decreasing the mineral

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:90%
availability of what's there.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.315 align:middle line:84%
And there's not much
there to even begin with.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MORGAN SPURLOCK: We
see so much money being

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:90%
spent on diabetes research.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And we see so much money just
being wasted in a lot of ways,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
research grants,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
or it's through
different drug plans.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And especially, when you look
at groups like the American

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes Association,
which continues

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to get money from people like
Cadbury Schweppes or Pepsi

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:90%
or candy companies--

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.090 align:middle line:84%
these are the people who
are financing studies--

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.005 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask yourself,
whose best interests are

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:09.805 align:middle line:90%
being served?

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.203 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're dealing with
something like diabetes,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a mineral deficiency
syndrome and coupled with that,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
a sugar addiction syndrome and
carbohydrate addiction problem,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
taking those people,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.905 align:middle line:84%
and you're putting them
on to natural food,

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:90%
you're getting two effects.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:84%
One is they're getting
real, nourishing food

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.182 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to have
an inhibition of appetite

00:08:39.182 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
almost immediately
where they're suddenly

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
not going to be hungry because
they're getting what they need.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to have
a detoxification effect, which

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:84%
is the effect of
pulling the plug out

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.460 align:middle line:84%
of the bathtub, a draining
away of all the stuff.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
The good stuff is
pushing out the bad.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Because once you really
get on the natural food,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and you have a little bit
of education around it,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
you realize that it's not the
food that's doing it to you.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It's your body saying, time
to get out the garbage.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> A person that's a diabetic,
exercise is critically

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
important because the amount of
sugar you're going to spill is

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
based on the calories you're
taking in and the calories

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
you're burning up in
your daily activity.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
diabetic, if you're

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.205 align:middle line:84%
eating blended salads
and a lot of greens,

00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
you're not eating
a lot of fruit,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and you're eating
some nut pates,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be burning up
everything you're taking in.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:84%
There isn't anything be
left over to spill sugar.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Years ago before they had
insulin, people that were

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.295 align:middle line:90%
diabetics, they starved them.

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Their blood sugar went
down, but some of them

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:90%
died from starvation.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have the information
available, especially

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.375 align:middle line:84%
with the greens and
understanding that greens

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
are secondary sunlight.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
They are, for an
efficient person--

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:90%
they provide a lot of energy.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.495 align:middle line:84%
You definitely can get
into a healthy diet,

00:09:58.495 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
be on a low-calorie diet,
slow down your aging process,

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
enable your body
to restore itself

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to restore its ability
so you will not

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.260 align:middle line:84%
be functioning like a type 2
or like any kind of a diabetic.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You just don't give
individuals food that are going

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:90%
to make the blood sugar go up.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
You concentrate
on protein foods.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
You eliminate a lot
of the dietary fats.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
You increase a lot
of the dietary fiber.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You increase a lot of
the vegetables, fruits

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit more
moderation, and you're

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.730 align:middle line:90%
going to get dramatic results.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Type 2 diabetes is very
much related genetically.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
85% of the people with type 2
have someone in their family

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:90%
who has a genetic tendency.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And now we need
to be very clear--

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:90%
genetics load the gun.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
A culture of death
lifestyle pulls the trigger.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So we can't say, oh,
it's my genetics.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:90%
That's a cop out.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.060 align:middle line:84%
What we are saying is, if
you lead a healthy lifestyle,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
you will upgrade your
genetic expression

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:90%
so you will not get diabetes.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Autoimmune diseases such
as diabetes represent-- well,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune is essentially
a Latin way of saying

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:90%
self-destruction.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is what autoimmune
diseases are-- so

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that the relevance about
these is that they're really

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%
brought on by the individual.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's their own
system acting in a sense

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
of overacting perhaps or
at least targeting self.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I know one woman
in particular.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
She's been a type 1
diabetic for over 30 years.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
She follows the best
diet I have ever seen.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:90%
She's a raw fooder.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.648 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't eat much
in the way of fruit.

00:11:46.648 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
She got her insulin
all the way down,

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
but she's never been successful
in coming off her insulin.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's a
unique individual.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, diabetes is a killer.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But diabetes almost
never comes along.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is if you
have a therapy for diabetes,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and you focus just on diabetes,
you miss the larger picture.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
There's disharmony
in the person.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:84%
It may be a combination
of spiritual, emotional,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
intellectual, creative,
or cellular harmony

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:90%
that is out of balance.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a case of
patients with diabetes,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.780 align:middle line:84%
it's a self-destruction process
of life not being sweet enough.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
They're not being good enough--

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
that they will never make
it, or their parents--

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.802 align:middle line:90%
or make them average.

00:12:36.802 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of thing like
when a student comes home

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
with a report card
with four A's and a B.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And the parents spend all
the time talking about,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
well, how the heck did
you get a stupid B?

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.283 align:middle line:84%
Without ever mentioning the
fact that they did the four A's.

00:12:50.283 --> 00:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The parents'
intention, of course,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:90%
is, well, you could do better.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But by saying that, what they
really emphasized to this child

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:90%
is not good enough.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Almost inevitably, go
back into their history,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
and you will find that they came
from developmental situations

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that compromised them
and disempowered them

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:84%
with limiting beliefs
that were programmed

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:90%
into their subconscious mind.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
As they got older, not even
knowing the subconscious

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
mind was there, not
even knowing that it's

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
working 95% of the day, from
their little narrow conscious

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.025 align:middle line:84%
view looking at the
world, they're a victim.

00:13:27.025 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I have all the great intentions,
so I don't know why I'm sick.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And the issue is,
can I change it?

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:90%
Not by the conscious mind alone.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
You need something to push
it into the subconscious mind

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
source of the problem.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So until you examine the
interconnectedness of all these

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
different things and realize
we're not dealing with nouns--

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
see, as you approach your
topic, this is diabetes.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, 50 people, tell me
how you treat diabetes?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to do
any good to anybody.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Look at it as a verb not a noun.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
As a verb, you
don't have diabetes.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.390 align:middle line:90%
You're diabetesing, all right?

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:90%
You're processing.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And processes can be changed.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had thousands of
patients come in taking

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:84%
the diabetic drug and
systematically get off of it

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:90%
very quickly--

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.930 align:middle line:90%
never to have it used again.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Diabetes is reversible.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I personally helped
countless numbers of people

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.210 align:middle line:84%
improve the quality
of their life

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
to where they no longer
required insulin or had

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:90%
substantial reduction.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And as long as they
maintained healthy choices

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and surrendered
unhealthy choices,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:84%
they could reasonably expect to
maintain a normal blood sugar

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.710 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's not just
me that can do this.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:90%
It's anybody can do it.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know people
look inside their life

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and see the stuff that
they want, and they go out

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and get it.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you see that
you want to be healed,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.118 align:middle line:90%
you'll go out and get it.

00:15:04.118 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, when I see
something like this--

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's something so easy
and so affordable in a lot

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:90%
of ways--

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that you could turn
around somebody's life

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
where they're not
suddenly becoming--

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.147 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to live a lifetime

00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:18.105 align:middle line:90%
reliant on medications.

00:15:18.105 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why haven't
we done this before?

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Why hasn't the study
been done before?

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't people heard
about things like this?

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a friend of
mine who is diabetic.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:90%
I sent him to the website.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, how's
this possible?

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
He's been type 1
diabetic for years.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it hit him
when he was 12 or 13,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in that range.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's about my age
now, like, 35, 36.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.165 align:middle line:90%
And I showed him the trailer.

00:15:39.165 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And he's like,
that's impossible.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.345 align:middle line:90%
And he says, you know what?

00:15:42.345 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I guess I'm going to go raw.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try it out.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:90%
And so he went raw.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how many
weeks it was that he went by,

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
but basically everything
became so balanced and even.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The numbers dropped and he
became completely regulated.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.713 align:middle line:84%
And when he talked
to his doctor--

00:16:01.713 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
he basically talked to
his doctor on the phone

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:90%
and said here's what I'm doing.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.287 align:middle line:84%
The doctor's like,
oh that doesn't work.

00:16:06.287 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't do that.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:90%
But he saw his numbers change.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.092 align:middle line:84%
And he saw himself feeling
better and got to the point

00:16:13.092 --> 00:16:14.550 align:middle line:84%
where he didn't
have to didn't have

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to do that over the course
of the day, which is--

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, it
brings back responsibility

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to the individual for
their health rather than

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:84%
the perception that they've been
provided over years and years

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and years that they're
more or less victims.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And they're frail biochemical
devices where everything

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:90%
out there could destroy them.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this
is so incorrect.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people, if their
mind isn't right,

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:84%
they can have this
microbiotic diet,

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:90%
they could eat the raw food.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.650 align:middle line:84%
If their mind isn't right,
that's the weak point.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that the
food alone will do it,

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:84%
but the food with the
mind together will do it.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.200 align:middle line:90%
