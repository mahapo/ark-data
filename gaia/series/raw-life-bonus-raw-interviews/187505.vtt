>>BRUCE LIPTON: If toxic
substances come into the body,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.670 align:middle line:84%
if they're allowed
into the body,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:84%
they interfere with the
propagation of signals

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:84%
because signals are carried
by, many times, chemical

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:90%
and electrochemical pathways.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And if I have toxins
in the system,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:90%
the toxins distort the signal.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And the distorted signal
derives a distorted result.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, yes,
toxins interfere

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
with the ability of
the system to stay

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:90%
in balance in homeostasis.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MICHAEL BECKWITH: Detox is
very difficult for people.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
shift your way of life,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.500 align:middle line:84%
all of those old patterns
and all of the chemicals

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that are in the cells themselves
that begin to be released,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
as it begin to be
transmitted, person

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
has to be very strong,
very courageous,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and have strong intention to
move through that process.

>>DAVID WOLFE:
Getting the gunk out,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:90%
it's like stirring up the mud.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to cause people
to have high energy then

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.132 align:middle line:90%
low energy.

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cause stuff
to come out of their pores.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cause stuff
to come out of their mouth.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cause
all kinds of what we

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:90%
call detoxification episodes.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.963 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
rough sometimes,

00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's a good thing.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I think once you really
get on the natural food,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and you have a little bit
of education around it,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
you realize that it's not the
food that's doing it to you.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
It's your body saying, time
to get out the garbage now

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.883 align:middle line:90%
we have enough energy.

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the right
kind of nutrients.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we have enough fiber,
whatever, minerals to get out

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.667 align:middle line:90%
the stuff that's excess.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KARYN CALABRESE: Cleansing
and detoxifying our bodies,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe, is the
number one tool

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
for staying healthy,
young, and vibrant.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it has
anything to do necessarily

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
with the title of being a vegan
or raw foodist or a vegetarian.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I think all of those
things are wonderful,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're great things
to attain and to make

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:90%
our lives simpler and easier.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, to
make everything work,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
we must cleanse and
detoxify our bodies.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.048 align:middle line:84%
I've met many, many raw
foodists over the years that

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
don't look much healthier
than some of our meat eaters.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:90%
I've met many vegetarians.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:90%
I've met many raw foodists.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the health that
I enjoy continually for over 35

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:84%
years is because I have been
cleansing and detoxifying

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:90%
our bodies.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.942 align:middle line:84%
We could pretend that we
just have a little cell.

00:02:25.942 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know we have billions
and billions of cells.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we build up
layer and layer of toxicity

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:84%
over the years because
our bodies weren't meant

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to assimilate 99% of
what most people are

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:90%
putting in their bodies.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
But this marvelous
machine goes, OK, I'm

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:90%
going to do the best I can.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It takes it in, but
it has to take away

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
from the other processes of
the body regenerating itself.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you cleanse
and detoxify,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
you start to break down
the layers of toxicity

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
that you're building up.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
be eating improper foods

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.140 align:middle line:84%
to do that-- just
driving around in a car.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:90%
You're driving behind buses.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I get my clothes dry cleaned.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I eat what some people
would call perfectly.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I cleanse and detoxify my
body a minimum of four times

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:90%
a year.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> MORGAN SPURLOCK: Right after
we finish "Super Size Me,"

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.735 align:middle line:84%
we were still shooting, but
it was right after I finished

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
doing the diet
myself for 30 days.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
My wife, Alex, put me on a
detox diet, a vegan detox,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
where basically she
cut out all caffeine,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
all sugar, all processed foods.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.640 align:middle line:84%
It was basically all whole
fruits and vegetables,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
whole grains.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
with additives.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing that
wasn't somehow based

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
on a natural product.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:90%
And I did this for eight weeks.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.223 align:middle line:84%
And over the first
few days, I mean,

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.640 align:middle line:84%
I felt myself going through
massive withdrawal like a drug

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
addict.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:90%
I had massive headaches.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:90%
My head was pounding like crazy.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I started sweating
after a couple days.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:90%
I started getting the shakes.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it was.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It was like going
through withdrawal.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.813 align:middle line:84%
And it lasted-- it was
almost exactly three days

00:03:55.813 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:84%
until I kind of
had a breakthrough

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
started to kind of feel

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:90%
a little bit better.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.510 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, but that was it.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I went cold turkey
on everything.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just a few things.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.825 align:middle line:84%
And I think that my body
was reeling from it.

00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LILLIAN MULLER: When you
go on a fruitarian diet,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:12.750 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like--

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I call it a camouflaged fast
and because fruit is like--

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
it's so cleansing
and so detoxifying.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And you just like getting rid of
poison and junk and everything

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:84%
that's accumulated
for all my 27 years.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
I was like getting rid
of so much so quickly.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And though Gene
Stanley had told me

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:84%
about the possible
elimination crisis,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I was not really prepared
and then those things happen.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that I will
get a lot of dizzy spells.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one time I was on
the freeway and driving up 405

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden dizzy
spells and panicky and my heart

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:90%
was beating really fast.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what was happening.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was getting into
an elimination moment.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>ANGELA STOKES: When
you start to detox,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a really nice idea to
be gentle with yourself--

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
get a lot of sleep,
get a lot of rest.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do any of that stuff.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I was so out of
connection with this body.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was so used to pushing
this body all the time,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
that that's the situation
I created for myself.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
In my first week of
going 100% raw vegan,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I was on an adventure trip
in the north of Iceland.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:90%
I was white water rafting.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I was up sailing I
was horse riding.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I was like maybe 300
pounds and detoxing

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:90%
at like a phenomenal rate.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:90%
So that was an interesting one.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thought I'd gone crazy,
first off-- or the other people

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was with because
like I explained,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I was the person who's
eating three plates of pasta

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:90%
for lunch.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
There was never one
of anything for me.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:90%
It was always masses of food.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
there I was on this trip

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
with a bag with just fruits
and vegetables and nuts

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and seeds and oils and seaweed.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
>> This was after abusing
myself nonstop for 30 days

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
on McDonald's.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the
detox diet, my cholesterol

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.697 align:middle line:90%
had gone back to normal.

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
My blood pressure
gone back to normal.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.988 align:middle line:84%
My liver function had
returned to normal.

00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:13.492 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.492 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the question was,
well, how much of that

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:90%
was just going on this diet?

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And how much of it was getting
rid of all that other crap

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that I was shoveling
into my pie hole?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ANTHONY ROBBINS:
Energy is life.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I talk to people all the time.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
people will talk about

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
is all things they want
to do in their life,

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
but they feel too tired or
too exhausted to burnout

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.160 align:middle line:90%
or too stressed.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I say to
them is start with your body.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Its physiology first.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
You make a change in
your physical body;

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that change your
mental, emotional, spiritual

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:90%
aspect of your life.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.045 align:middle line:84%
So I went initially on
just an absolute cleanse.

00:06:45.045 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:90%
I went on a 10-day cleanse.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.633 align:middle line:84%
I was going to do
just watermelon.

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I didn't
quite do that,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.758 align:middle line:84%
but I did it for about
six or seven days.

00:06:50.758 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's been
on a fast knows

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that the first two or
three days are hell,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you have more energy
than when you're eating.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:90%
It's bizarre.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.958 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin to realize,
wait, food is a source of fuel,

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
but it's not the
only source of fuel.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Why do you wake up in the
morning filled with energy?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you can give yourself
something that is alive,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:90%
you tend to feel more alive.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember, I had learned
to always drive my car.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And always at home, I
have a lot of bananas--

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
like bananas at
different stages,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:84%
because they are known to slow
down the elimination process

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
when that happens
really extreme.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you take bananas
when you're eliminating,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
this lightheaded

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:84%
spells, and also if you can
combine that with lying down

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and lift up your leg higher
than your head, and of course,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
breathing slowly, breathing
leading slowly, and relaxing

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and thinking spiritual
thoughts and praying.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was doing.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I would lie down in my
car, and it would take,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, 15,
20, 30 minutes.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.145 align:middle line:84%
I'd sit down on the
side of the freeway.

00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And people are
looking what I was

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.895 align:middle line:84%
doing because I
was sitting down,

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
lying down in the back seat
with my feet planted up

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:90%
on the seat in front of me.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And always, like clockwork,
that would work for me--

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
the deep breathing, the bananas,
and relaxing, and praying,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and my elimination would
always slow down with that.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But for me, I think that
I felt better after doing her

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:90%
detox diet.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, for a
few weeks a year, usually

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:84%
for two or three
weeks, sometimes four--

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.057 align:middle line:84%
I've haven't done the full eight
weeks since I did the movie--

00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
but I'll go for like two
to three weeks, sometimes

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:84%
four weeks and just detox
out, get rid of sugar,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
not drink caffeine, cut meat
out of my diet or something

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:90%
for an extended period of time.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GARY NULL: Anytime you
take a person off a very

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy regimen, they're
going to feel better

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:84%
for four or five days through
the detoxing and rebalancing

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
They will go through mood swings
and energy swings, blood sugar

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
swings, or
biochemistry shifting.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But a real detox takes about
two years, not two days

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
or two weeks.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
A real detox, you're
not going to do

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:84%
but some bentonite clay
and some lemon and apple

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:90%
cider vinegar juice.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The cells have chromosomes and
telomeres, the aging clock.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
When those cells have been
damaged, everything speeds up.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:84%
You're speeding up
your aging clock.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It's repairing the
damage to the DNA

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that is necessary to
reverse the disease process.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because our bodies are
in a self-regenerating mode,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
we have a God force flowing
through all of us of healing.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
If you cut your finger
and you do nothing to it,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.260 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it heal up?

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The entire body was
designed to do that.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And all of your challenges,
from diabetes to cancer

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to Crohn's disease, these are
just the bodies screaming,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I have too much toxicity.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I need a way to show
you to make a change.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, in
our world, we're

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
taught to compartmentalize the
body and work on specific areas

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of chemicals.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
While I certainly would
never tell anybody

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to not go to a doctor or
not to do something that's

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
comfortable for them,
what I do stress

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
is educate yourself
and try detoxifying.

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.307 align:middle line:84%
I've been interviewed
many times over the years,

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and they always say to me,
how do you know this is true,

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Karyn?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't have any type
of scientific background.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And my general
answer is to try it.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Try it for one week.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Cause and effect, there's
no way it can't work.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.230 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
You can give me a million
scientific reasons

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:90%
of why it may not work.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it, the
body is designed to work.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to
regenerate itself.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're meant to do.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Whenever you
change your life,

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
there's some kind of detox
that's going to happen.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
We have strong coping
mechanisms, defense mechanisms,

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:84%
compulsive behaviors that we've
developed make it through life.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you change your life,
all of those are challenged.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
You think those
are your friends.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, maybe
years ago they

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.265 align:middle line:84%
were your friends
to help you make it

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:55.890 align:middle line:84%
through a particular
time in your life.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:90%
But now they hinder the process.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not hard to
figure out that a watermelon

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and a steak are going to break
down but a little different

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:90%
impact on your body.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying you
go eat watermelon only.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But if the more you can
put yourself in a position

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
where you're taking
in 70%, let's

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
say water content
foods, alive foods,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to feel that
affect at two levels.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Your body will start to
cleanse because it has energy.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.535 align:middle line:84%
It's not being used up
because we use so much energy

00:11:22.535 --> 00:11:24.438 align:middle line:90%
up just in digestion.

00:11:24.438 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Food's supposed to digest
in three or four hours.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.563 align:middle line:84%
And for many people, it's
digesting seven or eight

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:84%
hours because we so
overload the system.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And we don't just overload
it with the amount of food,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.465 align:middle line:84%
we overloaded with
coffees and soda

00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
pops and all these other
drinks that the body's got

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.882 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how to deal with.

00:11:37.882 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So common sense says if you want
to be alive, eat live foods.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KARYN: I'm a big proponent
of cleansing the body,

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:90%
detoxifying.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe that
there is only one method.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are many roads
to the top of the mountain.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.010 align:middle line:84%
It's finding what
resonates for you.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So people say to me
all the time, well,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
which one is the
best one, Karyn?

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Is yours the best?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Is this one the best?

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.083 align:middle line:90%
Is that the best?

00:11:58.083 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:90%
You know the best one?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:90%
The one you'll do.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The one that resonates with
you, the one that you'll do,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and the one where the person
teaching is resonating

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
with what you need to
learn for yourself.
