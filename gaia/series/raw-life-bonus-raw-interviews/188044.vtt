00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Raw food is the best way
to have the cleanest energy.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like we take so much
care about what kind of fuel

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.150 align:middle line:84%
we put in our car, what kind of
oil, this, that, and the other,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:84%
like our car we really
care about sometimes

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:84%
more than the fuel
that we're looking

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
at putting in our bodies.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:90%
It's cleaner burning fuel.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:84%
>> A life food cuisine and
lifestyle is a powerful way

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.065 align:middle line:84%
to heal both yourself,
the ecology of the planet,

00:00:38.065 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
of the planet.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The government has a
lot to do with our beliefs.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.065 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are pretty well
controlling what we're told.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the American Dairy
Association, the American Meat

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Packers Association.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they pretty
well tell you

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that you have to have
animal products to survive.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And this just is not the truth.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> How can you think, logically,
that eating a dead animal can

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
make you healthy, or
to prolong your life,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
or to make you beautiful,
or to give you energy?

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:90%
How can you think?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
people's logic for this.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.778 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, I've got to
have meat, protein.

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:90%
It's so high in protein."

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but the body is
paying such a high price

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
by you eating this flesh.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.156 align:middle line:84%
Uric acid, cholesterol, worms,
fish, too, chicken and turkey.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
They're all the
same stuff, right?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And also when the
animal is slaughtered,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
you know that adrenaline fear
that goes through the animal?

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't think
that the animal is

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
knowing when it's gonna get
killed in the butcher house?

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It knows for sure,
I am positive.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat it, you
don't get just the cholesterol

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
that clogs your arteries,
the uric acid, the fat,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:90%
the dead blood.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes meat is
sold, and they color it,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and they put nitrates in it
to look like fresh pink meat.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
It should be gray, if they
didn't do the preservatives

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But the adrenaline
poisoning and all that crap

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:84%
you're taking in there
just to get some protein?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
When you can go to
the plant world?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Raw nuts, avocados,
grain, sprouted grains?

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I truly believe that it's not
a natural human instinct to eat

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.240 align:middle line:90%
dead flesh.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.227 align:middle line:90%
It is a learned experience.

00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
If you were on a
desert island and you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
hadn't eaten in weeks
and weeks and weeks,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and there was a dead cow
floated up on the island

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and you had a bushel
of apples, where

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
do you think your
instincts would take you?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
If we see a dying,
sick animal, it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
isn't our response to
pounce on it and eat it.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It's to maybe take it to
a vet, at the simple worst

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:90%
to step over it.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But it isn't to pounce
on it and eat it.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
My carnivorous dog, it
is his natural instinct

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:90%
to eat dead flesh.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think this myth
that we live with,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that we need protein
for strong bones

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and to build teeth and hair,
it's exactly what it is.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And we've bought into it.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Teachers in school
get information

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.300 align:middle line:84%
from the big companies to
teach you what you should eat,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:90%
that you need the food pyramid.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, to a degree,
they are expanding this.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
They are adding more and
more fruits and vegetables,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
because people are realizing
that they feel better.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Even the American
Cancer Society says

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
that you shouldn't be
eating so much red meat.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Why kill an animal
so I can enjoy my meal?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's like
a murderous thing.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I didn't pay the
butcher to buy a piece of steak

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600 align:middle line:84%
or a piece of chicken or turkey,
if I didn't pay that money

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.738 align:middle line:84%
to get that food
in the first place,

00:03:21.738 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
there wouldn't be the
demand on the butcher

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:90%
to kill that animal.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take
personal responsibility.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We've turned our
back on local produce,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
and we've turned our back on
local farmers and local people,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
who use the community and
rely on the community to make

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
a living, because of the
convenience of a chain store.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
We go to those
places just because I

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
can take care of all my
shopping needs in one place.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
My brother, who is the
biggest, cheapest human being

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the Earth, and
I love him more than anybody,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.133 align:middle line:84%
he'll go to seven
stores when he shops,

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
just because he will go wherever
he can get the best deal.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And he'll go to one place,
and it's like, well,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.395 align:middle line:84%
why would I buy
tangerines there?

00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:02.103 align:middle line:84%
Because over here,
you know what, they're

00:04:02.103 --> 00:04:03.165 align:middle line:90%
a nickel cheaper a pound.

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And he'll go to
all these places.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And especially
during the summer,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
he'll go to the farmer's market
and just buy those things

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
that he could buy at a grocery
store from the local farmers,

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because he knows that he's
supporting his local economy.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
He's supporting
people whose money

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is gonna go right back
into his own economy.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I think that's the
biggest thing that we should

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:84%
start to look at, things
that are grown naturally,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
things that are grown
in your backyard.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I think we've become so
distanced from our food

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.328 align:middle line:84%
that we've lost sight
of what real food is.

00:04:30.328 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'll never
forget an incident.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I was at a party
that I had catered,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and they asked me to
speak a little bit

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.203 align:middle line:84%
about my food, which was a raw
food diet that I had catered.

00:04:39.203 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And there were a bunch
of doctors there,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and they had brought
in two nutritionists

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:90%
to speak about health.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
travesties was,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
someone asked one of
the nutritionists,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is there a difference between
organic and non-organic?

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And the nutritionist
says, governments studies

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:84%
have shown that
there is absolutely

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
no difference between
organic and non-organic.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how can you say this?

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows now there's a--
you can go to a farmer's market

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and pick up a strawberry
and even taste a difference.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
You can see a difference.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But government
controlled licensing says

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:90%
that there is no difference.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
people, because of all

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
of the toxicity in their
bodies, they're asleep.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't stop and think
that this doesn't compute,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:90%
that this doesn't make sense.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is,
the best thing to do

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
is arm yourself with
as much education

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:middle line:84%
as you can on every
chance that you can,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:84%
because we spend a lot
of time on our education,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and to learn about our cars,
to learn about our occupations,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
but what about this
most magnificent mission

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
you'll ever be given?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.032 align:middle line:84%
Spend your time educating
yourself about the body.

00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
How many people knew
the stomach was just

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.970 align:middle line:90%
a tiny little snack in there?

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We think of it as
this whole area

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
to fill up three,
four times a day.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.320 align:middle line:84%
If we educate ourselves and
then we detox and cleanse,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
because that detoxing
and cleansing,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll come back to that, it's
these layers of toxicity

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that are closing our minds,
that are putting us to sleep,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't look at the
reality of what's being said.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So we just take on
this information, yeah,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:90%
we sleepwalk through life.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And then as we get sick,
we sleepwalk even further.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, wake up.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a cook, and I
think it was Jamie Oliver.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.758 align:middle line:84%
I can remember who
it was, but I'm

00:06:17.758 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
thinking it was Jamie Oliver in
the UK, went into a classroom

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:90%
with kids and blindfolded them.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm gonna have
you guys smell some things.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what they are.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.207 align:middle line:84%
So he blindfolds the kids,
and the one kid smells it

00:06:30.207 --> 00:06:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and he goes, it's hand soap.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.340 align:middle line:90%
He goes, it's hand soap.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It's what you wash
your hands with.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.045 align:middle line:84%
And the other kid
goes, no, no, no, no.

00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:90%
It's dishwashing liquid.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.603 align:middle line:84%
It's what you put in the
dishwasher to wash your dishes.

00:06:41.603 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And they take the blindfold off,
and the kids are sitting there,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:90%
staring at a lemon.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we associate
these things with now,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
these odors, these things
that are food and products

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:90%
are now byproducts.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:90%
And it starts in the home.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:90%
It starts with parents.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
It starts with what you
pass down to your kids.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a house where
my parents, my mother

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.302 align:middle line:90%
cooked dinner every single day.

00:07:03.302 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
There was not a
day-- my mother, it

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.385 align:middle line:84%
wasn't like she was
a stay at home mom.

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
She worked all day,
and she came home

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and she cooked dinner,
because it was important.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It was important to
build this ritual

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
of the family sitting down
and having a meal together.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
one of those things

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
that is so important for
families to understand,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
especially kids
to see, that food

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
matters, to understand
where food comes from.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.432 align:middle line:84%
We had a garden in our
backyard every summer.

00:07:27.432 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
For as long as I can
remember, as a little kid,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd be out there,
playing in the dirt,

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
pulling carrots out of the
ground and washing them off,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and eating them fresh
out of the ground.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Celery, cucumbers, tomatoes,
green beans, cabbage, lettuce.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.485 align:middle line:90%
We grew everything.

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:90%
We grew so much food.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we would can it
and have it in the winter.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.343 align:middle line:84%
I had such a great relationship
with food growing up.

00:07:51.343 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
that's completely

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:90%
distanced from everyone.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
we don't have time,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
or we don't have money, or
it's just not that important.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
there's a backlash now.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there
is a turn of the tide,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:84%
where people are realizing,
you know what, it is important,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and we are missing this
element of our lives.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, it
will come back.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Between the food industry,
and the drug industry,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and the medical industry,
they're very successful.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:84%
They're spending
their money wisely,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and they're businesses out
to sell their products,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're winning over
the minds of Americans

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.642 align:middle line:84%
to think that we're
actually doing better

00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
by spending all this money
on health care and drugs.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, even
the science the doctors

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.049 align:middle line:84%
are learning in the medical
journals is not accurate.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
That's even biased
in favor of drugs,

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
because the science is produced
and written and drawn up

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:84%
by the money, by the people
who are selling the drugs.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a difficult
thing we're going through,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and I think that we're coming
to a certain crisis in America,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
because health care
costs have skyrocketed

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.628 align:middle line:84%
to the degree that's businesses
can't function anymore.

00:08:58.628 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And drugs are getting
more expensive,

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're not
seeing the benefits.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:90%
We're not seeing it.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.083 align:middle line:84%
We're spending more and
more money on health care,

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
but we're not seeing a
healthy population for it.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.922 align:middle line:84%
So people are starting
to smarten up.

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.583 align:middle line:84%
They're starting
to say, well, maybe

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:84%
this is all it's
cracked up to be,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.333 align:middle line:90%
just taking more and more drugs.

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.917 align:middle line:90%
Maybe drugs are not the answer.

00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
I think the way it's
coming around now

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
is, because I think they've
pushed the economic envelope

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.942 align:middle line:84%
almost too far,
and now people are

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
gonna start looking for other
means of reducing health care

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:90%
costs.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.597 align:middle line:84%
And that's where good
nutrition and proper lifestyle,

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even cleaning
up the environment

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
might be beneficial
for health costs.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
There might be a another
economic factor fighting

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
against this idea the
drugging of America

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is the answer to
our health problems.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:84%
There might be another
factor coming, too.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And they might be
coming to a conflict.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And we might see more effort,
more winning of people

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:84%
with nutrition, and
environmental concerns,

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and people actually looking to
remove the cause of disease,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
instead of just treating
people after they

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.418 align:middle line:84%
fall off the cliff
and land at the bottom

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and smash up their bodies.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We cannot get
around the inevitable.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually look
it right in the face.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And looking that
right in the face

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:84%
means we have to face the way
that our whole civilization is

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:84%
utilizing food and our
whole relationship to food.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the relationship
that we have with food

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual one.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And our relationship to
food right now is spiritual.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just not very
much spirit in it.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just how much is there?

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And right now, we're at like
1%, where it could be 100%.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.680 align:middle line:84%
All ancient cultures, especially
the great Incan civilizations,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Chinese civilizations, all
had a very deep correlation

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
with agriculture, spirituality,
health, longevity, and beauty.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:90%
These were all tied together.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
For whatever reason,
in our culture,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:90%
it's all been broken apart.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look
at that directly,

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
in order to get to the
bottom of this whole thing.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> We live in a culture which
tells us that the Earth belongs

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And when ownership is
implied, and then the idea

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
that we could do
whatever we want

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and not have to even consider
how would our actions

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
impact the others, whether they
be other animals, other plants,

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:90%
the water, the soil, the air.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
At first, it seems like
this is a great privilege.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the Earth belongs to me.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:90%
It is mine.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it
leads, of course,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to degradation of human
beings and the earth,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.200 align:middle line:84%
as we're seeing more and more
at this time of global crisis.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I think we could all agree
that we're at a global crisis.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
perhaps three things that

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
could be helpful in
considering this global crisis.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Number one, there
is a global crisis.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Number two, we're causing it.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:90%
We meaning human beings.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And number three
could be, most of us

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:84%
don't have a clue about
number one or number two.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And the situation that we
are finding ourselves in,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and the rise of obesity,
and diabetes, and cancer,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and depression, and
pharmaceutical drug use,

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and recreational
debilitating drug

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
use, and TV, which is another
form of debilitating drug use,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
you can look at it as we're
a culture of low self-esteem.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The average person in our
culture has low self-esteem.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
That is really the disease
we're talking about,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.590 align:middle line:90%
the disease of low self-esteem.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Where this all begins
is in our own heart.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
In sports, we used to say,
does that team have heart?

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Are we playing against
a team that has heart?

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we say, are we playing
against a team that has mind?

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.295 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
When we used to play
tennis, does that person

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:90%
have the heart to win?

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:90%
The heart is where your soul is.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
That's where you have
that ability to say,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I am going for it.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.377 align:middle line:84%
I am going to win
no matter what.

00:13:21.377 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make it
happen, no matter what.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's
not a win-loss thing.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not like if you
win, someone else loses.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a win-win thing.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:90%
If you win, everybody else wins.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
If you win, the
organic farmer wins.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
If you win, the organic
health food store wins.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:90%
If you win, you win.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
You get all the health
benefits, and your family wins.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:84%
If you win, all the
people around you,

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.940 align:middle line:90%
they win, all your friends.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
This is ultimately the
greatest win-win-win strategy

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
ever, is deciding inside
ourselves that we're

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.052 align:middle line:90%
worth it and we can do it.

00:13:52.052 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Nobody wants to
give up choices.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to
give up convenience.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So making convenient, knowing
where you can get food

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that you enjoy
like this, knowing

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
how to have things that are
on the run available to you,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.255 align:middle line:84%
so you don't get to
that threshold, where

00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I gotta have something
right now, that's how

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
you get yourself where
you have more balance.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
In the moment, it all comes
down to what do you value most?

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I always say to people, nothing
tastes as good as fit feels,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:90%
as energetic feels.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you get
associated with that,

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
then you start
making new choices.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we make that change?

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:90%
It's actually total easy.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It starts right
in your backyard.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:90%
It starts on your porch.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
It starts with
your house plants.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It gets back to loving
plants, loving the soil,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.993 align:middle line:84%
loving the earth,
giving back something

00:14:35.993 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
instead of just taking away.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, it starts at home.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When you begin to eat in
a way which connects you more

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
to the earth and
to your own self,

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
which a raw food
vegan diet does,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
you actually feel the effects
of it right away in a positive

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:90%
You feel more alive.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
You feel more grateful.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
You begin to wake up
to your own confidence,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:90%
your own at-easeness.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What could we eat that
would cause the least harm

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth and
all earthly beings?

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:90%
That's our main criteria.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Not what would make
me most healthy,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
not even what tastes best.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.140 align:middle line:84%
All those are secondary
considerations.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Our main consideration
is not harming others.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And so part of that
is not overconsuming.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
No matter what, whether you're
consuming lettuce beings

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:90%
or chicken beings, less is best.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> When you begin to
be more connected,

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to feel that
what you do actually matters,

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
not only to your own health and
well-being but to the greater

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.663 align:middle line:90%
world around you.

00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In the end, it's not
just about raw food or about

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:90%
biodiesel.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about a
sustainable lifestyle.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about waking up and
saying, hey, does this work

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.390 align:middle line:90%
or does it not work?

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not about good or bad.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's what works and
what doesn't work.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the more that we do that,
the more everyone does that,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:90%
it's gonna be a better world.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
It's gonna be a happier world.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're gonna be leaving a
much better world to our kids.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a train going a
million miles an hour towards

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
death, pain, fire, destruction,
famine, greed, hate.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's also another
train that you can get on.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
It's going another direction,
towards love, laughter,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:84%
happiness, joy, growth,
beauty, longevity.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And that choice is
always available.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:90%
You choose.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%
