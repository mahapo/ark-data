>>MORGAN SPURLOCK: We've lived
for so long where we kind of

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.750 align:middle line:90%
enjoy abusing our bodies.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.540 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Why do we want to
suddenly start taking the time

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to take care of it?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.940 align:middle line:90%
We drink.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.020 align:middle line:90%
We smoke.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:90%

I've been right in the
middle of it my whole life.

00:00:44.513 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
That's an outdated,
antiquated model of reality.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's led us into the
situation we have now.

I believe that the
definition of insanity

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
is doing the same things
over and over and over

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%

>>GABRIEL COUSENS: My career
in science and medicine

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
really started at
Amherst College where

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I published my first paper in
biochemistry and biophysics

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and then went on to Columbia
Medical School where I was also

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
doing biochemistry
research and began

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to really approach this
whole thing as a scientist.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
What I learned at
Columbia Medical School,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
which a great medical
school, was symptom focus.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Relieve the symptom with the
pharmacological approach.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And even though I was really
expert in pharmacology,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
for my biochemistry
background, I saw, wait,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
there's something
not right here.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.340 align:middle line:84%
How do we go to a
deeper level of healing?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And that took me into more
holistic healing before--

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:84%
this is in the '60s before many
people even heard the term,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:90%
including myself--

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.812 align:middle line:84%
but I just said,
as a scientist, I

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
have to see what
works that's going

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
to heal people permanently.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.352 align:middle line:84%
And that took me into training
people and educating people

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately creating the
Tree of Life Rejuvenation

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Center where we can create an
all encompassing environment

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
that people could really
get a taste of what

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.278 align:middle line:90%
it's like to really be healthy.

>>FRED BISCI: Most
of the people come

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:90%
to see me have health issues.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And how I handle
that, I make people

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:90%
aware of lifestyle changes.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I focus on lifestyle changes.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people to understand
that the human body has

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:90%
god-given remedial capabilities.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:90%
It has the ability to heal.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.330 align:middle line:84%
If you create the right
internal environment

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.510 align:middle line:84%
by leaving certain things
out of your lifestyle,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
your body will rise
to the occasions

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and can respond in a way
that some people think

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
would be exaggeration
or even quackery.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some miraculous
things happen in a very--

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the simplest of changes
in a person's lifestyle.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOEL FUHRMAN: And the body
is a miraculous, self-healing,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.175 align:middle line:90%
self-repairing machine.

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And what gets a
person well as you

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:90%
remove the causes of disease.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And the natural
tendency of the body

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
is to bring itself back to
normal if given the chance.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.557 align:middle line:84%
>>BRUCE LIPTON:
One of the leading

00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:84%
killers in United States
is cardiovascular disease.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that 90% or
more of cardiovascular disease

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
can be avoided by
changing lifestyle.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And cancer, which they've
always said was genetic,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
they never found really
any cancer genes.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And the fact, that it takes a
10 to 15 genes, a coordination

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of 10 to 15 specific genes,
to kick a cancer off,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:84%
the concept that this
is a random probability

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:90%
is not very likely either.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So that even the American
Cancer Society in the last year

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:90%
made this announcement.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:90%
The first time they made it--

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's still a
conservative estimate--

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
but they say 60%
or more of cancer

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
is totally avoidable
by changing lifestyle.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I can give you a pill to
lower your blood pressure

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:90%
or raise your blood pressure.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a pill
to make your heart beat

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
slower or heart beat
faster, to make you

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.478 align:middle line:90%
urinate more or urinate less.

00:04:08.478 --> 00:04:09.937 align:middle line:84%
We can go to the
health food store,

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and we can get an
herbal product that

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.792 align:middle line:84%
can make your heart beat
faster or make your heart beat

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
slower, to make you
tired, to wake you up

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:90%
or to put you to sleep.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But the efficacy of the
pharmacologic substance,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
whether natural or not, is
proportional to its toxicity.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.288 align:middle line:84%
They don't work because
they fix anything,

00:04:25.288 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
they work because
they're actually blocking

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
or interfere with the
natural body process.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Very often the
symptoms of disease

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
could be the body trying
to repair, rejuvenate,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and detoxify from
the cause of disease,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:90%
from the stresses on the body.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the leading causes of
our early death is eating food,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:90%
any kind of food.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is this--

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
is that in the byproducts
of digesting food

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:90%
are free radicals.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And the free radicals are
like the carbon monoxide

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.410 align:middle line:84%
that comes out the exhaust
pipe of a car as a byproduct

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:90%
of the car running.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:84%
As much as the carbon
monoxide can kill us,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:90%
the free radicals kill us.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JULIAN WHITAKER: I
had the opportunity

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
to work as a staff physician
for Nathan Pritikin.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Nathan Pritikin,
as you may know,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
houses patients and puts
them on a very low-M fat diet

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:90%
and strict exercise regimen.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was working
with him in 1976.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And what was so dramatic
as far as I was concerned,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
was at very early in my learning
and practicing and medicine,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
when I was working for
Pritikin, I saw people get well.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Traditionally-trained
physicians don't often

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:90%
see people get well.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:90%
They often see them get better.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:84%
In some areas, for instance, in
orthopedics, you set the bone.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:84%
It heals and the
patient is well.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
dealing with diseases,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:90%
you don't see people get well.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you go from
one drug to another drug

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.330 align:middle line:84%
to a plethora of drugs
to multiple drugs.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And so people really
don't get well

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
if they're going up this scale
of pharmaceutical intervention

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.805 align:middle line:90%
for symptoms of disease.

00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:09.570 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Both at Pritikin and
also here Whitaker

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Wellness, we see people come
off a drug, come off a drug,

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:84%
come off a drug not because they
have this philosophical rage

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
against drugs, but simply
because the reason for the drug

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:90%
has been eliminated.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.308 align:middle line:90%
That would be wellness.

00:06:25.308 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of a sudden, we're
starting to see that these

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
diseases that seem to
be manifesting through

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
the population, where we
attributed them to genetics

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and biochemistry, really
turn out to be all connected

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to lifestyle and how we
respond to the stimuli of life.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And by reprogramming
that, we are empowered

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.285 align:middle line:90%
to change the biology as well.

>>KARYN CALABRESE:
Early on in my life,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I had a standard American
diet, a very typical diet.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.620 align:middle line:90%
I was very sickly.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I was cloudy in my focus.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:90%
I had terrible skin, PMS.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I had the worst
constipation on the planet,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:90%
and I was miserable.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I
gradually evolved

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
because I do believe that
you don't necessarily

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:90%
go from A to Z overnight.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And as I evolved and
changed, my health improved,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.740 align:middle line:84%
my vitality improved, and
my lifestyle absolutely

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:90%
improved 100%.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.103 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't only that I didn't
gain weight or gain wrinkles

00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that other women in
my age are going to,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:90%
that it's the clarity.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:90%
It's the focus.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I sleep three and a
half, four hours a night.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
I run five to six businesses.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm never tired.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm never sick.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I like to think I'm
always pleasant and loving

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:90%
towards people.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just a totally
different way.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can certainly
say this was not

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:90%
what I enjoyed my entire life--

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
coming to this whole change
of how I think, how I feel,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:90%
how I eat.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
My lifestyle changing
has changed everything

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
around me and the
people around me, too,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:84%
which goes to prove, if you
make yourself number one,

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
if you make the positive
changes for yourself, which

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
is the only thing we'll
ever be given control over,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.650 align:middle line:84%
it spreads out to
everything around you.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Suffering is the most
powerful agent of change there

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
suffering on the planet.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Because until
someone is suffering,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:90%
they won't change anything.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:90%
They won't move.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:90%
They won't do anything.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.580 align:middle line:84%
But when pain is present,
they're going to move.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
They're going to open
up to different ideas.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say, hey,
maybe this whole thing

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.940 align:middle line:90%
I've been doing is all wrong.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I need to do that.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I look at suffering
as a good thing.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the dynamic
of balance in our universe,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.924 align:middle line:90%
the balance of opposites.

00:08:38.924 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GARY NULL: Disease cannot
exist where there is balance.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Where there is balance, there
is a sense of a person being

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:90%
at ease.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
When a person releases their
sense of ease by the choices

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.090 align:middle line:84%
they make-- they have the soft
drink or coffee or the refined

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates, or they
refuse to exercise,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:84%
or they act out in an
inappropriate manner,

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
they either don't express or
over express or exaggerate

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:84%
an expression, what's causing
their angst, they build a rage,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:84%
or they repress everything and
go into a sense of despondency

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:90%
and depression.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:84%
All of that, every
second, 24 hours a day,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is causing hormonal
fluctuations.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And the hormone fluctuations
directly leads to a person

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
having been physiological
changes in their blood

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:90%
chemistry and in their body.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Every time you get
stressed, cortisol goes up.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
When cortisol goes up,
then insulin goes up

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and so you have insulin
cortisol and all

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
these different biological
markers cascading up or down

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
depending upon whether you're
in a good mood or a bad mood.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BRENDAN BRAZIER:
Food creates stress

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
if it creates a lot of
work for itself to digest,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, cortisol,
the stress hormone goes up.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And when cortisol's
high, your body actually

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
can't get into your
state pays a sleep.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:90%
It's called delta.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, you're
not regenerating your body

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
during night.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.957 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up, you
feel tired because you

00:10:11.957 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:90%
haven't slept efficiently.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
that happens is

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.910 align:middle line:84%
people crave coffee
and sugar because that

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.270 align:middle line:90%
stimulates the adrenal glands.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
It gets you going, but
it's just false energy.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
What you really want to try
and do is reduce stress.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.443 align:middle line:84%
And a large part of that can be
done through better nutrition,

00:10:26.443 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:90%
through raw foods.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Conventional medicine is
based on Newtonian physics,

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:84%
which is everything is matter
is relevant and everything not

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:90%
material is not relevant.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is totally
incorrect because we

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
live in a quantum mechanical
universe which everything

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:90%
is energy, including matter.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And invisible forces actually
give shape to matter.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics
comes in and reveals

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that the mind is more
powerful in shaping matter

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a body like a
vehicle, but there's a driver.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And the driver is
separate from the vehicle.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But how the driver
drives the vehicle

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.990 align:middle line:84%
determines how well the
vehicle maintains itself

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.897 align:middle line:90%
and whether it stays healthy.

00:11:09.897 --> 00:11:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine
treats the body as a vehicle

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:90%
without a driver.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.518 align:middle line:84%
It's like a programmed machine,
like genetic programming.

00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So if there's something
wrong, then we say,

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
oh, the programming is off,
and the chemistry is off,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and we have to fix it.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But they ignore the role
of the mind of the driver

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
because the mind can
change the genetic activity

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.332 align:middle line:90%
and rewrite the genes.

00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's been left
out of the equation.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.210 align:middle line:84%
You put that back in, and we
mix the energy and the matter

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
back together again and
make a hole out of it.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're either going to
choose to stay uninformed

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and a victim, in which case,
help me, is today Tuesday?

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me put on my merit badge.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm in pain today.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:90%
I suffer, hand me a Twinkie.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Or you'll say, enough of this.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:90%
This is enough.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for my own life.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Turn it on.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to be responsible
for my own life.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to examine
the consequence

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:90%
of each choice I make.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to look ahead and
ask myself, everything in life

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:90%
is an exchange.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing we do
is an exchange of energy.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So if today when I
wake up, if I exchange

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that big, fat-laden
cheeseburger or the bacon

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and sausages and the
sugar-coated syrup,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and if I exchange that instead
for a nice, healthy protein

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
drink with some berries
in it and a good walk

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.987 align:middle line:84%
and a nice, positive thought,
an affirmation for the day,

00:12:40.987 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
then there's going to
be an outcome that I'm

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:90%
going to be happy with.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MIKE ADAMS: I've
seen amazing results

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
in people who turn to a raw
foods diet or partial raw foods

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people overcome
cancer, diabetes, heart

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:90%
disease, depression.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people throw out
their antidepressant drugs

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
after doing raw foods for
just three or four weeks.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It's really that powerful.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the medicine
that your body craves.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:90%
This is what balances your body.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.860 align:middle line:84%
In your DNA, you have a
blueprint for healing.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
really is activate it.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And to activate it,
you need to wake it up

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.350 align:middle line:84%
with those signals
from natural medicines.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
All those phytochemicals
from plants, those

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:90%
go into your body.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
They circulate to your
cells, tissues, and organs,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and they activate that healing
potential from the inside out.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you're not just
masking symptoms anymore.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
controlling blood sugar

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:90%
or managing disease.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you're doing
something far more powerful.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:84%
You're actually healing
from the inside out.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You're actually curing
disease and preventing disease

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
from ever spreading
in your body again.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the power of raw foods.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that
from cooked foods.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that
from pharmaceuticals.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
You only get that from
nature, living nature.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Live, raw foods gives you
that kind of potential.
