00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>> If we want to be alive, we
must eat foods that are alive.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.300 align:middle line:84%
If we want to be
dead, eat dead foods.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It's really as simple as that.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to find dead foods
out there-- anything that's

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
processed, that's refined,
that's hydrogenated,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.890 align:middle line:84%
irradiated, pasteurized,
cooked, fried.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's exposed to
high heat is a dead food.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat enough
of that, you're

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:84%
going to accelerate
your own death too.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Raw foods are all about
reversing that, or extending

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
your life, and enhancing
the quality of your life

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:84%
by taking in those foods that
your body was meant to ingest.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why raw foods
are so powerful.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why I make
them part of my diet,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and I really promote them
to everyone else who's

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:90%
interested in lifelong health.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Because raw foods are
the natural medicine

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
your body needs.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>> The body is designed to work.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to
regenerate itself.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're meant to do.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You get new cells
every seven years.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
You get new tissue
every three months.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:84%
The body is in an ongoing
cycle of regeneration.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it regenerating?

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It isn't getting the
materials to do it--

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:84%
enzymes, oxygen, and usable
nutrients for the body.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.208 align:middle line:84%
>> The live food protocol,
which is a way of life

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and a lifestyle, because
it isn't just live food.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
It's exercise, it's
yoga, it's meditation.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole lifestyle,
the whole energy,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:90%
creates an anti-aging effect.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand
that diabetes is

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:90%
an accelerated aging process.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Your arteries
degenerate, your heart

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:84%
degenerates, your nervous
system degenerates,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:90%
your brain degenerates.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And what you see,
which is miraculous,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:90%
is people are regenerating.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We've turned on the
anti-aging gene, which

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
is the basic theory of the
whole thing why this works,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and they've upgraded
their genetic expression,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.276 align:middle line:90%
and you're getting younger.

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
When you're getting younger,
you're reversing the process,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're coming of
all your medications,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.622 align:middle line:84%
because you don't need
'em, because they're

00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:90%
for degeneration.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of it.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Who doesn't want to look
and feel as good as possible?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Why have expensive plastic
surgery, when eating raw can

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:90%
give you fantastic results?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Just take a look at
Playboy playmate Lillian

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:90%
Muller at age 55.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:84%
She looks like she's
ready to do another cover.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Lillian Muller.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I am from Norway.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:90%
I grew up on a farm.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I was a typical farm
girl from Norway, really.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And I did not get into
veganism or vegetarianism

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:90%
until I came to America.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:90%
I became a vegan at 27.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I was the runner-up
Miss Norway at 18.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.770 align:middle line:90%
That's how it started.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I became a model in
London in my early 20s.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I was the Page Three
girl in the London Sun.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Then Playboy saw me.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I was 24.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I got an offer
to come to America

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.395 align:middle line:90%
and become the centerfold.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The first year in America I
lived at the Playboy Mansion.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.902 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Hefner was my
first boyfriend here.

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And since I was Hugh
Hefner's girlfriend,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I was allowed to go in there.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd take a chair and sit in
this refrigerator and just eat,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I came from very
simple circumstances and all.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.050 align:middle line:90%
We were quite poor actually.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had never seen, you
know, big buckets of crab legs

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.170 align:middle line:84%
and boiled eggs in trays
and whole grilled chickens

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:90%
and filet mignon and salmon.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So I gained 12
pounds in six weeks.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was not a
very healthy person.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But I became
Playmate of the Year.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:90%
I had a big-time career.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I started working in
American television.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And Hugh Hefner and I split
up after that first year.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I
was studying voice

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and acting in Hollywood Hills
with a very, very interesting

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:90%
woman called Laura Hart.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And one day she said to
me, I can't teach you

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
collect your thoughts.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:90%
You can't concentrate.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:90%
You're always depressed.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:84%
You seem to be anxiety-ridden,
and always worried

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:90%
about your weight.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, my fingers
would always swell up.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was anemic.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.858 align:middle line:90%
I used to pass out all the time.

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you'd
better go and see

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine
called Gene Stanley.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
And I studied the
following year with

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
this wonderful holistic
doctor called Gene Stanley.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.930 align:middle line:84%
That year I became a
fruitarian actually.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:90%
I did almost one year on fruit.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the most extreme
of raw food diets.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And that really started me
on this whole raw thing,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and, you know,
becoming super healthy.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Now it's been 29 years since
I became a vegan, vegetarian.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
In those 29 years I have
barely had any dairy products.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've had fish a
couple of times in those 29

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I never touch meat.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The fruitarian diet, for
me, is the perfect diet.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I never leave that.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Though I don't always
have the willpower

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:90%
to stay on the fruitarian 100%.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
I get a little bored
once in a while.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:90%
You know, and also organic--

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:90%
you know, I don't just do fruit.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.550 align:middle line:84%
When I do fruit I do organic
food if it's available.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And they say that every
seven years your body

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
totally change from down to
all your cells and tissues.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything changes
every seven years.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So actually if you become
raw today or a fruitarian

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.230 align:middle line:84%
or a vegan or whatever
is your goal to be,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in seven years-- which
is so great about this.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's not like--

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:84%
you don't age like
normal or average people,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:90%
because you can actually--

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you can start becoming
like super healthy today

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.370 align:middle line:84%
like a raw vegan diet like
I believe in the most--

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:90%
organic if you can get it.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And in seven years from now, you
can become a healthier person.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we understand
flexibility is the contrary

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:90%
point to aging.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.030 align:middle line:84%
With aging there's a
tendency to contract.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And with youthing there's
a tendancy to expand.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So what we see is
flexibility increases,

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.396 align:middle line:84%
and that's a sign of really
the anti-aging process.

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:90%
It's my own life.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.840 align:middle line:84%
This physical body is
chronologically 65-years-old.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
When I was 60, I
did 601 push-ups.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
When I was a captain of
an undefeated football

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
team at Amherst College,
middle linebacker, guard,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I could do 70 push-ups.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Here I am, 40 years later,
being able to do literally nine

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to 10 times more
push-ups than I could

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:90%
do when I was a 20-year-old.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:90%
What does that tell us?

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It actually tells us
that we are setting off

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:90%
an anti-aging thing.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just physical.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not just endurance.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It is a sense of
youthfulness, a sense of joy,

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:90%
a sense of happiness.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Life greatly improves.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we've set up and
activated the anti-aging genes.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We have activated
the youthing genes.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:90%

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm 83-years-old.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have a doctor's degree
in physical education.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.488 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in
raw foods, and I've

00:07:01.488 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
been taking them for some time.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Well I'm the oldest
one diving now.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
The other divers, the older
divers, as they grew older,

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
they racked up all
kinds of problems.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And a good many
of the divers have

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
had knee replacements, hip
replacements, back surgery,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:90%
heart surgery.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:90%
I've had none of those.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But they say, well,
we have knee problems.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
for yourself, Tom?

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:90%
And I tell him about--

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
take Norwegian cod liver
oil, eat raw foods.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:90%
So this is what we're doing.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I'm
still in one piece.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
metal in my body.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And anybody can start
at any age, at any time.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
If you get nutrition that
they need for their bodies,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%
it's healthier, you're
stronger, you can do more.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And according to my bio-activity
charts that I looked at,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.842 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to live
to be 109, but I

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:90%
don't think that will happen.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to try anyway.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.000 align:middle line:90%
