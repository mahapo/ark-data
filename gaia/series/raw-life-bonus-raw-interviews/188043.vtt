00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.905 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard something
disturbing--

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that the average American
recognizes over 1,000 logos

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and the plants they're
associated with,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:84%
and yet less than five plants
and five birds in their area.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:90%
My name's Brigitte Mars.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm an herbalist.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And I've been a raw foodist
for over seven years.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago,
I lived in a tipi

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and ate nothing but wild, edible
plants for 2 and 1/2 years.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Not once did I go to a store.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks
that all our food

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:84%
needs to come from
the grocery stores.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And grocery stores are great.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Organic, natural food
stores are even better.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Gardens are wonderful.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:90%
I love farmer's markets.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.060 align:middle line:84%
But really, nature abounds with
a living cornucopia of plants

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
that we can use.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Plants like acorns, which are
the fruit or the nut of the oak

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:84%
tree, yield a high-protein, high
in vitamin B complex starch.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
However, you have to wait
till the acorns are ripe.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you leach them
to get the tannins out.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's simply done by
soaking the acorns in water.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you can grind the
acorns up and make a porridge

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:90%
out of them.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can make
them into a flour

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
to use to increase the
nutritional content of whatever

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:90%
you're making.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the wild
plants are the ancestors

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:84%
of our
culinary-celebrated plants

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
that we consume on
a regular basis.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And one of those is the thistle.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Thistles are a member of the
daisy or Asteraceae family.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is the ancestor
of an artichoke.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you were hungry.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
You could take the
young thistle stalk,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
peel it with a carrot peeler.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you could
eat the inner stalk.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I like to marinate it in a bit
of olive oil and lemon juice.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You could also dig up the root,
really, at any time of the year

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and eat them raw.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I prefer eating it raw.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.780 align:middle line:90%
But some people cook it.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The thistle flowers
are also edible.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:90%
And you can also eat the seeds.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.222 align:middle line:84%
Now, you hear a lot
about milk thistle seed

00:02:04.222 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:84%
being a great remedy
for the liver.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But really, all thistle
seeds are edible.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And they actually help to
stimulate protein synthesis

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:90%
in the liver.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of birds know
that thistle seeds

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
are great nourishing food
as well as a healing tonic.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I live in Colorado.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And on the list of noxious weeds
is the St. John's-wort However,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
people do go to the health
food stores and buy St.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
John's-wort because it has been
found to be a remedy for mild

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:90%
to moderate depression.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.020 align:middle line:84%
You can also eat the
flowers of St. John's-wort.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
This herb helps the
light to shine through

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and it helps to
improve people's moods.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Also, it's a
wonderful liver herb.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorites
is dandelion--

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Taraxacum officinale.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Dandelion-- every
part of it is edible.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.660 align:middle line:90%
You can eat the leaves.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:90%
They're best in the springtime.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
You can eat the flowers.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
high in lutein,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
which is a remedy for
helping to improve our vision

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and to help prevent
night blindness.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And the dandelion root could be
dug up at any time of the year.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And I like to just chop it up
and add some nama shoyu tamari

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:90%
in a little olive oil.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the food dehydrator
for a couple of hours

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a
wonderful, delicious dish

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:90%
that is so good for your liver.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I see dandelions as being
one of our archetypal herbs

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to help people better deal
with environmental pollutants.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
After all, the dandelion
itself is a survivor.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And by imbibing the properties
that the plant takes on,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it can help give us
the same benefits.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:90%
So we have here fireweed--

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Epilobium angustifolium.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
first things to bloom

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.360 align:middle line:90%
after there's been a fire.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And you see a lot of this
in the Pacific Northwest.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
honeys is fireweed honey.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But I've also eaten
fireweed as a vegetable.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
You collect the young shoots
and the buds in the springtime.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And you could add
them to a salad.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:90%
You can marinate them.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So we've got edible
flowers, edible nuts, roots.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere you look.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And rather than thinking
that our food always

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
has to be purchased,
I encourage you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
to start cultivating a garden
where maybe you grow vegetables

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
and you also learn the names
of some of your common plants

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.449 align:middle line:90%
that offer themselves freely.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:90%
