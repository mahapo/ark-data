00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Raw food nutrition is one of
the greatest things out there

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:84%
because it's not only healing
you in terms of the diabetic

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, and the ill health,
and all those problems,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:90%
but it's spiritual.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It's connected to the earth.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that one of
the things that disconnects us

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
from the earth is because we
take a natural food like this,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:84%
we throw it through microwaves,
roast it, broil it, extract it,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
add chemicals to
it, put it in bags,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.783 align:middle line:84%
and then sell it to people,
and people eat that.

00:00:38.783 --> 00:00:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just
eat it straight

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:90%
from the earth directly?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.093 align:middle line:84%
That's the underlying
teaching here.

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you do that-- and
I've been doing that for over

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:90%
a decade--

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%
you do get connected to
God, to Mother Earth,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
or whatever in a
different way than you

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
can perceive with your mind.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of value that you
cannot get anywhere else or you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:90%
can't imagine it.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:90%
You have to experience it.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.315 align:middle line:84%
Your spirituality is
awakened in a different way

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:90%
in a different sense.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.315 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
that come to spirituality

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:90%
eating a lot of bad foods too.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But once you get
on that bandwagon

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.240 align:middle line:90%
of putting God's food in you--

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
there's a reason that every
major religion has a fasting

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
time and a cleansing
time, so that we

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:84%
can make that connection again,
so that we can get closer.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to put God's
foods into your body, of course

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that God flow that's
going through you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:90%
is tapped into a lot easier.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And I know my own
spiritual practice went up

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.557 align:middle line:84%
millions of degrees
once my diet changed

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:90%
and I cleaned my body out.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.307 align:middle line:84%
It made all the
difference in the world.

00:01:40.307 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> As your physical body becomes
less gross and less blocked

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
with toxins, you automatically
become a living vortex to be

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
able to pull down
the divine energy.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It puts you in touch with
mankind in a different way.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Your love, your
heart is awakened

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
in a different way when
you're only putting God's food

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
in and not the death
and destruction

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
of the other animals that
we share the planet with.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
When you get out of that
realm of death and destruction

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and eating raw,
living foods, I think

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:84%
it raises the vibrations
of not only you,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.640 align:middle line:90%
but everything around you.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything is vibration
and everything is frequency.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
The food we eat, the thoughts
we think, our intentions,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:90%
our desires, it's all vibration.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So beginning with
food, I remember

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.155 align:middle line:84%
when I first became
a vegetarian,

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
it didn't have a lot
to do with health.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.238 align:middle line:84%
I had to do with
that I didn't want

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:90%
a certain vibration in my body.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get the
vibration of a dead cow

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:84%
or I didn't want the vibration
of a fearful chicken entering

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.690 align:middle line:90%
into my body.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I wanted my body to be able to
maintain a certain vibration

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and frequency that
would match my prayer

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.455 align:middle line:90%
life and my meditation life.

00:02:53.455 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And our body shall
be full of light.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:90%
It's all interrelated.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So the kind of food we eat and
the vibration that it carries,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:84%
how it was taken care
of, the hormones,

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and the chemicals that are
pumped into it, the ranch--

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:90%
it's soil--

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that it's grown in, all of
that is frequency of vibration

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:84%
that can, of course,
invade the body temple,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.770 align:middle line:90%
the cells of your body temple.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:90%
They won't replicate properly.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
All of that allows for other
kind of toxic chemicals

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to move through your body,
which will, of course,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.500 align:middle line:84%
affect your mood,
affect your perception.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Your perception determines
your experience in life.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So all of that's interrelated,
you see, from the kind of food

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
you eat, the kind of thought
you think, the kind of actions

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:90%
you ultimately take.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Coming from a low
frequency-- a low vibration--

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
you end up creating
a world for yourself

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
that's not about happiness, or
joy, or bliss, or creativity.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of become
part of the crowd

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of the walking dead, those
who are sleepwalking in life.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest challenge of
today for human beings is there

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
is a negative gravitational pull
to go in the other direction.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is insane is
considered sane in my world.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
So it's not very easy to step
outside of what's considered

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:90%
"conventional" and "normal."

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult
to step outside this.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So if someone starts
to make a change

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
in their diet or
their lifestyle,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.233 align:middle line:90%
they receive a lot of ridicule.

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what are you
doing, or, that's different,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
or, ew, what is
that you're eating?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:90%
And you become uncomfortable.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.150 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to slide into
and be comfortable with what

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:90%
everyone else is doing.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that once
you step on the path,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it isn't all negative because
the body is meant to thrive.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not only meant to
survive, but to thrive.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:90%
We have this inner intuition.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a book.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:90%
It's called intuition.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:90%
We know what's right.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It's tapping into it.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> In the journey to
become a champion,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:84%
there is going to be
the urge to give up.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
There is going to be
the desire to quit,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and that is a natural
human response. ,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to be the
best in order to change,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to step
ahead of the crowd,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
in order to get into something
new, it takes courage.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
there's going to be

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
another energy there,
which is, let's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.596 align:middle line:90%
get back in the comfort zone.

00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Even people who have a
strong spiritual practice,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
it is wise to monitor what
goes inside of your mouth

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
because you end up using your
spiritual practice to overcome

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
the toxic energy that you
place in your body temple.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you went all pistons
firing, then what you eat,

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
what you drink, what you think,
your intention, all of that

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.706 align:middle line:90%
is extremely important.

00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The opportunity for people
that are struggling in life,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
that are having health issues,
I want to encourage people

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to realize there are too many
health issues that you really

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:90%
can't overcome.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And your body has that God-given
built in remedial capability.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is understand that we

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:84%
have to live according
to natural law.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
By living according to
natural law, what you give up

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is going to free your body
up to do what it was meant

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:90%
to do from the very beginning.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.075 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I learned
from the Indian style,

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
the fruitarian way of
life, and also exercises,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and mental work, and spiritual
work on a daily basis--

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
basically, start when you
get up in the morning first,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be your own
kind of policeman with your own

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:90%
thought process.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we are bombarded
by negativity and anxiety

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.343 align:middle line:84%
People are dying, and there's
accidents, and there's wars,

00:06:40.343 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and there's rapes, and
there's horrible things going

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:90%
on all the time.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So you always have to make,
sure as much as you can,

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to stay in a positive
frame of mind.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.535 align:middle line:84%
The glass is always half
full no matter what happens.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And you have to pray.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.700 align:middle line:84%
You have to have faith in
God and faith in yourself

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:90%
and find your purpose in life.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It happened for me
when I turned 50.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I was going
to be a public speaker.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's just interesting,
when you make a decision

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and you make a commitment, how
things flow into your life.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Something inside has to light
up, some level of inspiration,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:90%
in order to keep people going.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
that inspiration

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is knowing that what
awaits on the other side

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.665 align:middle line:84%
is something better than they
could have ever even known.

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a long, long,
long, difficult road,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
but I do think that we are
making inroads into it.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:90%
There is an awareness.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:90%
There are people waking up.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:90%
It's about waking up.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
People are walking around
asleep on our planet.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:90%
They're not paying attention.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You hear little
buzz words of what's

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.807 align:middle line:84%
going on with the
environment, but what are we

00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
doing in our lives,
specifically,

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:90%
to make those changes?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
We aren't working with
the full picture enough,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.266 align:middle line:84%
but I think the seeds
are being planted.

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And mainstream people
really need to get with this

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
because many of them are like
sheep, walking to slaughter,

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:90%
They're just in a haze.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They think they've arrived on
the planet to be consumers.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
They're addicted to the next
mall, the next fast food

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:84%
restaurant, the next
bigger and brighter

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.072 align:middle line:90%
hamburger or something.

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're killing themselves
and setting themselves

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
up to be leeched on by the
pharmaceutical companies

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:90%
until they die.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's not why we're here.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
We're here to be creative
expressions of the infinite.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:84%
We are the stars looking back at
themselves with all the power,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's within us, being used
to conform to a sick society.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to set
ourselves free to heal,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
to allow the power to express
so that we could not only

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
be the creative individuals
that we're called to be,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
but to then build a world in
which every boy and girl, man

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and woman has their
basic needs met

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
so we can harvest
everyone's gifts

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and talents and absolutely
build Heaven on Earth.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:90%
