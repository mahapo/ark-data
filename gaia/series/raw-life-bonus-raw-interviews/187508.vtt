00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, a raw food diet
is perfect for the best health

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.830 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Even top-notch athletes
are choosing it.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be at
your very best, listen up.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I first got into nutrition
when I realized that that was

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be what made me
successful as an athlete

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
or didn't.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I first got into triathlon
when I was around 15.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that,
to be successful,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of course I'd have to
train a huge amount.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I looked
at some of the top athlete's

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.935 align:middle line:84%
training programs, and I looked
at just average athlete's

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:90%
training programs.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
What really surprised
me is that there

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
is very little difference
between the top in the world

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:90%
and just the average.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
So of course my
question to myself

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
was, what separates
number one from those

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.880 align:middle line:84%
who are just kind of
mid-pack, if the training

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:90%
program's the same?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
What I realized was that it
has to do with what happens in

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:90%
between training.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with recovery.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And a huge part of recovery
has to do with nutrition.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And I tried a whole
bunch of different types

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:90%
of eating plans.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I tried the high carb, low
carb, high protein, low protein,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:90%
all these different things.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And some were
better than others.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
But usually they weren't good.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing I found
that was really good.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Then I tried a completely
plant-based diet.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So no animal products at all,
no dairy, no eggs, no honey.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And at first it
didn't work well.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I was hungry.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:90%
I didn't recover well.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I was lethargic.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.525 align:middle line:90%
And recovery was really bad.

00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big problem
because I couldn't train much.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So I found that if I wanted
to eat a plant-based diet

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
learn more about it.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And I found the
things I was lacking

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
was vitamin B12, iron,
calcium, omega-3 fatty acids,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.803 align:middle line:90%
complete protein.

00:01:53.803 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I found plant-based sources
for all these different foods,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
blended them together, and
had a blender drink every day.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.122 align:middle line:84%
And eventually that is what
evolved into what is now Vega.

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's how it started
back, when I first

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:90%
made it for myself.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And it worked really well.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.950 align:middle line:90%
My recovery was so much better.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I was able to actually train
more than other people.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Therefore I improved
quicker, and was

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
able to start my professional
career much earlier than I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
would have, had I not
pay close attention

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.733 align:middle line:90%
to detail on recovery.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the only thing

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.435 align:middle line:84%
that separated me
from other athletes

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:90%
who I improved faster than.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.435 align:middle line:90%
It's not more talent.

00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything other than
a different nutrition program.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The reason my recovery was
faster than other people's,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
faster than my
competition was because I

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:90%
was eating lots of raw food.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with raw food is
that it digests so much more

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:90%
easily.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
It's got digestive enzymes.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore I didn't have to
expend the energy to digest it.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.098 align:middle line:84%
When you eat food,
doesn't matter what kind,

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:90%
your body has to break it down.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't have
enzymes, your body

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
has to build enzymes,
which is fine.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
A healthy body can do
that, but it takes work.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you're spending
energy building enzymes

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and digesting and assimilating
food, the net gain of that food

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:90%
is so much smaller.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.788 align:middle line:84%
So the total amount you get
from it is just not there.

00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Even though you've taken a
lot of calories, what you're

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:90%
left with is pretty minimal.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> With nutrition
you gain energy,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
so you find out how you can
dive better or perform better.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in
raw foods, and I've

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
been taking them for some time.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:84%
I've started with
vitamins and minerals,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and raw foods is
where it comes from.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So I got into raw foods,
as much as I could.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I, when
we got married,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
we got started
with carrot juice.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
We started drinking
carrot juice.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:84%
From there we found out that
we could take raw vegetables

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
and mix them all together,
as well as carrot juice

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and with the carrot juice.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:90%
And we drank that.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.150 align:middle line:90%
It was regular for us.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:90%
And we gave it to our kids.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And our kids have
all grown up healthy.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
I've found that many of the
divers, as they grew older,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.203 align:middle line:84%
they racked up all
kinds of problems.

00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And a good many
of the divers have

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
had knee replacements, hip
replacements, back surgery,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:90%
heart surgery.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I've had none of those.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And with good nutrition,
you not only live longer,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.358 align:middle line:84%
but you perform better with
the nutrition that you take.

00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Victor Candal and
I've been eating raw for four

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.666 align:middle line:90%
I do mixed martial arts.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's been an
incredible change for me--

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
my health, physically,
mentally, and spiritually.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.450 align:middle line:84%
What I am getting from the
raw food is my stamina.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It led to stamina that
is absolutely excellent.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it's 70% better
from the time from eating raw.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
The raw has been
absolutely awesome

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
in many different areas,
like, I injure less.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of Brazilian Jujitsu
a lot of mixed martial arts.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And I train, you know, four,
five, even six times a week,

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
running on the beach, bicycle,
and a lot of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can see that with
people for half my age--

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle line:84%
I'm 44-- people who
have been training here

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:90%
who are 20, 21-years-old.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And they injure
more often than me.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Actually I almost
have no injuries,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and I'm training more
than they are training.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm 53-years-old.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.907 align:middle line:84%
And when I was obviously a
teenager in my early 20s,

00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I was on the United States
World Team in figure skating.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I was second in
the United States

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
in pair skating
with my sister Gail.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was third in the
world professional pairs

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:90%
championship in 1976.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to get
back in skating again

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:90%
in time for the Olympics.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I was a very avid ice
skater in most of my youth.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And even after that
time, I trained athletes.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of work with
athletes in my practice.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is that
a lot of these world-class

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
athletes I work with--

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
we realize that it's
not going to affect

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
their performance greatly
by being on a worse

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:90%
state or a better diet.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But what it really
does affect is

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:84%
whether they get sick or
not coming through the--

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
unless they can train
consecutively, for like six

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
months straight,
they're not going

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to reach their maximum
performance level.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.685 align:middle line:84%
And then if they're
a world class skier,

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
let's say, they're going
to miss their event.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
If they get sick with a flu
or a cold a couple of weeks

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.252 align:middle line:84%
before they're two
big events, they're

00:06:24.252 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
not going to be the
top five in the world

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.918 align:middle line:90%
or top 10 in the world.

00:06:26.918 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to
lose their opportunity.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
When you're a top
athlete, a top tennis

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.995 align:middle line:84%
player or a top
basketball player

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:33.537 align:middle line:84%
or a top baseball
player, when you're

00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
a top athlete, top soccer
player, whatever you are,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
you can't be in
bed sick and expect

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.988 align:middle line:90%
to beat the top of your form.

00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And these athletes who
shake people's hands

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.238 align:middle line:84%
and travel all over
the place, they

00:06:43.238 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:90%
say, well, can I help them--

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.060 align:middle line:84%
because they know
from their past--

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
go through the season and not
get sick, and not catch a cold

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
and not get a flu?

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:90%
And I says, yeah.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.882 align:middle line:90%
We've got to get you nutrients.

00:06:52.882 --> 00:06:53.703 align:middle line:90%
And then it works.

00:06:53.703 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And these athletes
have said to me, wow,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
you might have saved
me $500,000 this year.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Because my success
on the tour was

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:84%
because I got to every
single event in great shape.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.283 align:middle line:90%
I didn't lose any time in bed.

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't lose any time off the
schedule and miss an event.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.867 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that when
I was a world-class figure

00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:84%
skater, the advantage
we had, I think,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.540 align:middle line:84%
was that we were
able to continue

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
a high level of training
and not be interrupted

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.370 align:middle line:84%
by so many of the illnesses
that other people had.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> As a former
college-level athlete,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I found 40 years later, or
45 years later at this point,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 65, that
there is more strength--

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
when I mean more strength,
I could do 70 push-ups

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.630 align:middle line:84%
as captain of an undefeated
college football team,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and National Football Hall
of Fame football player,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and now at the age of
60, I could do 601.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And the endurance
has increased way

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:90%
beyond what I had in my 20s.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The flexibility-- I could
barely get my hands to my knees

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
when I was 20, and now I can
put my hands on the floor.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
