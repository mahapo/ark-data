00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We have the most overweight
population ever in the history

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.260 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's still growing fatter.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Food addictions, refined
sugar, saturated fat,

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.102 align:middle line:90%
fast foods, childhood obesity--

00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
our society is in the
midst of a serious health

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:90%
crisis that is out of control.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
People are dieting
in record numbers.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is growing worse.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
If raw foods can
reverse diabetes,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
can they also work
for weight loss?

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.833 align:middle line:84%
>> What we call addiction is
someone who has certain needs

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't found a
better way to fulfill them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.583 align:middle line:84%
So I believe there are six human
needs-- a need for certainty,

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:90%
which is comfort.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And food is an easy way to
do that-- so it's cigarettes,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.862 align:middle line:84%
so it's alcohol, so it's
drugs for some people.

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:90%
And it meets that need.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, you get certainty by
trying to control everybody.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.628 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do it by
eating a certain food

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:90%
or taking a certain drug.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Or you get certainty
by your faith.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.775 align:middle line:84%
Or you get certainty by
accomplishing things.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:00.025 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of ways to do it.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Some are destructive.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Some are more proactive
or empowering.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:90%
We need uncertainty.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:90%
We need variety.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, people
think eating raw foods,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and they go, well, there's
only so much I can eat.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at
what most people eat,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:90%
it's pretty habitual.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
But we want that change
in flavors in our mouth

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and that change of state that
comes that food can provide.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
We have a need to feel
significant, unique, important.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So some people are
cheese connoisseurs

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:90%
or a certain form of alcohol--

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, they know
everything about every wine.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.425 align:middle line:84%
So we're meeting an emotional
need, not just a physical one.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
We have a need for
connection and love.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we feel
alone and separate,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
going out and smoking
that cigarette

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or going out and
eating that food

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is like a way to connect and
give yourself a little reward.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And then we all need to grow.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.053 align:middle line:90%
We all need to contribute.

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But those needs are usually
the last looked at by people.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.857 align:middle line:84%
So being able to find a
better way to meet those needs

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:90%
is the way to do it.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.982 align:middle line:90%
You never get rid of something.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
You always replace it.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
If you try to just stop doing
something, it won't last.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
As I say, discipline never
lasts-- fulfillment does.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.562 align:middle line:84%
So if you can find another way
to be fulfilled-- like now you

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
have more energy from this or
now you feel free of something,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
or now you have a pride that
you took control of your life

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.676 align:middle line:84%
and you took yourself
to another level,

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:84%
those things can now
move you in a direction

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:90%
that has a lasting impact.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Americans eat a diet where
51% of calories come from

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.430 align:middle line:84%
processed foods with no
micronutrients in them,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
no phytochemicals,
no antioxidants.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.145 align:middle line:84%
Another 40% of the American
diet is animal products

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
which still don't
contain vitamin

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
E, and C, and K, in folate,
and bioflavonoids, and lignans.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And they don't contain those
antioxidants and phytochemicals

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that we know are necessary
for human nutrition.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying here is
that a bagel is just

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:90%
like a piece of chicken.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't contain
the phytochemicals

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and the antioxidants
humans are starving for.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So food supplies with
macronutrients-- macronutrients

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.118 align:middle line:84%
are those calorie-containing
nutrients-- fat, carbohydrate,

00:02:47.118 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:90%
and protein.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And Americans eat too
many macronutrients.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And they make us fat.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And an increase or an
excess of any macronutrient

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.065 align:middle line:90%
is dangerous to our health.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:57.815 align:middle line:84%
Too much fat-- Americans
eat too much fat.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:58.970 align:middle line:90%
We have to eat less fat.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Americans eat too
much carbohydrate.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to eat
less carbohydrate.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Americans eat too much protein.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.487 align:middle line:90%
We have to eat less protein.

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
We have to eat less of
all three macronutrients.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But we have to eat more
micronutrients in the process.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
When your diet is deficient
in micronutrients,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.503 align:middle line:84%
it makes you want to eat
more macaroni and cheese.

00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when you're
not meeting your micronutrient

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:90%
needs, you have to overeat.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And it creates food addictions.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And you actually feel ill
if you're not constantly

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.903 align:middle line:84%
putting food in your
mouth every hour or two.

00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't meet
your micronutrient needs,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to overeat and
you have to be overweight.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, whenever
someone's got to eat,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
I always say to them, you
know, if you're going to have

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:84%
concentrated food-- whether
it's a protein or whether

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that's a carbohydrate--
have a big salad.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Have some vegetables.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Have something that's
alive, ideally,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
as the start of that process.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Because it starts
to fill you up.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.800 align:middle line:90%
And you start not feeling so--

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
you get satiated on good
things instead of satiated

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.577 align:middle line:90%
on bad things.

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Food is a very
addictive substance.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind that
the addictiveness just

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.053 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the buildup
of toxicity of your tissues,

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
that if cells don't meet
their nutrient needs,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:90%
they build up toxins.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
If you take in calories without
sufficient micronutrients,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:90%
toxins build up in the cells.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
We utilize these nutrients
to process calories.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
If we stop eating
for a few hours--

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.702 align:middle line:84%
when you're not digesting
food is the time

00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
when the body can most
effectively repair

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and detoxify, and remove the
extra things, the excesses it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't need.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:90%
So that's when we feel ill--

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:90%
when digestion stops.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Because feeling
ill is mobilizing

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these toxic
waste products' removal.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
People don't like feeling ill.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.728 align:middle line:84%
The word addiction
means that if you

00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:30.520 align:middle line:84%
try to stop doing
something that's harmful,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:90%
you get discomfort.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Humans don't want to
feel uncomfortable.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.605 align:middle line:84%
So they have a tendency
to want to keep

00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
doing the same habits
that caused the problem

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We all know those comfort
foods we go for under stress.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And most people are under
stress because their idea

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:84%
of how life's
supposed to be doesn't

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:90%
match their current life.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And when that stress happens,
we've got three choices--

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
blame something, blame our
environment, blame some person,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%
blame ourselves.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Blame doesn't change anything.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.685 align:middle line:84%
Or you've got to make a
change in that environment.

00:04:57.685 --> 00:04:59.268 align:middle line:84%
You got to change
your life conditions

00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:90%
or change your mindset.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:90%
That's not an easy thing to do.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.245 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to do
when you've got people

00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:90%
around you that support you.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.945 align:middle line:84%
But people, every day, go out
and their friends or family

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
make fun of them and go, you
know, that's so and so's food.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, people still

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
see the difference in them and
then they start to get hooked.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> One very impressive weight
reduction story is that

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of Angela Stokes.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It was the living testimony of
the power of a raw vegan diet.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And she is so happy
that she made a change

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.240 align:middle line:90%
to eating raw food.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if you really want
to make a positive change

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
in your lifestyle for the
better, you can do it.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, my story of raw
foods is that I lost about 160

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:90%
pounds from eating this way.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I used to weigh
nearly 300 pounds.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:90%
I was morbidly obese.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I was in the category
of people who

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
were more or less
killing themselves

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:90%
from the way they're eating.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.930 align:middle line:84%
This was taken maybe five or six
years ago, something like that.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
This was at the point when
I was nearly 300 pounds.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:90%
And this is an after photo.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:90%
This is also the after.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I can remember walking down
the street and going from

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
McDonald's into Burger King
into McDonald's-- you know,

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
just constant, thousands upon
thousands of calories a day,

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and primarily processed
starches and refined sugars.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So this was May 2002 when my
whole life completely changed.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Iceland.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And my best friend
was my homeopath.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And she could see how
close I was, that I was not

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
interested in discussing
anything to do

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:90%
with health with anybody else.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But she could also see that I
was very ill and I needed help.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So she saw that it needed
an indirect approach.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me
one day, would you

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:90%
like to borrow a book?

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, sure, OK.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me
a stack of books.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of them,
hidden in there,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:84%
was the "Raw Family"
by the Boutenkos.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Buotenkos
are a Russian family

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
who live here in the States.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:90%
And they are amazing.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
They're a whole family that
went raw and cured themselves

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds of conditions.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
juvenile diabetes, arrhythmia,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.567 align:middle line:84%
obesity, asthma--
all kinds of things.

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And they completely
transformed their lives.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And this book is their testimony
of what happened for them.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So I started to read this
book and I couldn't stop.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.070 align:middle line:84%
For some reason on that
night in that moment,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
this book just spoke to me.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was like my message.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that from that
point, there was no going back.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I read the whole book in one go.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt like
this is my answer.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:84%
I had never had any interest
in diets, or slimming pills,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And then I read this book.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was like--

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing to question.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, why would
I not do this?

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing for
me to lose in doing

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:90%
this except all this weight.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I had huge brambles in
my head, that night, I

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
can tell you-- like, trying to
convince the part in me that

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
was completely addicted to junk
food that this was a good idea.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't an
easy battle to win.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:90%
But the next day, I did it.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I went 100% raw vegan overnight
after reading that book from

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:84%
being the person who
literally could not walk past

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:90%
the McDonald's.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:90%
That's who I used to be.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:90%
And then I went 100% raw vegan.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pretty crazy
thing to do when you're

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of position.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.713 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that
I recommend for other people

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:84%
to do if you're coming from that
kind of background that I was.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Because the detox is phenomenal.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And everyone's like-- I'm crazy.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
My jaw was just in chronic
pain from chewing so much.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.478 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd always been eating
all of these sloppy food

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:90%
that required no chewing.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there I
was grazing on nuts.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:90%
But it worked.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:90%
That was the important thing.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
I started to see the changes
and so did everybody else

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if you could
see the weight burning off me

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.585 align:middle line:90%
It was phenomenal.

00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to weight
loss, I just want to say that

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people are so
involved with keeping skinny,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and keeping their weight down,
and going on a million diets--

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:90%
forget about diets.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
If you do this, the raw vegan
diet, organic vegan diet,

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
you will never have
to worry about weight.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Because before, when I was
into cooked food and meats,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything else, I
was always on a diet--

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.290 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, I go to eat food, I've
got to make sure everyday

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I get enough
avocados, and bananas,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.297 align:middle line:84%
and walnuts so I can
keep the weight on.

00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get too
gaunt and too skinny

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:84%
because then people
think I'm not healthy.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's so easy to get thin.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.210 align:middle line:90%
You eat the raw foods.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And you watch your salt intake.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.683 align:middle line:84%
And you think a lot of
people who go into raw vegan

00:10:13.683 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and go to a lot of
restaurants-- there's

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
a lot of high-salt foods.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:90%
But control that.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Just basically make
your own juices.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Eat your raw nuts and your
raw fruits and salads,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're on a very great
diet that will give you

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
everything you need for your
beauty, for your health,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and longevity.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> By its very nature,
living food diet--

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
raw food diet-- at least
80% will naturally bring you

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:90%
to your optimal weight.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.805 align:middle line:84%
I'm the same weight as when
I graduated high school--

00:10:45.805 --> 00:10:47.260 align:middle line:90%
a pretty optimal weight.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And it has not varied.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:90%
I've been alive since 1983.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're way overweight,
you will lose weight down

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.920 align:middle line:90%
to your natural weight.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And the average we see is
about 100 pounds a year.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember-- we're not
talking about deprivation.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.340 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a pleasurable diet,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:90%
a good-tasting diet.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.990 align:middle line:90%
So it is not about deprivation.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It is just the
natural way to live

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that naturally brings
you to the idea of,

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:90%
why do you lose weight?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you can eat half as
much and get all the nutrition

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.670 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We see obese people become
thin and thin people become

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:90%
strong.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And why this is is when
you nourish the human body,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:84%
it has an inherent sense to
regulate and balance itself.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
When people are thin
to begin with because

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.030 align:middle line:90%
they highly metabolize food--

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
they may be athletes,
they may be under a lot

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:90%
of pressure or stress--

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
we certainly greatly encourage
weightlifting exercises

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, when
people are losing weight,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
it's not aerobics
that burn fat most,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
it is weightlifting
that burns fat most.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say that both
groups shouldn't weight lift

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and both groups shouldn't
do aerobic exercise

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
because that is a big
part of being healthy.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not all food.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, when people
say we are what we eat,

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I would say we are
what we metabolize.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
We're either going
to break this down

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
be able to use it

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.835 align:middle line:90%
or we have to eliminate it.

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.918 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not using
and you're eliminating it,

00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
it's wasted energy.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has some
things you're going

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
to consume that obviously have
to go through that process.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But more alive foods give
you a greater concentration

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.103 align:middle line:84%
of what your body can use
with a lot less energy

00:12:30.103 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:90%
to be able to break it down.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And that difference--
it's physical.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.
