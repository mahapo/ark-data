00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Recent research in Brazil
has revealed the discovery

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
of an ancient megalithic
observatory built at least five

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
centuries before the European
conquest of the Americas began.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
This finding, along with
other archeological,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:84%
fascinating discoveries
in Brazil in recent years,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
which include giant
land carvings, remains

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
of fortified settlements,
and complex road networks,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
are challenging
the earlier views

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
that the Amazon
had been untouched

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:84%
by humans, except for
small nomadic tribes.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Nearly all the discoveries
were made after a period

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of widespread deforestation
in the Amazon in the early

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%
'90s through to the mid-2000s.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
The archeology of the Amazon.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
For decades, the Amazon was
thought by archeologists to have

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
been almost uninhabited
rainforest but recently were

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.130 align:middle line:84%
made after a period of
widespread deforestation

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
in the Amazon in the early
'90s through to the mid-2000s.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:90%
The archeology of the Amazon.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
For decades, the Amazon was
thought by archeologists

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to have been almost
uninhabited rainforest.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But recently, researchers
have been finding new evidence

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that the area was, in fact, a
hive of human activity and home

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.970 align:middle line:90%
to millions of people.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:10%
In March 2018, a study
funded by National Geographic

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:10%
and the European Research
Council Project Past

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:10%
revealed details of 81 sites
in the previously unexplored

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:10%
territory of the Amazon's
upper Tapajós Basin.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Settlements
discovered in the area

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
ranged from small villages
of around 100 feet

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
wide to a large site
covering 19 hectares

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
The sites were first discovered
by satellite imagery of the area

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
revealed by deforestation.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The remains of the
settlements are represented

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
by ditches enclosing the
sites for fortification,

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:84%
sunken roads, and earth
platforms on which houses

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:90%
would once have stood.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jonas Gregoria de Souza
from the University of Exeter

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
was the first
author of the study.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
He said regarding the
findings and the distribution

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
of the sites, "The idea
that the Amazon was

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
a pristine forest,
untouched by humans,

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
home to scattered
nomadic populations,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
we already know
that was not true.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
The big debate is how
populations were distributed

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
in pre-Columbian
times in the Amazon."

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
The idea was that
in the areas that

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
are located further away
from the main rivers,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
populations maybe
were actually smaller.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And they had a negligible
impact on the environment.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We demonstrated
that these regions

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
may have had pretty
large populations as well

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
as in the past.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Wood charcoal associated with
pottery fragments from one site

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
was carbon dated to
between 1410 and 1460

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.430 align:middle line:84%
AD, which fits in well
with the dating of many

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
of the sites
previously discovered

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
in the southern
rim of the Amazon,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
which showed a peak of
activity between 1250 and 1500.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:10%
Models based on the team's
research indicate that

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.280 align:middle line:10%
at the time, the southern rim of
the Amazon alone could have had

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:10%
a population of between
500,000 and 1 million people.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:10%
However, this
population was soon

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:10%
to be decimated by the
arrival of Europeans.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
According to de Souza,
diseases traveled much faster

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:90%
than people.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And probably this
population was already

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
weakened by diseases
brought by Europeans

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
even before the Europeans
set foot in the area.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:90%
The Brazilian Stonehenge.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:10%
The Solstice
Archeological Park is

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:10%
located near the
city of Calçoene

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:10%
in Amapá State, northern Brazil.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
The site contains a
megalithic stone circle

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and is often referred to
as the Amazon Stonehenge,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.030 align:middle line:90%
or the Brazilian Stonehenge.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
The megalithic site,
which is located

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
on a hilltop on the bank
of the Rio Grande River,

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
consists of 127 upright
blocks of granite,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
each of up to 13
feet in diameter

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
and weighing several
tons, standing

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
evenly paced in a circle,
measuring over 98 feet

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:90%
in diameter.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.250 align:middle line:84%
After conducting radiocarbon
testing and carrying out

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
measurements during the
winter solstice at the site,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
some scholars in the field of
archaeoastronomy determined that

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
an indigenous culture
arranged the megaliths

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
into an astronomical observatory
about 1,000 years ago or five

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:84%
centuries before the European
conquest of the Americas began.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And three and a
half thousand years

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:84%
after the building
of Stonehenge.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists theorize
that the site, referred

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to in academic
sources as APCA18,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
was constructed by a
sophisticated indigenous

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
people for astronomical,
ceremonial, or burial purposes,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.290 align:middle line:84%
or even a combination
of all three.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the stones at the
site has a circular hole

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:90%
carved into it.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
During the winter
solstice, the sun

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:84%
shines directly
through this hole

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.520 align:middle line:84%
onto another rock,
supporting the idea

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that the Amazonian
Stonehenge was

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:90%
used as an astronomical site.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
According to The New
York Times, the site

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
was discovered by a cattle
rancher named Lailson Camilo da

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Silva.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, da Silva was
removing trees in the late 1990s

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to make land for his cattle
to graze on when he discovered

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the stones.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
In reality, da Silva already
knew they were there,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
having initially found
them in the '60s.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But he said he had avoided
the site because he

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:90%
felt that it was sacred.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Recently, hundreds of huge
earthworks known as geoglyphs

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:84%
have been discovered
in Western Brazil,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
revealing the last remnants of
land used by ancient societies

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:84%
before the dense foliage of
the Amazon rainforest concealed

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:90%
them centuries ago.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
The peak period of forest
burning to clear land happened

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
between 2,300 and
1,400 years ago,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:84%
during which the first
earthworks are believed to have

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.700 align:middle line:90%
been constructed.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
While the form and
extent of these sites

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
can be determined using
aerial observations,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
researchers are still not
sure what the original purpose

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
of the sites was.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Many of the structures are
unlikely to have been villages

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
as excavation at
the sites has not

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
revealed the substantial
amounts of cultural artifacts

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
which would be expected if
they had been habitation sites.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
The layout of the
sites also suggests

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
that they weren't built
for defensive purposes.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:84%
One explanation which
has been put forward

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
is that the areas were used for
ritual gatherings of some kind

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and so would have been visited
only intermittently by those

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
who once lived in the area.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Archeologist
Jennifer Watling has

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
compared the layout of the
sites with England's Stonehenge,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
saying, "It's
interesting to note

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that the format of the
geoglyphs with an outer ditch

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and inner wall enclosure
are what are classically

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%
described as henge sites.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
The earliest phases at
Stonehenge consisted

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:84%
of a similarly laid
out enclosure."

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The latest discovery
in the Amazon.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
In November 2020, it was
announced in the press

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that one of the world's
largest collections

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of prehistoric rock art had
been discovered in the Amazonian

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
rainforest.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
The discovery, described as "The
Sistine Chapel of the Ancients,"

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.000 align:middle line:84%
consisted of tens of thousands
of paintings of animals

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and humans created up to 12 and
1/2 thousand years ago on cliff

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
faces stretching across
nearly 8 miles in Colombia.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The date of the artwork was
based partially on images of now

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
extinct ice age animals,
such as the mastodon,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
a prehistoric relative of the
elephant that had been extinct

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
in South America for
at least 12,000 years.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
There are also depictions of
Palaeolama, an extinct camelid,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.890 align:middle line:84%
as well as giant sloths
and iron age horses,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
all seen at first
hand and painted

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
by some of the very first
humans ever to reach the Amazon.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Other images include fish,
turtles, lizards, and birds,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:84%
as well as people dancing and
holding hands with one figure

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
wearing a mask resembling
a bird with a beak.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
The incredible discovery was
filmed for a major Channel 4

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.590 align:middle line:90%
series called "Jungle Mystery--

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Lost Kingdoms of the Amazon."

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
The documentary's presenter,
archeologist, and explorer,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
Ella Al-Shamahi, said of
the extraordinary findings,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.629 align:middle line:84%
"This site is so new, they
haven't even given it a name

00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:90%
yet."

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
The discovery was made by a
British Colombian team funded

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
by the European
Research Council.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
The researchers' team
leader, a professor

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
of archeology at
Exeter University,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
and a leading
expert on the Amazon

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and pre-Columbian history,
said, "When you're there,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:90%
your emotions flow.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about several
tens of thousands of paintings.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
generations to record them.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
Every turn you do, it's
a new wall of paintings.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We started seeing animals
that are now extinct.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.860 align:middle line:84%
The pictures are
so natural and so

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:84%
well made that we have few
doubts that you're looking

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%
at a horse, for example.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The ice age horse has
a wild, heavy face.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
It's so detailed, we can
even see the horse hair.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.640 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating."

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
The site of the
discovery is so remote

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that after a two-hour drive, a
team of archeologists and film

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:84%
makers had to trek on foot for
around four hours to find it.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.618 align:middle line:84%
Even after arriving
at the site, the team

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:84%
found that some of
the paintings were

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
placed so high up
that they could only

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:90%
be viewed with drones.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Al-Shamahi remarked on the
incredible depiction of ice age

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
life in the Amazon, as suggested
by the newly discovered

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
paintings, "One of the
most fascinating things

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
was seeing ice age megafauna
because that's a marker of time.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people
realize that the Amazon has

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:90%
shifted in the way it looks.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't always
been a rainforest.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.250 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a horse or
mastodon in these paintings,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of course, they weren't
going to live in a forest.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:90%
They're too big.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Not only are they
giving clues about when

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
they were painted by some
of the earliest people--

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
that in itself is
just mind-boggling--

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
but they're also giving clues
about what this very spot might

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
have looked like,
more savanna-like."

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:90%

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, there have been
tales of beings, some human

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and some not, living in
the vast cavities that

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
exist deep beneath the
surface of the earth.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But exactly who or what these
beings are and what they want

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:90%
is open to question.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes these tales are based
on half-remembered rumors.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And there has seldom
been anything definite.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
ancient structures,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
such as the necropolis,
called the Hal Saflieni

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Hypogeum in Malta, that
helps corroborate such tales.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This strange subterranean
construction,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:84%
which dates from
around 4000 BCE,

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
is one of Europe's only known
neolithic underground dwellings.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Elsewhere, there
are several others,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
including Derinkuyu in
Turkey, the Underground

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.480 align:middle line:84%
City of Naours in
Northern France,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, the fascinating
and hauntingly beautiful city

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:90%
of Petra in Southern Jordan.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Strange indeed, but at
least we know they exist.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.710 align:middle line:84%
However, there are others
that are more questionable,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.300 align:middle line:84%
particularly those that hint
at the existence of long lost

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
One of these is the
legendary city of Shin-au-av

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.190 align:middle line:84%
that is said to lie
deep below Death

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Valley, a vast and
barren area that

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
straddles the California-Nevada
border in the USA.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:84%
This strange hidden city, whose
name means God's Land or Ghost

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Land, is thought
to have contained

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
many anomalous and
out-of-place artifacts that

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
should not belong to the era in
which it was supposedly built.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
There are two versions of how
this underground city came

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to being, although they
may be closely interlinked.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:84%
One version implies
that it is linked

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to a race that existed
at the dawn of time

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:90%
and had a presence worldwide.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:84%
They were called
the serpent people.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:10%
In India, they were known
as the nagas or snakes

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:10%
and the Quetzalcoatl or plumed
serpent in ancient Mexico.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
The ancient egyptians
called them the Djedi,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and the Chinese knew
them as lung or dragons.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Britain,
they were called adders

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:90%
or the serpents of wisdom.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Appropriately enough,
the name adder

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
is also given to a
species of poisonous snake

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that is indigenous
to areas of the UK.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem to matter
which race encountered them

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
because they were invariably
worshipped and regarded

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:90%
as helpers and prophets.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
All of the legends have
said this mysterious race

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.870 align:middle line:84%
could either take human
or reptilian form.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And as is the way with
reptiles and snakes,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
lived below the surface and
created underground cities

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
worldwide.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Under the guidance of
the serpent people,

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.560 align:middle line:84%
dragon cultures
developed, which normally

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.930 align:middle line:84%
involve the construction
of huge pyramids

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and other structures
covered with serpent motifs.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
These cultures were and ruled
by benevolent dragon kings.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And even today, signs
of vanished races

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.330 align:middle line:90%
are still evident.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, these legends
associated with the Paiute tribe

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
resonate strongly with other
native American tribes, notably

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.120 align:middle line:84%
the Hopi and Zuni peoples,
whose creation legends also

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
tell of their
ancestors' emergence

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.390 align:middle line:84%
from the dark
subterranean world.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
It is unlikely that
at the dawn of time

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.130 align:middle line:84%
these people would
have direct contact.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's strange how
closely their legends

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
have become intermingled.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
For many centuries, the
legends of the Paiute tribe

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of North America have told of
this lost city, also referred

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:90%
to as the Ghost Land.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
According to legend,
Shin-au-av was

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:84%
formed when a young
god, Shin-au-av, was

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
asked to take a sealed
bag across the desert

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and only open it when he
got to the other side.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But because he was young and he
felt movement inside the bag,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the god became
curious and opened it,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
allowing the contents, in this
case, hordes of human beings

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to escape.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
These people, who
eventually became

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
known by the name of the god,
Shin-au-av, saw some mountains

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:84%
in the distance and
ran towards them.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the older gods
saw this and demanded

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
to know why he had done this.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And a furious row developed.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
According to the legend, the
people heard the heated exchange

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:84%
but could see nothing,
so they became afraid

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and dug a tunnel
and hid in it, which

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:84%
is how the underground
city was created.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
These events became part
of Paiute creation legends

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and were adopted into their
belief of an afterlife.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Another part of this legend
tells of how many centuries

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
later the wife of a Paiute
chief died in childbirth.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And in his grief, he wanted
to be reunited with her,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:84%
so traveled to the
land of the dead.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
This involved passing through a
miles-long underground passage.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And on his journey,
he was attacked

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:84%
by the fearsome creatures
that lived there.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he got to
the end of the passage

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and found himself standing
at the end of a narrow bridge

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:90%
carved from the solid rock.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:84%
The bridge crossed what he
looked like a bottomless chasm.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:84%
He crossed the bridge
and finally arrived

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
in the land of the dead, which
was ruled over by Shin-au-av.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the inhabitants met him,
a strangely beautiful female

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.310 align:middle line:84%
with snake-like features, who
took him into a huge open area.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Here he saw thousands of dead
members of his tribe dancing.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:84%
He asked if his
wife was with them.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:84%
His guide told him she was,
and that once he had found her,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
they must both immediately
leave the valley

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and, common with Lot's
wife in the bible,

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.420 align:middle line:84%
should not on any account
look back for any reason.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
The chief promised to do this.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And he watched the
dancers for several hours

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:90%
until he saw his wife.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:90%
He called out to her.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And she turned and saw him.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
She left the dancers
and ran towards him.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And they promptly fled
to the rock ridge,

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:84%
leaving from Shin-au-av to the
cavern and the world above.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.990 align:middle line:84%
However, he forgot
his promise and turned

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
to take one look back
at where he had been.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And as he did so,
his wife and the city

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
immediately disappeared.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Once he had recovered
from the shock,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
he made his way out of the
cavern and rejoined his tribe.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:84%
He spent the rest of his life
describing the peace, happiness,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and beauty that he had found
in the underground land.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Legends like this were
forgotten until in 1947.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
They resurfaced when an article
appeared in The San Diego

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Union-Tribune.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
The article mentioned that
several years previously,

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
the remains of an
ancient civilization

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:90%
had been found in the desert.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
These remains included
an underground city

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.690 align:middle line:84%
containing gigantic
skeletons and mummies

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:90%
wearing leather clothing.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And the walls of the city were
covered with strange carvings

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:90%
and images.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
This article also stated
that in 1931, an archeologist

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.370 align:middle line:84%
had located tunnels leading
to the city underneath Death

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Valley.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
And he intended to excavate
and explore his find.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
He said that work
had already started,

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.140 align:middle line:84%
removing the skeletons from
the caverns, most of which

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:90%
were between 8 and 9 feet long.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.359 align:middle line:84%
The article also suggested
that out-of-place artifacts

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
had been found,
indicating that there

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
was a level of
technology present

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that was unlike the
rest of the find.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Like the mummies, the skeletons
were still clad in garments.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:90%
But these were made of hair.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And the garments were
of medium length,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
comprising a jacket and
knee-length trousers.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Initial testing suggested that
the remains were in the region

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:90%
of 80,000 years old.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.720 align:middle line:84%
It was also stated that
another cavern had been found.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
This cavern, which
they called the temple,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
had apparently been used
for ceremonies or rituals.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And it contained objects
and strange markings

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
familiar to those used
by the Freemasons.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
A long tunnel from this
area led to another room

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:00.020 align:middle line:84%
containing the remains of
dinosaurs, saber-toothed tigers,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:84%
elephants, and other
animals, which were displayed

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%
in alcoves in the walls.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:84%
The men got the impression that
some catastrophe had occurred

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
above ground and
people had taken refuge

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:90%
in this elaborate cave system.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The dwellings were well
equipped, and among the articles

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
found were objects that
they could not recognize.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was not until
after 1947 that they were

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:90%
found to be microwave ovens.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, it
appeared that the city

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
had been lit using a
form of gas lighting

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
which had been fueled by
sources of natural gas.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Elsewhere, there
were huge stone doors

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that seemed to
have been operated

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
using a complex system
of counterweights.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.860 align:middle line:84%
This took the form
of hundreds of globes

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.650 align:middle line:90%
dotted around the cave system.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The globes contain
pieces of stone

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that was found to be
mildly radioactive

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and is thought that
at one time may

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.640 align:middle line:90%
have provided a light source.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
In addition to this, other
totally out-of-place devices

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:84%
resembling radio
sets were also found.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:84%
However, a few days after
the first article appeared

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
in The San Diego Union-Tribune,
another article entitled

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.650 align:middle line:84%
"Expedition Reports
9-Foot Skeletons"

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
appeared in another
Nevada newspaper,

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:90%
the now defunct Hot Citizen.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:10%
Some viewed this as no more than
something created by a reporter,

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:10%
while others believe
the evidence is there

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:10%
and is being kept from
the general public.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
One account from the early
1900s alleges that two men were

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
traveling through Death Valley
and one of them allegedly fell

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
into an old mine shaft at a
place called Wingate Pass.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, he was not badly
injured and could see odd shapes

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:90%
nearby.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:84%
He called out to his companion,
who climbed down to join him.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
They found themselves
in a cavern

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
which they claim
to have followed

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
about 20 miles into the heart
of the Panamint Mountains.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:84%
They claimed to have
found themselves

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
in another cavern containing a
huge ancient underground city.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
They continued
exploring and discovered

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:84%
that they had climbed some
distance into the mountains.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And although still
underground, they

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
could see openings some
distance above the ground

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:90%
that led outside.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
They looked and realized that
the valley below had once

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
been under water and that
the openings appeared

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to have once been designed to
allow vessels to moor alongside.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
They realized that the
valley was once underwater.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And eventually came
to the conclusion

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.320 align:middle line:10%
that the arched openings
had been ancient docks

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.950 align:middle line:10%
for seagoing vessels.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
The area around Wingate
Pass, where the discoveries

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:84%
were made later, became part
of the US Navy weapons testing

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.590 align:middle line:84%
facility at China Lake and is
now off limits to the public

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and is currently impossible to
check if any of these claims

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:90%
are accurate.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
However, governments will always
conceal inconvenient evidence

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.580 align:middle line:90%
from the public.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:90%
They've done this for decades.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And this practice shows no
signs of stopping any time soon.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:84%
The Dashka Stone is a
controversial artifact

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that is believed by some
to be the guidelines used

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:84%
by the architect of the world
known as the Map of the Creator.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.390 align:middle line:84%
The stone tablet has
baffled researchers

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:90%
since its discovery in 1999.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:84%
As impossible as it may
seem, Russian experts

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
believe the stone map could
be 120 million years old.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The Dashka slab depicts not
only the environs of the Ural

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Mountains but also a series
of civil engineering projects,

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:84%
including 7,457 miles of
channels, several dams,

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and hieroglyphic notations
of unknown origin.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
The accuracy and
perspective of the map

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:84%
suggests that it was
created from an aerial point

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:90%
of observation.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyphs have not,
as of this time of writing,

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
been deciphered but are
thought to be related

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to an ancient form of Chinese.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists from the Bashkir
State University discovered

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the Dashka Stone in the Ural
Mountains of Eastern Russia

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:90%
on July the 21st, 1999.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The discoverers were
immediately struck

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:90%
by the size of the tablet.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
It measures 58 inches high, 42
inches wide, and 6 inches thick

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:90%
and weighs 1 ton.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Upon further examination,
the researchers

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:90%
were even more stunned.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The tablet appears to
show a highly accurate

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:84%
topographical map of Bashkiria,
a specific area of the Ural

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Mountains at a scale
of approximately 1

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:90%
to 1.1 kilometers.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Alexandr Chuvyrov, a professor
at Bashkir State University, who

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:84%
led the team, named
the stone Dashka

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
in honor of his grandfather,
who was born on that day.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, "At first sight, I
understood that this was not

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:84%
a simple stone piece, but a
real map, and not a single map,

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:90%
but a three-dimensional.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:90%
You can see it yourself."

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:84%
The Map of the Creator is
comprised of three levels,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.450 align:middle line:84%
strongly suggesting that it
didn't originate in nature

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:90%
but was artificially made.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The first layer is
roughly 7 inches

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:84%
of a cement or ceramic
compound based on dolomite.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:84%
The second layer
is roughly 1 inch

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
of diopside glass
enriched with silicon.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The third layer is only
a few millimeters thick

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and is made of
calcium-porcelain mixture,

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.560 align:middle line:84%
perhaps to give the
tablet added protection,

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.420 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps to create a diffused
light to better illuminate

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.300 align:middle line:90%
the stone.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:84%
"How did we manage to
identify the place?"

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:90%
Said Chuvyrov.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:10%
"At first, we couldn't imagine
the map was so ancient.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:10%
Happily, relief of
today's Bashkiria

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:10%
has not changed so much
within millions of years.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
We could identify Ufa
Height, while Ufa Canyon is

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
the main point of our proofs
because we carried out

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
geological studies and found its
track where it must be according

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.430 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient map.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Displacement of
the canyon happened

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:84%
because of tectonic slabs
which moved from east.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:84%
The group of Russian
and Chinese specialists

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:01.530 align:middle line:84%
in the field of cartography,
physics, mathematics, geology,

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, and Old
Chinese language

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:84%
managed to precisely find
out that the slab contains

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
the map of the Ural
region, with the rivers.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Belaya, Ufimka, Sutolka.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
You can also see Ufa
Canyon, the break

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
of the earth's crust stretched
out from the city of Ufa

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:90%
to the city of Sterlitamak.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, Ursak River
runs over the former canyon."

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
The Dashka Stone
undoubtedly points

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to a Ural civilization more
advanced than previously

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:90%
suspected.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.260 align:middle line:84%
However, the claims that it
was made 120 million years ago

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.960 align:middle line:84%
by a geographic creator
are most likely false.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
The Bashkir researchers
derived this date

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
from a pair of ancient seashells
found locked in the stone slab.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The first shell could be as
old as 500 million years old.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:84%
The second shell could be
as old as 120 million years.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Why these shells, still
intact, were incorporated

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.580 align:middle line:84%
into the tablet or if they
were purposely included at all,

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
they cannot be
known for certain.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Scientists suspect that,
aside from the ancient shells,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the tablet was made
approximately 3,000 years ago.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:84%
However, it's
exceedingly difficult

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to radiocarbon date the
engravings themselves.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Great attention has
been paid to the variety

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
of magnificent megalithic
structures around the world,

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
yet very little is reported on
the mysterious and impressive

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:84%
set of stone structures that
can be found in the Ural

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Mountains of Russia.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.460 align:middle line:84%
In the Sverdlovsk Oblast
region in the middle Urals,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:84%
there can be found
numerous dolmens.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:84%
According to controversial
descriptions,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:84%
a dolmen is a type of
single-chambered megalithic

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:90%
tomb.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:45.800 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
really no evidence

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that they were
initially constructed as tombs.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it seemed that
subsequent civilizations chose

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:90%
to use them for this purpose.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Dolmens are usually comprised
of two or more vertical stones

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.470 align:middle line:84%
supporting a flat
horizontal stone on top.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
There can be variations ranging
from relatively simple to very

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:90%
complex.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
The dolmens in the
Urals are considered

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to be small compared
to other dolmens,

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.560 align:middle line:84%
ranging from approximately
1.5 to 2.5 meters in width

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.460 align:middle line:90%
and length.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
There is some variance in the
dolmens of the Urals with two

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:90%
distinct styles.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The stone plate
dolmens are created

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.210 align:middle line:84%
with a mound of stones that
have an attached chamber.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
These usually have a
square court in front

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and are sometimes surrounded
by smaller stones.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
The boulder dolmens are
constructed from large boulders

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:90%
that form a chamber.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
The chamber is covered by
one or more flat stones.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.100 align:middle line:84%
There is some
variation in structure

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:90%
of the boulder dolmens.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But they all have
two entrance points--

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
a main entrance to the
side and a small entrance

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.010 align:middle line:90%
between boulders.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The menhirs are the
most typical type

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of megalith found in the Urals.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.490 align:middle line:84%
A menhir is a single
vertical stone.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
They can be found singularly
as a monolith or in groups.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:84%
The menhirs found in the Urals
include monoliths and groupings

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.360 align:middle line:90%
and tend to be roughly finished.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.750 align:middle line:84%
All of the monoliths
discovered to this point

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.720 align:middle line:84%
are located near either a
settlement or a cemetery

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
from the Bronze
Age, 3300 to 600 BC.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of the many groups are
in rows, 13 to 18 meters long.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.960 align:middle line:84%
A circular shaped structure
was discovered at the village

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.930 align:middle line:90%
of Akhunovo in Bashkiria.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Eight menhirs are formed
into a circular shape

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that is approximately
25 meters in diameter.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
While the dolmens and
menhirs are amazing

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious structures
themselves, the most amazing

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
find in the Urals are the
megaliths of Vera Island in Lake

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Turgoyak.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Dating to the Eneolithic period.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
These megaliths are referred
to as Megalith Number 1,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Megalith Number 2, Megalith
Number 3, Vera Island 9,

00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
and Vera Island 4.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
Megalith Number 1 is the
largest megalith structure

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.760 align:middle line:84%
on the island, standing
at 16 by 9 meters.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Its cut into the bedrock
and covered with capstones.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
It's orientated towards the west
and includes a long entrance,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.470 align:middle line:84%
a central hall, and two chambers
with a connecting corridor.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:84%
It includes windows and
sculptures of bulls and wolves.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It's speculated that megalith
number one served as a temple

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.910 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Megalith Number 2, pictured
in the feature image,

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:84%
was found carved into a rocky
slope with a mound structure

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
covering it.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:10%
It's orientated north and
contained two chambers connected

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.930 align:middle line:10%
by a corridor.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Megalith Number 3 is
created by large boulders

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:84%
with a square pit cut
into the center rock.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
It's closed off by
vertical stone slabs

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
with massive boulders
as capstones.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Vera Island 9 is a cultic
ritual place with two menhirs,

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
while Vera Island 4 is a
cultic place surrounded

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.880 align:middle line:84%
by vertical stones with a
small menhir in the center.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The megaliths of the Urals are
undoubtedly an impressive sight.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Yet strangely,
virtually nothing is

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
known about who created
them, how they were built,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.910 align:middle line:84%
or what purpose they
were intended to serve.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:18.400 align:middle line:84%
The megaliths stretch across
an immense area of land,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.140 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that they were not
all created by a single group.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Megalith Number 1
on Vera Island is

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:84%
believed to have been
a temple at some point.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:84%
However, other megaliths
present no obvious signs

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that they were used for
any religious purposes.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, it's
possible that the megaliths

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.170 align:middle line:84%
had a common use in spite of
the variances in size and shape.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:43.140 align:middle line:84%
It's hoped that further
archeological research may

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:47.350 align:middle line:84%
help to unravel the mysteries
of these spectacular structures,

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.730 align:middle line:84%
as well as the civilization that
created them many millennia ago.
