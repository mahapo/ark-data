00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> A few years ago when
officials in Turkey went

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
to investigate flooding
in the Nevsehir Province,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
they uncovered a vast, massive
network of underground tunnels.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Recent research has revealed
that these tunnels from

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
a subterranean city may
date back 5,000 years.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
The massive web of man-made
tunnels and caverns

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:84%
extends 3 miles underground, and
contains three stories of homes,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
places of worship, and
areas for mass congregation.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
It's now believed to be the
biggest underground city ever

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
built. Fascinatingly,
it is only one

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.430 align:middle line:84%
of perhaps 200 mysterious
underground cities

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in the Cappadocia region
of Turkey, the discovery.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Recently, an
announcement was made

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
in the media that shocked
the archaeological world.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The world's oldest
underground city

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
had been discovered in Turkey,
partly submerged underwater.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The discovery of
the ancient city

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:84%
was made in the
province of Nevsehir

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in Cappadocia, a semi-arid
region of Central Turkey.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:10%
It took place when around 1,500
houses in 11 neighborhoods

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:10%
around an ancient Byzantine
citadel in Central Nevsehir were

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:10%
being demolished by the Housing
Development Administration,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:10%
TOKi, to start a
new urban project.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:10%
The director of TOKi,
Mehmet Ergün Turan,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:10%
said, we stopped
the construction

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:10%
we were planning to
do on these areas

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:10%
when an underground
city was discovered.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Initial examination found
roughly 4.3 miles long

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.600 align:middle line:84%
underground city
of three floors,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
consisting of houses, tunnels,
churches, wine cellars, food

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:90%
storage areas, and galleries.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
The Mayor of
Nevsehir, Hasan Ünver,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
commented on the huge
importance of the find.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
He said the underground city
was found in the 45 hectares

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of the local 75-hectare area
that is within the urban

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:90%
transformation project.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We applied to the Cultural and
Natural Heritage Preservation

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Board and the area was
officially registered.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It has a 7-kilometer road
dotted with churches, galleries,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%
and other structures.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated that
the city dates back

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:84%
to the era of the
Hittites, similar

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.560 align:middle line:90%
to other underground cities.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We are now working to
make it open for visitors.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We will build walking
platforms inside

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and a large park will
be built on the surface.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
The other underground cities
in Nevsehir's various districts

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
do not even amount
to the kitchen

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:90%
of this new underground city.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Realizing the immense importance
of the discovery of the Nevsehir

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
City, authorities abruptly
halted the housing project

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and called in archaeologists
and geophysicists who began

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.070 align:middle line:90%
investigating on the site.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Uzgen Caacaea, an associate
professor at the Canakkale 18th

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
March University, who was
involved in the excavations,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:84%
believed that the tunnels at
the site were used to carry

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:90%
agricultural products.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
He said, we believe that people
who were engaged in agriculture

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:84%
were using the tunnels to
carry agricultural products

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:90%
to the city.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
We also estimate that one of the
tunnels passes under Nevsehir

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and reaches a far
away water source.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, most academics
believe that the huge network

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
of underground
houses and tunnels

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
was home to thousands
of people who

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
were part of a farming community
that existed around 3000 BC.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Local folklore talks of an
underground city in the area

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
which people call Gir-Gör, which
translates into English as enter

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:90%
and see.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Geophysicists from
Nevsehir University

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
conducted a detailed
survey of the site

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
and found it to cover almost
5 million square feet.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
The survey also suggests that
the underground corridors

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.250 align:middle line:84%
may reach down as deep
as 371 feet, which

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
would make it the largest
of all underground cities.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Mayor Hasan Ünver
commented on the results

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
of the extensive archaeological
work being carried out

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
at the site.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, we have reached
7-kilometer long galleries,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
unearthed a normal living space,
as well as a 12th-century rock

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
carved church, a
6th-century monastery,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and mosque-like religious places
which date back to the Seljuk

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:90%
era.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
We've also found horse
barns where military horses

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:90%
had been cared for.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
In addition, we
found 4 oil houses

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and 100 of tobacco pipes
made of meerschaum.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything here is
under our control.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
The newly discovered
site at Nevsehir

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
lies beneath a
Byzantine era hilltop

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
castle in an area which is
home to countless subterranean

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
settlements of varying
sizes, and possibly

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:90%
of varying dates as well.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Derinkuyu, the largest of these
is in the Derinkuyu District,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
just over 18 miles
from Nevsehir,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and goes down to a depth
of approximately 197 feet,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
equal to the height of an
eight-story building and large

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
enough to accommodate
around 20,000 people.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The massive underground city has
thousands of ventilation shafts

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:84%
and water channels, which
provided fresh air and water

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:90%
to each level of the site.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Derinkuyu was probably first
established around the 7th

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.130 align:middle line:84%
or 8th century BC, most likely
as protection against invading

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:90%
forces.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
The city was protected by doors,
which consisted of massive stone

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
wheels that could be rolled
into place to block an entrance.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:84%
One of Derinkuyu's most
interesting features

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is a large room with
vaulted ceilings, which

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:84%
is believed to have
been a religious school

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:90%
with a separate study room.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Derinkuyu was also connected
to other underground cities

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
in the region through
a sophisticated network

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of tunnels.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
These enigmatic underground
cities in Cappadocia

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:84%
were carved into the
soft volcanic rock

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But as stone is
non-organic, it's

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
difficult to accurately
date these cities.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.670 align:middle line:84%
They may have been originated
during the Hittite period

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
from 1600 to 1200
BC, or even earlier.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They're often attributed to the
Phrygians, an ancient people

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
of West Central Anatolia,
whose most famous king was

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Midas of the Golden Touch.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The state of Phrygia arose in
the region in the 8th century

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Since ancient times, Turkey
has been a major trade

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:84%
hub between Asia and
Europe, and thus has

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
been invaded and conquered
repeatedly by different peoples

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:90%
over thousands of years.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, the purpose
of these underground cities

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
is usually connected with
concealment from invaders.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
The most active
period of inhabitation

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
of these subterranean worlds
was during the Byzantine period

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:84%
from 395 AD to 1453 AD,
when regular invasions

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:84%
by foreign armies forced
locals to hide underground.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Many of these cities continued
in use right up until the 20th

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
century, when people hid
there to save themselves from

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
persecution during
the Ottoman empire.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was not until 1923,
after the population exchange

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
between Greece and Turkey,
that these underground cities

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
were finally abandoned and
not rediscovered until 1963.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, Derinkuyu
is the largest excavated

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:90%
underground city in the world.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But many believe that when
Nevsehir is fully excavated,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that title may
well change hands.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Kaymakli.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:10%
There are a staggering 200
or more underground towns

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.770 align:middle line:10%
and cities in
Cappadocia, many of which

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:10%
are wholly or partly
open to the public.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the best known of them
is Kaymakli underground town,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:84%
located about 12
miles from Nevsehir

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and built under the hill known
as the citadel of Kaymakli.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to Derinkuyu
by miles of ancient tunnels

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and was opened to
visitors as early as 1964.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
The subterranean town consists
of eight floors, four of which

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:90%
are open to the public today.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
The spaces in the
underground town

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
which are organized
around ventilation shafts,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
were made into stables, storage
rooms, wineries, and kitchens.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists believe this
underground village could have

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
been a temporary home
for up to 3,500 people.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
On the third level
of the settlement,

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
archeologists discovered
an unusual block

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
of andesite, which was used
by the ancient inhabitants

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:90%
for cold-forming copper.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The ancient name of
the town was Enegup,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and expert believe construction
may have begun by the Phrygians

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:90%
in the 8th to 7th centuries BC.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It was used much later in the
Byzantine era for protection

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
against Muslim Arabs during
the Arab-Byzantine wars

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of 780 to 1180 AD.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The modern village
on the site is

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
built almost around 100 tunnels
of the underground city.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
These tunnels are still
used today by the villagers

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
as storage areas,
stables and cellars,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
accessed via the courtyards
of the houses in the village.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:84%
There is actually an
astonishing eyewitness account

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
of these underground
Cappadocian cities,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
which gives us a vivid idea of
what they must have been like.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:84%
It was written in 370 BC by
the ancient Greek professional

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
soldier and writer
Xenophon, and tells

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
of the expedition of a large
army of Greek mercenaries

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
hired by Persian Prince
Cyrus the Younger,

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to help him seize the throne
of Persia from his brother.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
During their travels, they
came upon a strange village

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in Anatolia, modern
Turkey, which Xenophon describes

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:84%
as follows, "The
houses were underground

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
with a mouth like that of
a well, but spacious below.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And while entrances
were tunneled down

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
for the beasts of burden,
the human inhabitants

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:90%
descended by ladder.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:84%
In the houses, were
goats, sheep, cattle, fowl

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and their young,
and all the animals

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
were reared and took their
fodder there in the houses.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Here were also wheat,
barley, and beans,

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:90%
and barley wine in large bowls.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Floating on the top of this
drink were the barley grains,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and in it were straws, some
larger and others smaller

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:90%
without joints.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And when one was thirsty
one had to take these straws

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:90%
into his mouth and suck.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It was an extremely strong
drink unless one diluted it with

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:84%
water, and extremely good
when one was used to it."

00:10:52.150 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Researchers believe
they have uncovered

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
the first clear example of a
treasure the ancient Egyptians

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:11.220 align:middle line:84%
brought home with them from the
legendary lost land of Punt.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It is a 3300-year-old
baboon skull,

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
a remnant of an animal that was
revered in ancient Egypt but was

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
not native to the
land of the Pharaohs.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:90%
The legendary treasures of Punt.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians wrote
about the land of Punt

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and depicted it as a prosperous
location from 2450 BC

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:90%
to 1155 BC.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:84%
They went to Punt, which they
referred to as god's land

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.470 align:middle line:84%
to acquire gold, African
blackwood, ebony, ivory,

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
aromatic raisins, wild
animals, and slaves.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the most famous artworks
created about this location

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is the Punt colonnade
on Hatshepsut's temple

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
at Deir el-Bahari, demonstrating
that her people brought

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
her myrrh trees, gold, ivory,
panther skins, and apes back

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:90%
from Punt.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
The travels to
Punt for treasures

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
also demonstrate the ancient
Egyptians nautical skills.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Nathaniel Dominy,
a primatologist

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
at Dartmouth College and
lead author of the new study,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.150 align:middle line:84%
explained that the long
distance seafaring between Egypt

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and Punt, two
sovereign entities,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
was a major milestone
in human history

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.260 align:middle line:84%
because it drove the evolution
of maritime technology.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Trade in exotic luxury
goods, including baboons,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:84%
was the engine behind
early nautical innovations.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists believe
that the land of the Punt

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
was a real place.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
However, there is still
a debate about where

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:90%
it was actually located.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Ethiopia, Eritrea, and
Somalia are just a few

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:90%
of the proposed locations.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why researchers have
taken a particular interest

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
in the 3300-year-old
baboon skull.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.470 align:middle line:10%
If this baboon really
did come from Punt,

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:10%
and they could
identify its homeland,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:10%
the mystery may be solved.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:10%
Dominy states in a press
release, "Many scholars view

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:10%
trade between Egypt and Punt
as the first long maritime

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:10%
step in a trade network
known as the Spice route,

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.250 align:middle line:10%
which would go on to shape
geopolitical fortunes

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:10%
for millennia.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Other scholars put
it more simply,

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
describing the
Egypt-Punt relationship

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
as the beginning of
economic globalization.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Baboons were central
to this commerce,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
so determining the location
of Punt is important."

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.060 align:middle line:84%
For over 150 years, Punt has
been a geographic mystery.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Dominy says, "Our analysis is
the first to show how mummified

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
baboons can be used to
inform this enduring debate."

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Analyzing the baboon
skull, even though there

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
are records and artwork
listing and depicting

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
the goods Egyptians
took from Punt,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Science magazine reports
that archeologists

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
have found little hard evidence
for treasures from Punt to date.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Dominy and his colleagues
believe that their research

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
will change that.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.510 align:middle line:84%
They identified a hamadryas
baboon skull tucked away

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
in the British Museum's archives
and think that the fossil that

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
was discovered in Thebes,
Luxor in the 19th century,

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:90%
came from Punt.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
The results of their study,
published on "eLife,"

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
explains that they studied
the chemical isotopes

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:84%
in the baboon's tooth
enamel to try to pinpoint

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:90%
the animal's birthplace.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Isotopic analysis is a
useful tool for this endeavor

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
because different places have
distinct ratios of strontium

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:90%
isotopes in the soil and water.

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And this isotopic signature of
the place where the animal lives

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
the first years of their life
is seen in their tooth enamel,

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the water they drink
and the food they consume.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:10%
No matter where the animal
lives later in life,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:10%
their homeland's
isotopic signature

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:10%
remains in their tooth
enamel, unaltered by time.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:84%
The results of the chemical
analysis of the baboon's skull

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.790 align:middle line:84%
show that the animal
wasn't born in Egypt.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:10%
In their paper, the researchers
write that it came from a region

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:10%
that it encompasses much of
present-day Ethiopia, Eritrea,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:10%
and Djibouti, and portions
of Somalia and Yemen.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:84%
They write that this region
corroborates the balance

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
of scholarly conjecture
on the location of Punt,

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and also is a testament to the
tremendous reach of Egyptian

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
seafaring during the
2nd millennium BC.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Dominy says that this implies
the baboon is the first

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:10%
known Puntite treasure.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
According to "Science"
magazine, Kathryn Bard,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
an archaeologist at
Boston University,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
said that the baboon's skull
study provides another piece

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
of evidence on where
Punt was located.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Bard believes that
Punt is either

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.840 align:middle line:90%
in Eritrea or Eastern Sudan.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
She also told Science
magazine that this

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:84%
isn't the first example
of a treasure from Punt

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
because her excavations
at Mersa/Wadi Gawasis

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
unearthed obsidian ebony
fragments, which she asserts

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:90%
came from Punt.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Dominy disagreed, saying
that ebony, for example,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
was widely distributed
across Africa,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
so Bard's discovery
was not necessarily

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:90%
a treasure from Punt.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.110 align:middle line:84%
High-status baboons
in ancient Egypt.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
linked hamadryas baboons

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to their god of wisdom and
the creator of hieroglyphics,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Thoth and Amun-Ra, the sun god.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
They considered the animals
sacred and depicted them

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:84%
in their sculptures,
reliefs, and paintings,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.190 align:middle line:84%
even though they're not
native animals to Egypt.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologist Dr. Geraldine Pinch
has also noted that baboons were

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
connected with Duat, the
underworld in ancient Egyptian

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.800 align:middle line:84%
religion, saying, "The image of
the Thoth baboon beside a wedjat

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
eye occurs on magic wands as
early as the 20th century BC.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Two baboon form of the god Khons
controlled "The Book of the End

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:90%
of the Year."

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:10%
These contained lists of
those who were destined to die

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:10%
and those who would live."

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Anand Balaji has
written that baboons

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:84%
were associated with
ancient Egyptian kings too.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, King
Narmer is shown

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:84%
as being transformed into a
baboon known as the Great White

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.770 align:middle line:84%
One as part of a
rejuvenation festival seen.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Balaji noticed that
some scholars opine

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
that the title of
this god is derived

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:84%
from the silver-gray mane
of a dominant hamadryas,

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and individual ancestors
were ritually deified

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.700 align:middle line:84%
in the form of baboons and
received cultic offerings.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
When archeologists were
excavating a dried-up lagoon

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
known as Mersa Gawasis,
they discovered

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
traces of an ancient
harbor that had

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
helped launch early
voyages like Hatshepsut's

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.860 align:middle line:90%
onto the open ocean.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Man-made caves in the area
contain timber, rigging,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:84%
limestone anchors, steering
oars, reed mats, cedar planks,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and the remains of one
of the oldest seagoing

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:90%
ships ever discovered.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
These artifacts
have offered proof

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
of the Egyptians nautical
skills and also provided

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
important clues to
the location of Punt.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.970 align:middle line:84%
A more recent discovery
adds weight to the evidence

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
that Punt was located
somewhere in Africa, and not

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:90%
on the Arabian Peninsula.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:10%
Science in Poland reports that
archeologists and ornithologists

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:10%
have identified a depiction of
a bird on the portico of Punti

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:10%
in the temple of Hatshepsut
as a secretary bird,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:10%
Sagittarius serpentarius.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.640 align:middle line:10%
A very large bird of prey found
only in Africa, particularly

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:10%
around coastal regions in Sudan.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.590 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, the
land of Punt has

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
been delegated to the
realm of myth and folklore.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:10%
But more and more
recent findings

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:10%
are making it clear that Punt
was not a mythical place,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:10%
it's a real location that is
still waiting to be found.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:90%
