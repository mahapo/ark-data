>> Researchers in Turkey are
about to embark on an excavation

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:10%
at the ancient site
of Karahan Tepe,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.480 align:middle line:10%
and they believe it's much
older than Gobekli Tepe,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:10%
the famous zero point
of world history.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask any
professor of history or even

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
a self-respecting
armchair archeologist

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to name the oldest monument ever
discovered, they would have all

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:90%
said Gobekli Tepe.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But now, that answer
might be Karahan Tepe.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is creating
a lot of excitement

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.633 align:middle line:90%
in archeological circles.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:44.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Karahan Tepe is said to be
much older than Gobekli Tepe.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists have been
working at the Karahan Tepe

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
site, which is often called
the sister site of Gobekli Tepe

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:90%
since 1997.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The site is located near
Yagmurlu and roughly 35 east

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.350 align:middle line:84%
of the 12,000 year
old Gobekli Tepe site.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Over the years,
archeologists have

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
made a series of
amazing discoveries

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that the Karahan Tepe
site, in particular,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.280 align:middle line:84%
tons of buried T-shaped
obelisks, similar to the ones

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
carved with wild
animals at Gobekli Tepe,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
have led researchers to
conclude that Karahan Tepe is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
much older than its younger
sister, Gobekli Tepe.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Head of excavations at
Karahan Tepe, Dr. Necmi Karul

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
said that 12 spots estimated
to be in the same period

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
as Gobekli Tepe are now known
in the region, one of which

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
is the Karahan Tepe.

Congress, culture
and tourism minister,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Mehmet Nuri Ersoy said that an
intensive and rapid excavation

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
program continues
in Karahan Tepe,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.620 align:middle line:84%
which to date has yielded
250 obelisks featuring animal

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.760 align:middle line:90%
figures.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Ersoy claims that planned
excavations will prove

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
the settlement at Karahan
Tepe will be much older than

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:84%
the 12,000 year
old Gobekli Tepe.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
A 2016 National
Geographic article

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.920 align:middle line:84%
recounted the fascinating
story of the discovery

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and preservation
of Gobekli Tepe.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:10%
Professor Klaus Schmidt,
a German archeologist

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:10%
who led excavations
at the site, argued

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:10%
before he died in 2014 that
a vast labor force needed

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:10%
to build the enclosures and that
this construction project pushed

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:10%
people to develop agriculture
as a way of providing

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:10%
predictable food and
perhaps drink for workers.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:84%
At the 2015 World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Turkey's Dogus Group
announced that they

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
plan to spend $50 million
over the next 20 years

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in partnership with the
National Geographic Society

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.380 align:middle line:90%
on the Gobekli Tepe site.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And Dogus Group chairman
Ferit Faik Sahenk,

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
said in a press release that the
reason so much cash was being

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
spent on Gobekli Tepe was
because this prehistoric temple

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
was the zero point in time.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Karahan Tepe may well be
Gobekli Tepe's older sister.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
While Gobekli Tepe holds the
world record in media headlines

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere as the earliest
temple of its type ever

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:84%
discovered, there are
several other contenders

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.950 align:middle line:90%
for this crown in Turkey.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
According to Jens
Notroff, an archeologist

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
at the German
Archeological Institute who

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
is working on Gobekli Tepe site,
smaller versions of the pillars,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
symbols, and architecture
carved into stone Gobekli Tepe

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
have been found in settlements
up to 125 miles away, including

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Karahan Tepe.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Professor Notroff told
National Geographic

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that Gobekli Tepe
probably served the region

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
as a cathedral, and therefore
the surrounding sacred sites

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:90%
were like parish churches.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:10%
The scientist also thinks
hunter gatherers traveled

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:10%
long distances to meet,
worship, and help build

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:10%
new monumental structures
through vast community

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:10%
projects that included grand
feasts to display wealth.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Returning to Karahan Tepe,
according to a report in "Daily

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Sabah," many more years of
excavations and research must be

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
conducted to determine what
exactly it was used for.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.150 align:middle line:84%
However, while it does
happen, scientists seldom

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
make big claims without
equally big proof.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And in this instance, the
researchers think that when they

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
ultimately get to Karahan
Tepe's excavation center,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:84%
it will be much older
than 12,000 years.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The archeologists
at Karahan Tepe

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
are also convinced that
they have a new zero

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:90%
point in World history.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The mayor says the site will
become a priority in place

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of Gobekli Tepe
and it will become

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:84%
a new focus of national
archeological and tourist

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:90%
attention.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Karahan Tepe is the sister
to the enigmatic Gobekli Tepe

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
that sits around 23 miles
southeast of Gobekli

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
upon an elevated
limestone ridge.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:84%
It has many striking
similarities to Gobekli.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, it consists of
T-shaped pillars, 266 of them

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:90%
that mostly form parallel rows.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
The pillars have
relief carvings,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and the site appears
like Gobekli,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:84%
to be deliberately buried
under a great artificial mound.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Although this could be
natural as after 10,500 years

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of accumulation of dirt combined
with high winds could have

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:90%
covered it back up.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:10%
The comparisons
do not end there.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
It also has serpent relief
carvings, strange rock

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
indentations, large cut
marks, porthole stones,

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and an unfinished
T-shaped pillar

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.505 align:middle line:84%
still in the quarry, the
focus of this article.

00:06:49.505 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Karahan Tepe was first
discovered in 1997

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and was surveyed in
2000 and again in 2011.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Like Gobekli Tepe, it's
located within the boundaries

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of Sanliurfa, ancient Edessa,
the birthplace of Abraham

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:90%
around 30 miles from the city.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not an officially
recognized tourist site,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
so they had to plan
their trip carefully

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
as it was on private land
upon the Tektek mountains.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, a well placed,
probably modern standing stone

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
marked the entrance
to the track that

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
led to the farm that
is located behind.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
When Andrew Collins
visited there in 2004,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
the person who showed
him around was warned he

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
would get a beating if they
found anyone had visited there.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:84%
10 years later, and the owners
welcomed the occasional visitor

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
with tea and information.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
No beatings entailed, just sweet
hot beverages and conversation

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:90%
after the morning visit.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The dating of the
site is impressive

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
as it's dated to
8500 BC, contemporary

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
with the now
submerged Nevali Cori

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and the later stages
of Gobekli Tepe.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There are obvious
similarities to these

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and other sites in the
vicinity, but we've

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:84%
heard that there was
a quarry on site where

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.160 align:middle line:84%
an unfinished T-shaped pillar
still sits within the bedrock.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Kevin Fish diligently searched
for it with only one clue,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that it was directly to the
west of the main enclosure,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:90%
as mentioned in the 2011 report.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Kevin eventually converged
at the impressive monolith.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It lies on a rock face sloping
30 degrees towards the setting

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:90%
sun.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:84%
At 18 feet long, it would
probably been the largest

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:90%
monolith at the site.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.990 align:middle line:84%
The site is not excavated yet,
so this can't be confirmed.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And weighs in at
around 30 to 40 tons.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Its downward angle on the slope
on natural exposed rock face

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
may have been why this was a
preferred spot to quarry from.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
As archeologist
Bahattin Çelik explains,

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.080 align:middle line:84%
this is quite a practical
technique with roughly chiseling

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.630 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the rock
to produce a T shape,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
whilst carving the other
side 40 centimeters wide

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and 1 meter deep.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The solid pillar separated from
the bedrock with this technique

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and can easily be
removed from the quarry

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:90%
with the help of a slope.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins
decided to measure it,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and discovered it was indeed
18 feet, 5.5 meters in length,

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
with a maximum width
of 6.6 feet, 2 meters

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:90%
across its T-shaped head.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
This is similar in size
to the twin monoliths

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
at the center of
Gobekli's enclosure,

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.540 align:middle line:84%
C and D. The weathering
was very bad,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
much like the exposed parts of
the pillars on the main hill.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:84%
However, what lies underneath
could be as well preserved

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:90%
as Gobekli Tepe.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Altogether, Karahan Tepe
is a fascinating site

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that begs excavation
as the significance

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
of the nearby Gobekli Tepe
has now hit the headlines.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
After leaving the
site, the visitor

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
wondered if the location of the
choice of rock was significant.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Was the direction of the
quarry from the main temple

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
an indication of a tradition
that existed as far back

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:90%
as 10,500 years ago?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins discussed
the possibility

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that indeed it could be the
case as bringing quarried stone

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:84%
from the west to the
east may represent

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
bringing it into
the light, sunrise

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:90%
from darkness, the sunset.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:84%
However, the remaining
14 foot pillar

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
still on the eastern slope had
further avenues slightly further

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:90%
East of it.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, it showed a possible
west to east movement.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, it could also
represent an east to west

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
direction from the smaller
quarry to the main enclosure.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
After searching through
some masonic texts,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
a reference was
found to a ceremony

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where the initiate had to move
in that direction, east to west.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Why this is perhaps could
represent facing one's own death

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
as initiation
rites such as these

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
are often about facing
deep rooted fears.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Whether this was on the minds
of the builders of Karahan Tepe,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:84%
we'll never know, unless, of
course, the site gets excavated

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:90%
and evidence emerges.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:90%
For now, we can only speculate.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect that
grabbed Andrew's attention

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.900 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that the
parallel rows appeared

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to be serpent-like, weaving
up or down the main hill

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:90%
or from the main enclosure.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
In his initial
report, Andrew stated,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:84%
"It's even possible that the
zigzagging pairs of stones

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.530 align:middle line:84%
making up the stone avenues
located on the northern eastern

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.900 align:middle line:84%
sides of the Tepe signify
the path of snakes,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.160 align:middle line:84%
which are seen to descend like
living energy into the valley

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.010 align:middle line:90%
below."

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
This idea is given
credence through the fact

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
that carving on the stone
seems directed up the hill as

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:84%
if the direction of
movement is downward

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.660 align:middle line:84%
through the various
sets of gateways.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.690 align:middle line:84%
After coming to this
conclusion, Andrew

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
dreamed of snakes, their
tails tied together,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
each one trying to break free
of its bondage, all of them

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
writhing about in the process.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
With this dream
came the impression

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that the snakes represented the
containment, flow, and energy

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of these stones
avenues at Karahan

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Tepe, an interesting
concept if nothing else.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:10%
Earth energy springs
to mind as it

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:10%
has been found in Avebury,
Brittany and Cornwall

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:10%
that stone avenues mark the
path of telluric Earth energy

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:10%
currents with a
crossing point often

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:10%
at the center of the complex,
which would naturally congregate

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:10%
on a hilltop.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
More research needs
to be carried out

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:90%
to confirm this hypothesis.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But with the serpent symbolism
at such a remote site,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
it could even reveal the origins
of geomancy and Earth energy

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:90%
science.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
When they go back
in September, they

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
will have some equipment to
take readings and dowsing

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
rods to find out if
this is the case.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Divers working on
a submarine project

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in McDonald Lake in the
Haliburton Forest and Wildlife

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:90%
Reserve.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
Ontario, Canada, discovered a
submerged manmade ancient stone

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
structure, possibly 5,000
to 10,000 years old.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:84%
For some, this is
irrefutable evidence

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
of a long lost civilization
that inhabited the region

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.050 align:middle line:90%
before the last ice age.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
One or two researchers
have linked the discovery

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to Canada's Stonehenge, a huge
5,000 year old stone wheel

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:90%
discovered South of Alberta.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Who were the people
who constructed

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:90%
these mysterious monuments?

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And what do they represent?

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.030 align:middle line:84%
The Haliburton Forest and
Wildlife Reserve Limited

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
is a privately-owned forest
comprising 120 square miles

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
in Haliburton County,
Ontario, Canada.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
The owner-manager of the
25,000-hectare Haliburton Forest

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Peter Schleifenbaum who
inherited it from his father.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Recently, various
sources on the net

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
carried a story about
a submarine survey

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of McDonald Lake, a popular
tourist attraction, which

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:90%
apparently took place in 2008.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
According to the story,
during the survey,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:84%
divers encountered an
ancient stone structure,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
which was thought to be
proof of the presence

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
of a mysterious ancient culture
in the area, life from Central

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Ontario ancestors.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Staff at the Haliburton
Forest and Wildlife Reserve

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:84%
would often see this unusual
stone structure balanced

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
on the top of a rock ledge
at a depth of about 40 feet

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
below the present lake
level whilst in the tours

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
submarine, which
was in existence

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:41.110 align:middle line:90%
for a few years at the site.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The structure consists of
a 1,000 pound elongated

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
south-pointing rock, sitting on
a baseball-sized stone at each

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
side, which in turn
rested on a massive slab.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Initially, the structure was
considered a complex version

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of a glacial erratic, rocks
carried by glaciers thousands

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of years ago and left
where they happened

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to melt at the end of one
of the recent ice ages.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
However, when various
geologists and archeologists

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
examined images on the
subject, some expressed doubts

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:90%
about its natural origin.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.430 align:middle line:84%
The main objection
was that the structure

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
has straight edges
rather than rounded,

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
which would normally
characterize

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:90%
rock scoured by glaciers.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
One alternative was that
the mysterious structure

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
was manmade.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was, how
could that be established?

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.660 align:middle line:84%
The Haliburton Forest and
Wildlife Reserve Limited

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
decided to hire an underwater
archeologist to examine

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:90%
the structure more closely.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, after a brief
examination of the structure,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.280 align:middle line:84%
this unnamed
archeologist concluded

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that it was undoubtedly the
result of human activity

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than an
accident of nature.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
The company also
employed a statistician

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
to calculate the probability
of these seven rocks

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
in the lake falling
on top of each other

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:84%
to create what looked
like a structure.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The statistician determined
that the probability

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of seven rocks falling
into such positions

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:84%
at the right time and place
was almost impossible.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But if the structure was
manmade, what was it?

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Who built it and when?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers think it
resembled the prehistoric stone

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
cairns found throughout the
world, which serve as monuments,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.240 align:middle line:84%
burial sites, markers for
ceremonial land, or even

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:90%
navigational aids.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Others think it may be a burial
chamber or perhaps a dolmen.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Dolmens are a type of single
chamber megalithic tomb,

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
mostly dating from the early
Neolithic, 4000 to 3000 BC,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
found in a variety of
places throughout the world,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:84%
but mostly in Northwest
Europe, particularly

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
in the region of Brittany,
France, Britain, and Ireland.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The thick layer of
silt covering some

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
of the surfaces
of the structures

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:90%
indicate that they are very old.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, without
further evidence,

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:84%
it was impossible to
say when it was built.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
However, when geologists
were consulted on the matter,

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
they apparently
pointed to a drought,

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
which may have hit Eastern North
America between 9000 and 7000

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:84%
At this time,
conditions were so dry

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that water levels
in the Great Lakes

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:90%
were as much as 165 feet lower.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And inland lakes
like McDonald Lake

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
may well have been at
least 40 feet lower

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:90%
than their current levels.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
If the structure of
the McDonald Lake

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is a prehistoric
monument of some kind,

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.780 align:middle line:84%
why was it situated in
such a remote place?

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:84%
One theory is that the sparse
local population at the time

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%
may have been attracted
to the spot by lake trout,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.650 align:middle line:84%
often described
as glacial relict,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
as they are a holdover
from the ice age

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and live mainly in deep
cold water habitats.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
One geologist suggested
that in prehistoric times,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
McDonald Lake was
not a lake at all,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:84%
but part of an ancient
river system, which made

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:90%
an ideal habitat for the trout.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
But no prehistoric monuments
of the cairn or dolmen type

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
exist in the USA,
Canada, or anywhere else

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in the world dated to
anywhere near 9000 to 7000 BC.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Does that make this structure
the oldest in the world?

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Or should the glacial, erratic
theory be examined further?

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:84%
However attractive these
explanations for the Lake

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:84%
McDonald structure being a
prehistoric monument are,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.130 align:middle line:84%
without further evidence
obtained in an independent study

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
or excavation unconnected
with the Haliburton Forest

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and Wildlife Reserve Limited
such as contemporary artifacts

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:84%
or signs of manmade tooling
marks on the stones,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.850 align:middle line:90%
we cannot say this for sure.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.040 align:middle line:84%
There are one or
two researchers who

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
have linked the
underwater structure

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:84%
at Lake McDonald to a
mysterious monument known

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
as Canada's Stonehenge.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:10%
This would make the Lake
McDonald prehistoric structure

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.570 align:middle line:10%
later in date, say, around
3000 BC, though still

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.400 align:middle line:10%
unique to the area.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:10%
In his 2008 book,
"Canada's Stonehenge,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Astounding Archeological
Discoveries in Canada, England,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:10%
and Wales," author Gordon R.
Freeman puts forward the theory

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient structure
is a prehistoric calendar.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
A summary of the book on
Freeman's website states,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
"The discovery of a $5,000 year
old sun temple and an ancient

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
time machine, Stonehenge
calendar in Canada led scientist

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Gordon Freeman to groundbreaking
discoveries in Stonehenge."

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:84%
During fieldwork and
research from 1986 to 2006,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Freeman found striking
similarities between the surface

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:90%
geometry of the two sites.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.630 align:middle line:84%
These similarities push back the
boundaries of written history

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and have far
reaching implications

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
for North American
and European history.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Could the same mysterious
ancient cultures

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:84%
have built Canada's Stonehenge
and the Lake McDonald structure?

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were both related
to ancient astronomical

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:90%
observations.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Freeman describes
what he discovered

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
at the ancient site of Canada's
Stonehenge, located in Vulcan

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:90%
County, Alberta, in his book.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
"I have found an amazingly
accurate year-round calendar

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.180 align:middle line:84%
in this sun temple, marked with
rock lines pointing to sun rises

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.440 align:middle line:90%
and sets at critical dates.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I later learned of arguments
going on, mainly negative,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
about whether Stonehenge
contained marked observation

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
lines to the summer solstice
sunrise and the winter solstice

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
sunset.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.920 align:middle line:84%
By applying what I had learned
in Alberta to observing sun

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:84%
rises and sets
through Stonehenge,

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I found that an accurate entire
year-round calendar exists

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in Stonehenge."

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
The term Canada's
Stonehenge refers

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:84%
to the monument known by
archeologists and historians

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:90%
as Majorville Medicine Wheel.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
There are between 70 and 150
Native American stone structures

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:84%
known as medicine wheels spread
over the Northern United States

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:90%
and Southern Canada.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:10%
Though each individual
structure is unique,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:10%
the shape of the most common
type of medicine wheel

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:10%
resembles that of a wagon
wheel lying on its side,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:10%
with a central cairn from which
lines of cobblestone radiate

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:10%
outwards to a surrounding
ring of stones.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The diameter of medicine wheels
as well as the number and length

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:90%
of their spokes varies.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.180 align:middle line:84%
The largest so far
discovered, has

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
a diameter of around 80 feet.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, there will be a
break in the outer stone circle

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to allow a stone pathway
or entrance into the center

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:90%
of the structure.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes one of the spokes
can be considerably longer

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
than the others,
perhaps signifying

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.630 align:middle line:84%
the importance of the direction
in which it's pointing.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The dates of these medicine
wheels also vary considerably,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:84%
but it is acknowledged that the
oldest so far investigated is

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
the Majorville Medicine Wheel,
which was started around 5,500

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt
that the wheel may

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:84%
have served some
astronomical function,

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
but it is more
probable that this

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
would have been part
of a wider ritual use,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.660 align:middle line:84%
perhaps involving hunting,
magic, or buffalo fertility.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:10%
This is not to say that Native
Americans were not sophisticated

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:10%
enough to build observatories,
far from it, but in one sense,

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:10%
to state that the Majorville
Medicine Wheel was built only

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:10%
to make complex astronomical
calculations is to apply modern

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Western ideas from a 21st
century technology-dominated era

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:10%
back into the past.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
This explanation
reflects our own concerns

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
with timekeeping, calendars,
computers, and space,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily those
of the Native Americans

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.916 align:middle line:84%
who built and used
Canada's Stonehenge.

00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The Maltese archipelago
consists of five islands

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Central
Mediterranean Sea.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Positioned 60 miles to
the South of Sicily,

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.290 align:middle line:84%
only three of these
islands are inhabited,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Malta Island, which is the
largest, along with Gozo

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and Comino.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Malta has a long history going
back at least 7,000 years with

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.850 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of
archeological remains,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
from the megalithic temples
and underground chambers

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
of prehistory to the Baroque
architecture of the medieval

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
The most spectacular and
enigmatic of the ancient remains

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
on Malta are the Neolithic
temples and tombs built 1,000

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:90%
years before the pyramids.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And Malta has the oldest
free-standing stone buildings

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.520 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
fascinating and mysterious

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
of these megalithic
structures is known

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:90%
as the Hal-Saflieni hypogeum.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:10%
A hypogeum is a subterranean
rock-cut chamber

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:10%
of an ancient
building, and there

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:10%
are a number of these
type of monuments spread

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.520 align:middle line:10%
across the Mediterranean
in Southern France, Sicily,

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:10%
Sardinia, and Crete.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The Hal-Saflieni hypogeum is
an underground tomb and temple

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
complex extending for
around 5380 square feet,

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and is located in the
town of Paola, which is

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:90%
in the south of Malta island.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.720 align:middle line:84%
The site was discovered
by accident in 1902

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
when workers digging
cisterns for new houses

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
above broke through the
roof of one of the chambers.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The first excavations
at the site

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:84%
were performed by
Father Emmanuel

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Magri of the Society of
Jesus and later continued

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Temi Zammit, the first
curator of Malta's museums

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:90%
department.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Between 1905 and
1911, Zammit excavated

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating collection
of Archeological material

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
from the complex, including
human remains, pottery, beads,

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%
amulets, and figurines.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote a series
of reports of his work

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:84%
at the site that was
published from 1910 onward.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
The hypogeum was first
opened to the public in 1908

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
while excavations were
still taking place.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:10%
The Hal-Saflieni
hypogeum consists

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:10%
of a series of oval
chambers, halls,

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:10%
and niches set on three levels,
one underneath the other.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, the
underground structures

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
were all carved out of solid
rock in semi-darkness, allegedly

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
using stone mallets
and antler picks

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and later smoothed over
using flint implements.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The upper level of
the complex consists

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.800 align:middle line:84%
of a hollow with a central
passageway with burial chambers

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:84%
cut into the natural
caves on each side.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the oldest level
of the hypogeum in use

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
from 3600 BC to 3300
BC, and is similar

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
and plan to earlier
rock-cut cut tombs

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
found elsewhere on the islands
such as the Xemxija tombs, which

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
date to around 4000 BC.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The middle level,
3300 to 3000 BC,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
was cut into the subsurface
rock as an extension

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
of the upper level
of the structure.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.960 align:middle line:84%
This level exhibits
exquisite stoneworking skill

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.820 align:middle line:84%
in the elaborately
carved trilithons,

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:84%
which are a
construction with two

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:84%
upright posts with a
horizontal one set on top.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.480 align:middle line:84%
The trilithons are
set in imitation

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of the built masonry
of the above ground

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
megalithic structures
found elsewhere on Malta.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:84%
This level also contains some
of the most important features

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
of the hypogeum monument, such
as the main chamber, the Oracle

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Room, and the Holy
of the Holies.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of the wall surfaces
in the main chamber

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.010 align:middle line:84%
originally had a
wash of red ocher,

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
tracing out spiral and
honeycomb designs, some of which

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:90%
are still visible today.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:10%
The famous Sleeping Lady, a
12 centimeter long reclining

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.140 align:middle line:10%
terracotta figure with
traces of red ocher,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:10%
was recovered either from
here or a nearby room, which

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.470 align:middle line:10%
is known as the Snake Pit.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Believed to date
from around 3000 BC,

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:10%
this corpulent ceramic
figure is naked to the waist

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:10%
and wears a fringed skirt.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:10%
She appears to be in a deep,
tranquil sleep on a bed

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:10%
with a rush mattress.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.970 align:middle line:10%
Along with other
similar figurines

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:10%
from the Neolithic
sites on Malta

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:10%
and elsewhere in
the Mediterranean,

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:10%
the sleeping lady has
been used as evidence

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.210 align:middle line:10%
for the theory of universal
peace-loving mother

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.560 align:middle line:10%
goddess or great goddess
worship in prehistory proposed

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.480 align:middle line:10%
by a number of researchers.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:84%
One interesting theory
regarding the sleeping lady,

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
whether goddess or not, is that
either in a trance or asleep,

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:84%
she may represent a
place in the hypogeum

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.150 align:middle line:84%
where dreams or trance
visions were interpreted

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:90%
by priests or priestesses.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:10%
Such a dark,
subterranean context

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:10%
would have been ideal for the
stimulation of such states

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:10%
as it would induce
dreams and visions.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, because the
area was used for burials,

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.060 align:middle line:84%
the statue may be a
representation of eternal sleep.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:10%
The enigmatic
sleeping lady figurine

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:10%
is now on display
at the National

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.960 align:middle line:10%
Museum of Archeology
in Valletta,

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:10%
the capital city of Malta.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Also on the middle level, the
roughly rectangular Oracle Room

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.340 align:middle line:84%
has an elaborately
decorated ceiling

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.100 align:middle line:84%
of ocher-painted spirals and
a fascinating side chamber,

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
which has the property
to amplify and echo

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:90%
a deep human voice.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
This is referred to as
a resonance chamber.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether this intriguing
effect was intentional or not

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
is difficult to say,
though the possibility

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that these strange
acoustics were utilized

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
in some religious ceremonies
performed in the chambers

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.030 align:middle line:90%
is an intriguing one.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.510 align:middle line:84%
The chamber resonates at
an intriguing 111 hertz,

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:84%
which is known to be
a healing frequency.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Immersing yourself
in this frequency

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
can help increase
the healing process

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:90%
of internal and external wounds.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.720 align:middle line:84%
The Holy of the Holies is
perhaps the most elaborately

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:84%
decorated room in
the whole complex,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
with its trilithon door frame
and pierced stone or porthole

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.140 align:middle line:84%
entrance, reflecting
the architecture

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.860 align:middle line:84%
of Maltese free-standing
Neolithic monuments.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The third and lowest
level at the hypogeum

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is 35 feet below
street level and has

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:90%
been dated to 3150 to 2500 BC.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:10%
It consists of a
maze of chambers,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:10%
which were filled with water.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:10%
When discovered in
the early 1900s.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.940 align:middle line:84%
As there have been no finds
of either bones or artifacts

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
from this level, it
has been suggested

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.400 align:middle line:84%
that these chambers here
may have been designed

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:90%
as storage for water or grain.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Water storage has
also been put forward

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
as the possible function
of the hypogeum at Knossos

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.500 align:middle line:84%
on Crete, dated between
2150 and 2000 BC.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:84%
The primary function of the
hypogeum site was certainly

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
as a cemetery, as around 7,000
skeletons have been found

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in the chambers, ranging in
date from 3600 to 2500 BC,

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
in other words, spanning
the life of the site itself.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.780 align:middle line:84%
This amount of human remains
is significantly higher

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:84%
than the tombs could have
housed at any one period,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.350 align:middle line:84%
indicating, along with the
dates of the skeletons,

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:31.330 align:middle line:84%
that the complex was used for
burials over several centuries.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.180 align:middle line:84%
The fact that no human
remains were discovered

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.540 align:middle line:84%
in some rooms such
as the Holy of Holies

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:84%
would suggest other functions
for these parts of the site.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they were used for
funerary rituals involving

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:84%
priests contacting
the ancestors.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
An interesting clue to one
of the original functions

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:84%
of the hypogeum
is the resemblance

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.230 align:middle line:90%
of the site to natural caves.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.580 align:middle line:84%
The near darkness of the
original subterranean chambers

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and passageways is
a little difficult

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to imagine nowadays
with the brightness

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of the artificial
lighting at the site.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:84%
But originally, whoever
was allowed to venture down

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:84%
into the depths of the
hypogeum would only

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
have had the dim light
of animal fat lamps

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:84%
to help them through the maze of
rooms, passageways, and niches.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps what took place
inside the hypogeum involved

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:84%
some kind of procession
or ritual initiation

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
through the disorienting
labyrinth structure, which

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.190 align:middle line:84%
included passing through
porthole entrances

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
into particularly
restricted shrines.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Such a mysterious subterranean
structure as the hypogeum

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is bound to generate its
own legends and folklore.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, there are a host of
legendary tales associated

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.970 align:middle line:84%
with the hypogeum, from
disappearing parties

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
of schoolchildren to
subterranean monsters

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.790 align:middle line:90%
and underground alien bases.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:10%
The majority of these stories
can be traced back to an article

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:10%
by Richard Walter in the August
1940 edition of the National

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:10%
Geographic Magazine entitled
"Wanderers Awheel in Malta."

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.140 align:middle line:84%
This war time piece discusses
the various underground

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:84%
passageways on Malta
being used as part

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:84%
of the fortifications and
defense system of the island.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.120 align:middle line:84%
It also states that
at one time, it

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.580 align:middle line:84%
was possible to traverse the
island using these tunnels,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:84%
but the government closed the
entrances to these tunnels

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.790 align:middle line:84%
after school children
and their teachers became

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:84%
lost in the labyrinth while on
a study tour and never returned.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, the
parents of the children

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.980 align:middle line:84%
claimed they could hear
cries of the children

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.490 align:middle line:84%
for weeks afterwards coming
from under the ground

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.020 align:middle line:84%
in several parts of the island,
as if some strange phenomena was

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.630 align:middle line:90%
beckoning others to their doom.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
In this single article from
the National Geographic

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.200 align:middle line:84%
lies the origin of a host
of contemporary folklore

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
about disappearances and secret
tunnels underneath the hypogeum,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.170 align:middle line:84%
which has been mostly
built up on the internet.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that the
original National Geographic

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.220 align:middle line:84%
article cites no
sources for the tale,

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and no contemporary
accounts of the tragedy

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.680 align:middle line:90%
have ever been discovered.

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The hypogeum is not mentioned
by name in the article,

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:84%
so we are not even sure if
the alleged incident even

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.460 align:middle line:90%
occurred there.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:84%
The story has the ring of
local folklore, perhaps a tale

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
concocted to keep children away
from the dangerous tunnels.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:84%
It also brings to mind the
mysterious disappearance

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Australian schoolgirls
in Joan Lindsay's novel,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.750 align:middle line:84%
"Picnic at Hanging Rock,"
1967, for many years,

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:84%
believed to be a true incident,
despite the protestations

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.710 align:middle line:90%
of the author of the novel.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:10%
Thanks to a number of stories
published first in the 1960s

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.490 align:middle line:10%
and copied on the internet
over the past decade

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.420 align:middle line:10%
or so, the folklore of the
alleged hypogeum disappearance

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:10%
has taken on a life of its own.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
According to these
stories, which conveniently

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
don't cite any
sources, 30 children

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
vanished with their
teachers while

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.199 align:middle line:90%
on a study tour of the hypogeum.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.230 align:middle line:84%
New elements with no
foundation in fact

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.219 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever were added to the
archeology of the hypogeum

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:84%
site itself to make the supposed
disappearance more lurid.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have 30,000 bodies
discovered by archeologists

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.989 align:middle line:90%
in the chambers, not 7,000.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And the remains were
all human sacrifices

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:90%
to some underworld god.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:84%
In the best traditions
of the modern folklore

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.230 align:middle line:84%
of underground
archeological sites,

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:39.350 align:middle line:84%
the tunnels underneath
the hypogeum

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
are said to stretch
for hundreds of miles

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.810 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
catacombs underneath Rome,

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.510 align:middle line:84%
improving on the original
National Geographic article.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.230 align:middle line:84%
We are told that a
British embassy worker,

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:84%
or in some accounts,
an American tourist

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.590 align:middle line:84%
called Ms. Lois Jessop
discovered a series of tunnels

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.390 align:middle line:84%
underneath the lower
level of the hypogeum.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And in an unexplored
cavern, she encountered

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.760 align:middle line:84%
several large, hairy
creatures with strange powers.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, she later learned
that this was the same cavern

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:84%
where the children and their
teachers had disappeared

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.380 align:middle line:84%
sometime in the 1940s,
after which the entrance

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
of the hypogeum was sealed
off and nobody was allowed

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:90%
to investigate the site.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.160 align:middle line:84%
From working at the
British embassy,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Ms. Lois Jessop
went on to become

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:84%
secretary of the New York Flying
Saucer Information Bureau.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.640 align:middle line:84%
The sources for these bizarre
stories include a 1960s printed

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:42.470 align:middle line:84%
lecture by one-time director
of Borderland Sciences Research

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, Riley Crabb called
"The Reality of the Cavern

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
World" and a chapter, "Malta,
Entrance to the Cavern World"

00:35:52.280 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
in a 1966 book entitled "Enigma
Fantastique" by W. Gordon Allen,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.680 align:middle line:84%
essentially a reprint
of the Crabb article.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.530 align:middle line:84%
There is one element of
these bizarre legends

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.750 align:middle line:84%
about the hypogeum that has
some truth to it, however.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The site was indeed closed for
a number of years between 1992

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and 1996, though not because
of any mysterious disappearance

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:20.160 align:middle line:90%
in its tunnels.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The reason was that
major conservation work

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.850 align:middle line:84%
was being carried out
due to the damage being

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:84%
done to the limestone
walls by years

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:84%
of visitors exhaling carbon
dioxide in the enclosed space.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.650 align:middle line:84%
To protect against
this damage, numbers

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:84%
are now restricted to 80
prebooked visitors per day,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and a microclimate
has been installed

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.680 align:middle line:84%
above the underground chambers
to regulate air temperature

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:90%
and humidity.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:84%
In 1980, the fascinating
Hal-Saflieni hypogeum

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:84%
was added to UNESCO's
World Heritage list.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Strangely enough, when
now visiting the hypogeum,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:84%
visitors are not permitted
to photograph, film,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.600 align:middle line:84%
or even take audible recordings
while security guards watch

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
over a controlled small
group of 20 visitors.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Many researchers
ponder, why is that?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And is there something that is
being kept away from the public?

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.000 align:middle line:90%
