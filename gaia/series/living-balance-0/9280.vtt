00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,
and I want to welcome you

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.600 align:middle line:10%
to "Living In Balance."

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600 align:middle line:10%
Our program today is called
The Enlightened Dowser.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking about
dowsing, that ancient blend

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of art and science.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
be looking at it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:90%
from a spiritual perspective.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.443 align:middle line:90%
So come join us.

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:21.415 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I took the liberty of calling
Joey Korn the Enlightened

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Dancer.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:84%
He said he's aspiring to
that, but he's not real sure

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.090 align:middle line:90%
that he can claim that yet.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.260 align:middle line:90%
But I'd like to welcome you.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, thank you.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You have written
a book about it.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.095 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
a book that you

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:90%
have revised maybe nine times.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's called "Dowsing--

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
A Path to Enlightenment."

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And you said that
it has really helped

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
you move along your own
personal spiritual path.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw-- I learned
to dance when I--

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:90%
well, in 1986.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately saw
it as a spiritual tool.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:90%
And it has taken me--

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.390 align:middle line:84%
it's made me ever more
soundly on my path,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
helped me step ever more soundly
on my path to enlightenment.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, not everyone
knows what dowsing.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.918 align:middle line:10%
Now, vaguely they'll say, well,
isn't that how you find water?

00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:10%
>> That's how it started.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, but--

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:10%
>> With a forked stick
from a tree, a branch.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, there are
many different kinds

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:90%
of dowsing tools.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But basically, dowsing
is a process to tune

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
into the subtle energies that
are everywhere around us.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And it can help us realize that
we are electrical beings living

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.820 align:middle line:84%
in an electrical
universe, or beings

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
of light living
in a sea of light.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's as if it's
back in again to dowse.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And people do it to answer
questions in their life

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and also to find what
might be negative energies

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:90%
or positive energies.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:10%
So for a while,
though, only water

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:10%
was what it was used
for, to find the water.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how it
started, finding water.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But once you realize
that you're not

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
finding the physical water,
the substance of the water,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
you're finding the
energy of the water,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
then you can take
the leap and realize

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
that you can tune into
anything that you can think of.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.465 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, your mind knows the
energy frequency of the things

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that-- of just about
anything you're looking for.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And you hold that
intent in your mind,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
dowsing reactions

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.443 align:middle line:90%
to whatever you're looking for.

00:02:26.443 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And you think of the dowsing
rods as being an extension

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
of who you are, of you.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're just more open
to or responsive to energies?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> They help you tune in to
everything-- it's like a radio,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:90%
tuning a radio.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And you tune into
certain frequencies

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:90%
that you hold in your intent.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
think that the rods are

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:84%
the dowser or the
pendulum are the dowsing--

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:90%
are the dowsers.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:90%
But you are the dowser.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The energies around
us and around you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.500 align:middle line:84%
affect you every single
moment of your life,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
and the energies within you.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And dowsing can help you
tune into those energies

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:90%
and find them.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.967 align:middle line:84%
>> And you actually have put the
energies in three categories--

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Three broad categories.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.592 align:middle line:84%
>> --is how you like
to look at them.

00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Very broad, OK.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And the energies are
beneficial and clear

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:90%
is how you look at them.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.152 align:middle line:90%
>> And those are--

00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in all of our
environment, we would

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:90%
find some beneficial energy.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
If you have a fairly
happy, healthy life,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
your environment
and your being will

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:90%
be full of beneficial energies.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there's
also detrimental.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> These are energies
that weaken you.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
The beneficial energies
strengthen you.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.482 align:middle line:84%
I call it clear
because I believe

00:03:37.482 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
these energies are like
conductors of the life force.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And clear lets the light
pass through freely.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Detrimental would
be-- they weaken you.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.235 align:middle line:84%
And many dowsers believe
over long periods of time

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
they can make you sick,
detrimental energies.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And most dowsers
think that they're

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
natural forces of the Earth,
like underground streams.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The energy of an
underground stream

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
can carry a detrimental
energy to it that weakens you.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And you believe then
that blocks the energy.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:90%
So you call that then opaque.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like the
energy can't get through.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, the third type of
energy is basically neutral.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Neutral, right.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So a little cloudy.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- these energies,
they don't affect us one way

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:90%
or another.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
What makes my work different
from most dowsers who even work

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
with these energies
is that I realize

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that we affect these energies
as much as they affect us.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I believe
that each of us

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
creates our own unique
energy environment

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
in our homes and our
offices and our living

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
spaces with our thoughts,
our emotions, our actions,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:90%
our fears, our anxieties.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And the energies-- the subtle
energies, which are invisible

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:84%
beams of light and
waves of light,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
these energies are a reflection
of your health and well-being

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:90%
or lack thereof.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how do you
relate that to our aura,

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to what is talked about is our
own personal energy field that

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:84%
is a certain distance out from
us and that people can read

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and that some people see and
that has also light and dark

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:90%
spots and so forth?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You can dowse the aura.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I like to more
dowse the auric field.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you dowse
for the energy

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
field or the auric field, and
you do enough of the dowsing,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that
it make-- you are

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.610 align:middle line:84%
a vortex, that your energy
spirals out from you

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.112 align:middle line:84%
and then back to
you all the time.

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
You're a living vortex,
and that can be--

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm always sending out
energy and it's always coming

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
back to me, and we're
always exchanging energy.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You and I, for
example, are now.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.633 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, we're
exchanging energy,

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:32.283 align:middle line:84%
not just thoughts and ideas
and words, but energy.

00:05:32.283 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're in my
space and I'm in your space.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just like that.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%
You have the dowsing rods.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds
of different ones.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to show us those?

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> These are some
of your favorites.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> These are.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> And you gave me--

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I like them.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.358 align:middle line:10%
These are called L rods,
mainly because they're

00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:48.280 align:middle line:10%
shaped like an L. And
these have the added effect

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:10%
of having antennas
attached to them.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds you that you're
tuning into frequencies,

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:90%
to energy frequencies.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
dowsing reaction.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what I use the
most, pointing to--

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
opening to point in
opposite directions.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:84%
This would be like
a search position.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And this would be
another dowsing reaction.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And some people use real rods
for yes and no questions.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.735 align:middle line:84%
But most people use
the pendulum for that.

00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>> For the dowsing.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, if we look
at these closely,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:10%
the way that you
do not control them

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:10%
is because they slip into this.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:10%
And so if we take
a look at that,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.370 align:middle line:10%
it's like you're not moving
it because you're holding down

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:10%
So it's actually on free play.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:10%
But I-- dowsers in recent
years have realized

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:10%
that there are actually
minuscule movements

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:10%
within your body that
causes the dowsing reaction.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:10%
So to a certain
extent, what you're

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.840 align:middle line:10%
doing with dowsing is
you're training your body

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:10%
to get these--

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:10%
some dowsers would
take exception to this,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.130 align:middle line:10%
but you're training your body to
make these minuscule movements

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:10%
as a result of the energies that
are around you and the energies

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:10%
that you're looking for.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's OK that you're
contributing to the movement.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
a problem with that.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.052 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't have a
problem with that at all.

00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing--
your body is--

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:90%
again, you're the dowser.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:10%
This simply accentuates what's
going on within your body,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:10%
within your energy.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:10%
And then you can feel it.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:10%
There's no doubt-- once
you do a little dowsing,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:10%
there's no doubt that
this is something

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:10%
that's really happening.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, I asked you to dowse
the set because I felt that,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.780 align:middle line:10%
because we spend so much time
here and so many positive

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.113 align:middle line:10%
things are said and so many
wonderful people sit in that

00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:37.913 align:middle line:10%
chair--

00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:10%
And that chair.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:10%
>> One wonderful person.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:10%
>> And so with that, there
should be energy here that you

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:10%
could feel--

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.013 align:middle line:10%
>> --that you could dowse.

00:07:48.013 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:10%
And what would you--

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:10%
if you were to do
that, what would we

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.576 align:middle line:10%
find out about that energy?

00:07:53.576 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, what I've already found
is that there are several what

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:10%
I call beams of light, invisible
beams of light suspended

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:10%
in time and space.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:10%
And there are several that
intersect where this chair is,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:10%
where somebody would--
where you sit--

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:10%
and then where I--
where your guest sits--

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:10%
your guests sit.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:10%
And these beams of light,
where they intersect--

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:10%
they're suspended
in time and space,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and where they
intersect, they create

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:10%
a little vortex, what you
might call a mini power spot.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So a little power
spot is created.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:10%
But also, because we have all
of the technical things out here

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:10%
as far as our cameras and all
of the different machinery

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:37.259 align:middle line:10%
and things, we are in a very
powerful electromagnetic field.

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Electromagnetic, right.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.159 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, you feel that those can
be negative and we can switch

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:10%
those to positive.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's call them
weakening or detrimental.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But also, there
are bands of them.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people look
at EMF, and they only

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:10%
think of EMF, the
electromagnetic fields coming

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:10%
from wires and equipment and
appliances, microwave ovens,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:10%
televisions, computer
screens, as being

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:10%
detrimental or bad for you.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I find-- and this is again
what makes my work different--

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I find that we can simply
change these energies,

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:90%
transmute them to be beneficial.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:84%
I think all these energies, the
energies of underground streams

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and other natural forces of the
Earth, the energies of EMF that

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:84%
come from appliances, these
beams of light suspended

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
in time and space,
they can either

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
carry an energy
that's detrimental

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.860 align:middle line:90%
to us, neutral to us, or--

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Beneficial.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>> --beneficial to us.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
If you find energies that
are detrimental to us, that

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
weaken us, a simple,
properly stated,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
sincere prayer will change it
immediately to be beneficial--

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's the--

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> --even EMF

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> --enlightened dowser.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
That's that aspect there,
because what you're saying

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:90%
is we can change that.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:90%
And it is the power of prayer--

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Power of prayer.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --that can do that.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.135 align:middle line:90%
And it is just that simple.

00:09:49.135 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Just that easy.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
A lot of dowsers who
work with these energies

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.498 align:middle line:84%
do various things when they
find detrimental energies,

00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:57.040 align:middle line:84%
like an underground
stream that might

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
course deep under the ground
but right under your bed.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:84%
A lot of dowsers think
that that's not good.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.397 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do things
like hammering rods

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.105 align:middle line:84%
into the ground called
Earth acupuncture.

00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I love that,
Earth acupuncture.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And it actually will block
the energies or bounce them

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.405 align:middle line:84%
And you can find all
that with dowsing.

00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:17.655 align:middle line:84%
Well, I find that we want
these energies in our living

00:10:17.655 --> 00:10:18.455 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:10:18.455 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
We just want them
to be beneficial.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:90%
And again, a prayer will do it.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So the prayer--

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> But properly stated.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> --properly stated, has
intention of changing what

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.990 align:middle line:84%
would be detrimental
to beneficial.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:90%
And you can do that.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not just--
what I've found with my--

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
first of all, I consider
dowsing a sacred process.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And I consider dowsing
tools to be sacred tools.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
not only change things

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
from detrimental to
beneficial, but you

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
can bring in new
beneficial energies

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
and create a unique
energy configuration

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to bring whatever you really
are wanting to bring in,

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
what you desire and what you
want to bring into your life.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
You can call that
in with prayer.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And I find it with
sincere prayer,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
energies change within
you and around you,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can see
that with dowsing.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:90%
You can experience it.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we're going to go into
a whole other concept of how

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:10%
you've developed this, and it's
called two lights of the soul.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating information.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:10%
But I think we should
take a break first.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:10%
And when we do, we'll
come back, and we'll

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:10%
be talking more about dowsing
and also more about Joey.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:10%
I think people should get to
know you as an author too.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you will stay
tuned, we will be back

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.536 align:middle line:90%
with the enlightened dowser.

00:11:31.536 --> 00:11:33.488 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:33.488 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:10%
And if you are just joining
us, I am Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.090 align:middle line:10%
and I am interviewing
the enlightened dowser.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Joey Korn, welcome again.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have authored the
book, Again "Dowsing--

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.450 align:middle line:90%
A Path to Enlightenment."

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, you
keep revising it.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:10%
But you also are
well-known for another book

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:10%
that you have written, and
that is called "Abe's Story."

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's a Holocaust
memoir that you

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.910 align:middle line:10%
rewrote your father's story.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:90%
My dad died when I was 19.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:90%
He spent his entire--

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
well, the entire World War II,
from the beginning of the War

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
till the end, in Nazi prisons,
ghettos, and concentration

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:90%
camps.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:10%
And he wrote-- he began writing
his memoirs 25 years later.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:10%
He died when I was
19, and he left

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:10%
a rough draft, which
I finally turned

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:10%
into a publishable manuscript.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was originally
published in 1995.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's a real work of love.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:10%
>> And it's just such an
inspiring, wonderful story.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And you said that your path
has taken you on this journey.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
You've included dowsing
now, but you've always

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.185 align:middle line:84%
been a spiritual person
on a spiritual path

00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and aware of that
for many years.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Basically, since I was 21.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 46.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:90%
47.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> So as a grownup.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:90%
As almost a grownup.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> All my adult life, right.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the things that
we had promised we'd talk about

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:90%
were the two lights of the soul.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And you said that
you create a vortex.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Each person has power
center because we

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:84%
have these two lights that
are crossing in our being.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you've found?

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What I started finding--

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm always asking why?

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I started
finding intersections

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
of two invisible lights at
places like chairs and desks,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and many intersecting
lights around beds,

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:90%
and in a very unique pattern.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering-- in
front of refrigerators.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.425 align:middle line:90%
In front of the stove.

00:13:33.425 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%
In front of the sink.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Places that-- high-use areas.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Places that you use.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:90%
And I wondered, why is that?

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Why do these energies come
to these high-use areas?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you came over
to our home yesterday.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:10%
And where my husband sits,
on the sofa where I would be,

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.092 align:middle line:10%
for example, that's
where you found these--

00:13:49.092 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Intersecting lights.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.510 align:middle line:10%
>> --intersecting lights,
which create this power vortex,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:10%
this power center, because
that's where people spend

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:10%
their time and their energy.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So the vortexes are created,
or vortices as they call them.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But what I've realized
is that we each have

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
two beams of light, invisible
light, that intersect us

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:90%
wherever we go.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
They go with us.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And these two beams of
light I call the two lights

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
of the soul.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they anchor
the soul to the body

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and that they are how we relate
to everything else, everyone

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:84%
else, and especially
the energies around us.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, from biblical times, we
have some beautiful paintings.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And Christ is always shown
with the intersecting lights.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's say often.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Often.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In a lot of the
Catholic icons.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
What I realized-- I'd been
teaching in my workshops

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and lectures about
the two lights

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
of the soul for about
a year that each of us

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:90%
has in our lives.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized,
one day I just

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:90%
noticed it on a Catholic icon.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the two lights of
the soul, the cross that's

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:90%
at Jesus's head.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.877 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it must
be the two lights,

00:14:57.877 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
it must be symbolic of the two
lights, not the physical cross.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Conductors of the life force.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, when
I looked into it,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
in Catholicism that's
called the nimbus.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And it does not represent
the physical cross.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It represents what's
called the light of God.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And the little halo
effect around his head

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%
is called the crown of light.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:10%
And so it was obvious to me
that it was representing--

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.177 align:middle line:10%
at least the two
lights at his head

00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:10%
are representing
light, not the cross.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, we had the
picture of Moses and Elijah,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and they too had that,
the intersecting--

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.730 align:middle line:10%
These come from
stained glass windows

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:10%
at the Sacred Heart, what
used to be a church, now

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.860 align:middle line:10%
a cultural center in Augusta.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And that that one
with Moses and Elijah

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
is from a famous painting
called "The Transfiguration."

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it shows Moses
with literally two

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
beams of light
intersecting at his head.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.347 align:middle line:84%
>> And with man, you feel
that we also have those too,

00:15:56.347 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that there is the
intersecting light--

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>> With human being--

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --with human beings.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, with all of us.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, Moses's and
Jesus's are always

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.920 align:middle line:84%
intersecting at the
third eye, representing

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:90%
cosmic consciousness.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And I find that we
typically represent--

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
they're intersecting us
typically from the lower

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:90%
abdomen to the neck.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you did
me, for example,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:90%
it was at the heart center.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> At your heart.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Just about there.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:19.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Your heart center.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:90%
Unconditional love.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Now these-- that's it.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:10%
These patterns
also-- and we're only

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:10%
going to touch upon this
because this is something

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.910 align:middle line:10%
that, in your study
of the Kabbalah,

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:10%
which is Jewish mysticism,
you have found that there are

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.260 align:middle line:10%
patterns of light that
are created that are not

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:10%
unlike the patterns of light
the Kabbalah or the tree of life

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:10%
also depict.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I'm
finding is that my work--

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jewish.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone my whole
adult life seemingly

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
studying other traditions.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And I find that it all comes
right back to my Jewish roots

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and that what I'm
working with now--

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.050 align:middle line:84%
what I do is I help
people understand

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
their unlimited potential as
spiritual beings of light.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Kabbalah
is all about light.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm what I'm
learning-- and Kabbalah

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.849 align:middle line:84%
is at the core of Jewish
mysticism, in case people

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:84%
haven't heard of what the
Kabbalah is and its teachings.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed to
be the spiritual Torah,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual Old Testament
that was handed down orally.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:10%
And my word just
fits beautifully

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.230 align:middle line:10%
in with Kabbalistic teachings.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that fascinating, when
you've looked at everything

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:90%
and then you've come back?

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And I feel like I've--

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I've made
discoveries that really

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:90%
tie directly to Kabbalah.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, you use the pendulum,
and the pendulum you said also

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:10%
dowses for energies.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we dowse.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:10%
This is just a different
tool for tuning

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:10%
into the same energies
in different ways.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to show us yours?

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:10%
>> And the concept here of the
pendulum as a dowsing tool.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, some people use the
pendulum for yes or no answers.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And they might-- this
might represent a yes,

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:90%
and this might represent a no.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
consider that the pendulum

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:90%
is giving them the answers.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's your own
being that does that.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:10%
So we're not consciously
controlling it,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:10%
but what you think we
are controlling in--

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, in a way.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.260 align:middle line:10%
What you're doing is tuning in
more to your intuitive side,

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.960 align:middle line:10%
tuning in more to your
higher self, hopefully.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:10%
And so that's where
your intent should be.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
But I use a pendulum
in a different way.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
I use a pendulum
in my prayer work.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I find
that when we pray,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:90%
energies change around us.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So I use that
consciously in my prayer.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I call for energies to change
within me and around me

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
or within others and
around them to bring

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:90%
whatever I want into my life.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>> So it is a healing tool.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And this is all--

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>> --that your work
comes to, then,

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
is that you recognize
those energies,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and you can use it for
healing with using prayer.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's the prayer that
brings the healing, I think,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and the intent.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And I just use this, the
pendulum, as a signal.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:90%
It keeps me on task.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
It helps me tune
into the energies.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And I use it as a signal
that tells me, OK,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:84%
the work that you've called
for is complete for now.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you said that
you with bless our--

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:84%
you would say a prayer for
this set, for the show--

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --and so forth.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that you
do, like you did in our home

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And you would do
that for us now?

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
What I do, all my prayers begin
the same and they end the same.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.775 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle,
I stick my intent

00:19:30.775 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of what I want to
bring into my life.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of transforms
personal prayer

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
from a pleading to a
beckoning for energies

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to come in to be
conducive to what

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you want to bring into your
life, is the way I do it.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.480 align:middle line:10%
So I would start--

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm actually swinging this.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Intentionally,
and you know it.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:10%
>> But when it goes to
the left and to the right,

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.502 align:middle line:10%
that's a tendency that
I'm not controlling.

00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:10%
And I just start with,
if it be thy will,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:10%
may the powers of
nature converge

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:10%
to charge this area
with the life force,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.170 align:middle line:10%
to create a unique
energy configuration,

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:10%
to bring healing and balance
to all who come here,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.390 align:middle line:10%
and to help Georgia
in her efforts,

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:10%
and to draw to her the right
guests at the right time

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:10%
to help the viewing
audience draw ever closer

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:10%
to their highest potential
as spiritual beings,

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.675 align:middle line:10%
ever closer to
the universal one,

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:10%
and to bring healing and
balance into their lives for now

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:10%
and into the future, for
as long as is appropriate.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.620 align:middle line:90%
To me, the work is already done.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:10%
That was my signal.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:10%
When it returned to what
I call my search position

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:10%
and stayed there, that
told me that the work that

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:10%
I was calling for, the energy
changes that I was calling for,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.220 align:middle line:10%
were already complete before
I even finished the prayer.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:10%
It's the intent that matters.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And it takes your--

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:10%
with words, it takes a
little longer sometimes.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:10%
So when it stayed in
my search position,

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:10%
that's my signal
that we're done.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:10%
And the energy really
did change just then.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have blessed us
and set an intention for all

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.693 align:middle line:84%
of our future shows to serve our
audience well, and all of is.

00:20:59.693 --> 00:21:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And to draw the
right people to you--

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> --that might
want to interview,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and to also bless
your audience as well.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:10%
I think that's wonderful.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:10%
I think you are serving the
planet well as a dowser.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.210 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very interesting
approach that you have taken.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.630 align:middle line:10%
And as you said,
this is your gift now

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:10%
that you feel that you're
going to be sharing.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's a gift
that was given to me.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I've made many
discoveries in my work

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:90%
as a dowser that are going on.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But I just feel like it's
discoveries about life that

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.720 align:middle line:84%
goes on behind
the scenes in life

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.010 align:middle line:84%
all the time, whether
we know it or not.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And dowsing can help
us tune into that.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:10%
And when we realize that
these energies are around us

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:10%
and we're changing them
all the time, including

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:10%
bringing in
detrimentals, then we

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:10%
can take control of
that process and make

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:10%
energies beneficial to us.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Wonderful.

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Joey.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you would like to be
in touch with Joey and perhaps

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:84%
get one of his books-- and also
we always love to hear from

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:90%
And then some parting thoughts.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:57.604 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I love to bring different
techniques and ideas to you

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.330 align:middle line:84%
so that you can look at what
might work for you, what

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:84%
could make a difference in your
life, another step on your path

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.810 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.660 align:middle line:90%
And it might be dowsing.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So to live in balance in mind,
body, and spirit, perhaps

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
dowsing could assist you.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:84%
May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
