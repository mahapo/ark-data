00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA SHAKTI-HILL: Hello,
I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And we do have a
wonderful guest today.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.160 align:middle line:90%
We have Elizabeth Joyce.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.260 align:middle line:84%
She is a woman who is
known to have been born

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.940 align:middle line:90%
with the gift of knowledge.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:84%
She has used that
gift of knowledge

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
to help so many different
people in so many ways.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're excited to share
this information with you.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.360 align:middle line:90%
So do come join us.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:36.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.472 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Joyce is a renowned
medium psychic intuitive.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of different
words for the gifts

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.323 align:middle line:90%
that she shares.

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things
that she shares

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:90%
also are in the form of tapes.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have a couple of
those to share with you today

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:84%
about healing depression
and also about the chakras.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But the work that
she has done she

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
started with, as she explained
it, the gift of knowledge.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we are so pleased to have
with us today Elizabeth Joyce.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what is the
gift of knowledge?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.628 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH JOYCE: Well,
the gift of knowledge is one

00:01:06.628 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
of the seven gifts that Christ
left his disciples and said

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.880 align:middle line:84%
would continue through
mankind until he returned--

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the gift of knowledge, the gift
of healing, the gift of wisdom.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I would
like to say that I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
have been born with
the ability to have

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:84%
some telepathic
response with people

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and to see visions of
things either in the past

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:90%
or in the future.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's been so natural to
me that I've never really

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
had to use a crystal
ball or a Tarot card.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.947 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that's a part of my body.

00:01:38.947 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And you have used it
in so many different ways that

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
you have been really recognized
and honored for years--

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Women's Day Magazine.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: That's correct.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: ABC named you
one of the top 20 psychics

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:90%
or mediums in the United States.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I was named in
1998 because they asked in '97

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:90%
for me to make the prediction.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said a dark
haired girl named

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Veronica would upset
the White House,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
an angry blonde would
bring forth the truth.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it would later be
verified and Clinton

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:84%
would be impeached in
the four months of '98.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.925 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: So there you go.

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: They
shouldn't ask if they

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.918 align:middle line:90%
don't want the answer, right?

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: They did
ask, didn't they?

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.335 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Correct.

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And this
information then came to you?

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: You can
explain that to people

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:90%
as to what medium it is.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:90%
You said you're clairvoyant.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:90%
You're a clairaudience.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:90%
You're a clair--

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.015 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Clairsentience.

00:02:27.015 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Clairsentience.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: There's
three types of ways

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that we can use our telepathic
responses, which I believe

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
in the next Millennium, we're
going to develop ourselves

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
in mankind by becoming more
telepathic and more empathetic.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think it will be one
of the steps towards world

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
peace between that
and the internet

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and getting to know people in
other lands and accepting them.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So clairaudience
is clear hearing.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Clairsentience is a feeling
when your hair stands on end

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and you know something's
going on, or a hunch.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And then clear
seeing, clairvoyance,

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is clear seeing
from the third eye.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And I literally see movies,
sometimes in black and white

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.908 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes in color.

00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now all of
us have this ability.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.867 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: That's correct.

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: But you have
one that was developed.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
You came-- you were
born with it basically.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And you have always had it.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So for you, it is as natural
to you as all the other senses

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:90%
that you have?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.472 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: That's true.

00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was focused on when
I was hit by a drunk driver

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:90%
with my son in 1979.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they did that
show on "Unsolved Mysteries"

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.180 align:middle line:90%
recently.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had the out-of-body
near-death experience.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I came
back from that, I

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
had a recurring dream,
which was in the woman's day

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
story of this body
blowing up from a house

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:90%
and going back into tumbleweeds.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what it was about.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And I kept hearing
your aunt died.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:90%
She's in Houston, Texas.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, my family is
from New England.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a very
close friend of mine,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:90%
who is a social worker.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.853 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I thought
I was going crazy,

00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:84%
that I thought there had been
some neurological damage I

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:90%
kept having this dream.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And she turned white
and said, my goodness.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I see ivy going
up the side of the house.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's oil wells and
a fence and a trailer park.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And she said describe it to me.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
I said I can draw it for you.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Well her aunt was missing from
the Houston well explosions.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:90%
And her name was Ivy.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And they found the
body within one hour.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well, this must
have been very difficult

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
for you then to have this kind
of a dream that reoccurred.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
And also, it was--

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.595 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was such a painful
story that you were sharing.

00:04:30.595 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, it was--

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:90%
to me, it was bizarre.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't particularly
painful to me.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: It wasn't your--

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I
didn't understand it.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
When the Exxon-- when the
man president from Exxon

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
disappeared and I turned on
the television set on April 28

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
in '92, and I saw the
newscast, immediately I

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:90%
saw a blue Cadillac.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:90%
I saw the license plate number.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.690 align:middle line:90%
I saw how he had been abducted.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I knew the door was ajar and
the motor was still running.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I knew all about
what had happened

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
in that murder for
the Exxon president.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that I
knew was because my father

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:90%
worked for Exxon for 49 years.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.200 align:middle line:90%
So I had a connection.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I had what I call a
timeline connection.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.637 align:middle line:84%
And people think
if you're psychic,

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
or if you're clairvoyant, that
you can look at them right away

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
and tell them something.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if you
follow natural law,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:84%
you can't do anything that's a
psychic impression unless you

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
have permission from
the other person.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.832 align:middle line:84%
So if a girl calls me
up about her boyfriend,

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're having a fight,
and you have that all the time,

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and she wants me to tell
her what he's doing,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.942 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do that.

00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And that's
not your role to do that?

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: No,
that's not my role.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So you
have to have some kind

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.328 align:middle line:84%
of a personal connection
or be given permission.

00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: The
permission-- the only time

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that you can do that is
if it's an elderly parent,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:84%
or if it's a child,
and the parents are

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.963 align:middle line:90%
asking for guidance.

00:05:52.963 --> 00:05:55.213 align:middle line:84%
And then you can help them
and guide them in that way.

00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now, you
use the terminology

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.685 align:middle line:84%
that you are overshadowed
with spiritual power.

00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Correct.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: What does
that mean to you?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: What it means
to me is that there's

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
a responsibility that you
carry with this wonderful gift

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that I have, which is
invaluable to myself, but really

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.020 align:middle line:90%
can be helpful to others.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And if I used it and
abused it in any way,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that it could be
taken like that.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So you're overshadowed
with an energy

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
that comes at your request.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think that the
energy is always there.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And we as human
beings haven't learned

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.238 align:middle line:84%
how to be connected
to it all the time.

00:06:30.238 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
You know when you wake up in
the morning and you have a hunch

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and you know something
wonderful is going to happen,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:84%
or you wake up in the
morning and you're sad,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're going to
hear some sad news that way,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:90%
that's a hunch.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the chakra's
working for you.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
That's your energy
field connecting

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to something on your timeline
either with family or friends

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.475 align:middle line:84%
or an experience that's
giving you a pre signal.

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now, the
tape that you have,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:84%
"The Chakras in
Your Body," you said

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.387 align:middle line:84%
that you would use
this for 120 days

00:06:55.387 --> 00:06:56.720 align:middle line:90%
and you would see great changes?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Absolutely.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and that
would be where you would

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:90%
be getting more self awareness.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
You would be--

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.278 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: You would
get more self awareness.

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that helps
to clear the heart from pain

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:90%
of relationships.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I also feel that
it helps to open

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:90%
something called the third eye.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.193 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And the third eye
is that spiritual awakening?

00:07:14.193 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, it's when
two eyes come together as one

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you will see
as is said in the Bible.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And it really is
the ability to have

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to be able to close
your eyes and see

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.258 align:middle line:84%
a picture either of the past,
as I said, or of the future.

00:07:27.258 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: As you said, you do.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see it almost as if it's
in color or black and white.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:90%
You see it as if it's a movie.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.817 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Right, but one
of the most fascinating things

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:37.585 align:middle line:84%
to me is that as we are
sitting here talking, Shakti,

00:07:37.585 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
and as we are
going through life,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
every single day, every
decision that we make

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:90%
creates our future life.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you believe
in reincarnation,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and you came from certain
patterns and abilities

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that you either used
or abused and you

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
have to correct
in this lifetime,

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:84%
then the way that
we handle people,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
the way we handle others
creates our future life.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you know
that, it may help

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:90%
you open to the power of love.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now you
go back to 1979

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
when you had the
automobile accident.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.717 align:middle line:84%
OK, before that, were
you somewhat clairvoyant?

00:08:09.717 --> 00:08:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Were you sometimes--

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: I was
very clairvoyant.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And my friends would
all tell me that I was.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know it.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They would say you would
tell me that so and so was

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:90%
going to call.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And he would call.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Or they would call
me up and tell me

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
about their relationships
and ask me questions.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And I would answer them.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:90%
And then it would happen.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
When I was 10 years
old, I was walking home

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:90%
with a girlfriend from school.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And she asked me about
the lady upstairs.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said the lady
upstairs had died.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And her mother called
my mother that night.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And I got in trouble because
the lady upstairs had not died.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.060 align:middle line:90%
But she died three days later.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was and in
the reality of it

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
had already happened
and didn't realize it.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.527 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So there is
a time aspect to this?

00:08:51.527 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:90%
A time frame aspect.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes, when I was
very young, I was 5 years old.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I had to go live with
my grandmother in New

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Hampshire away from my family.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's when she said, you're
different from your sisters.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I am one of two
sets of identical twins.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: That is fascinating.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: And she
said you're different.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.295 align:middle line:90%
And she told me two things.

00:09:08.295 --> 00:09:09.830 align:middle line:84%
She told me that
I was clairvoyant.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
She told me it had been
in my family before

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and that some day I would
go to Egypt and some day

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that I would be helpful to
doing something for mankind.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And Indeed, I have done that.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going again.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: So the fact
that you-- and you--

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that you're
very aware then

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
of what the studies that
have been done on twins.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And you said that there are
two different types of twins

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.463 align:middle line:84%
and different
purposes within that.

00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Correct, there's
the twins that come together

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and they adore each other.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And they establish
their own language.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:90%
And my older sisters did that.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And my older sisters have
their own language now.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And they're in their 60s.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the twins
that are born to separate.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And I call it de-twinning.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They have to find their
own individual self.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.440 align:middle line:84%
They're born into a
partnership that's not chosen.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.210 align:middle line:90%
It's chosen by God.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So they have to work
through that partnership,

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
but also get to a place
where they take their self.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
They become their strength
and use their talents

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.660 align:middle line:84%
without relying
on the other one.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And it usually happens
between 36 and 50.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.783 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, so your purpose
with your twin was to de-twin--

00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Separate.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, to establish your
own self and your own identity.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: And as I
had done regressions

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
about my past lives,
two very vivid ones,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I was identical twin, again.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:90%
But she had died.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And I had gone on, which
was very interesting.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Yes.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Very
interesting therapy.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, now
in this lifetime

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
then, how are you using your
talents most effectively

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:90%
in helping other people?

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, I am
developing healing skills.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And I am teaching healing.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I did study with Louise
Hay and Dr. Deepak Chopra.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I have worked through their
modalities to perfect my own.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And I have developed something
called loving responses.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The two things that
I'm very good at

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
is locating something, whether
it's a person or an item,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.142 align:middle line:84%
and helping people with
mental, emotional responses.

00:11:03.142 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Well, I
think we want to spend

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.267 align:middle line:84%
a little time with that because
you have in developing it.

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to take a break.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.117 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, we're going

00:11:10.117 --> 00:11:12.425 align:middle line:84%
to talk about loving responses,
and also flow therapy

00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
because that's what you
call some of the work

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing
with people, too.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll stay
tuned, we're going

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to be coming back in
just a few minutes

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
with more information about the
gift of knowledge and Elizabeth

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Joyce.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
We're talking with
Elizabeth Joyce.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And in biblical terminology,
she has the gift of knowledge.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:90%
She is intuitive.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.940 align:middle line:90%
She is psychic.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And she has all of the three
clairvoyance, clairaudience,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.980 align:middle line:90%
and clairsentience.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot to say, isn't it?

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Which means that you
just kind of know stuff.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yeah.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.578 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, you do.

00:11:57.578 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:84%
You have insights of the
past and also the future

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and the present.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:84%
But you said that
you've put that together

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:90%
in your own healing modality.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.172 align:middle line:84%
You have called this
loving responses is

00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:90%
one thing that you work with.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: That works
with the mental, emotional.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
How you can handle a
relationship without getting

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:90%
everybody upset.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
is loving responses,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:90%
which works with the heartbeat.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's balancing the body at
the different pressure points.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It's using acupressure and
the tips of your fingers

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
on different parts of the
body on the opposite sides.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are several
flows that one can use.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.285 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this science is out
of Tibet and out of Japan.

00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:38.785 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: This is
the flow therapy.

00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: The flow therapy.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's healing.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So you bring in the
healing energies.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And you work with the heartbeat.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite impressive.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And it helps with
chronic illnesses,

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
like lower back
pain, a toothache.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:90%
It can help with--

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
if you have poor circulation,
and you're always cold,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:84%
it can help with chronic
fatigue syndrome.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.825 align:middle line:90%
It's good work.

00:13:00.825 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: It
sounds fascinating.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And you said that on the
mental, emotional level,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
though, that work that you
do is loving responses.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, and I like
that because you said,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we need
to practice that.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH:
Absolutely, and the way

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that you do it is
staying in the I am.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying you are
hurting me, you would say,

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I am feeling hurt
by what you said,

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.830 align:middle line:90%
and that is non-accusatory.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So it takes off the
need to fight back.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And so
in a situation--

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:84%
give us a situation of
how one might respond

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and how one could do that
in a loving response.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, if
you are having someone

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
be abusive to you whether it's
a parent, a boss, a husband,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:90%
or a wife, or whatever.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And somebody either
uses profanity

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:90%
or says something hurtful.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You could say back, are you
aware of what that sounds like?

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm uncomfortable
with what you said.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.320 align:middle line:90%
It was hurtful.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.052 align:middle line:90%
It was intended to be hurtful.

00:13:57.052 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Another example is if
you go to the post-office

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.030 align:middle line:90%
to buy some stamps.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And the person
behind the counter

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.330 align:middle line:90%
throws the stamps at you.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know that they're
upset about something.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
You could say I'm really sorry
that you're having a bad day.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting
angry at what they did,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
try to understand
that they are not you.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They are something separate.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.935 align:middle line:84%
And they're going through
something separate from you.

00:14:16.935 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a hard time
understanding, especially

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.460 align:middle line:84%
in this country, that
other people are separate

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and that what we perceive
isn't always the whole truth.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And their
behavior may have nothing

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.140 align:middle line:90%
to do with us whatsoever.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: And you take it so.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: We take it
so very personally.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Correct.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Exactly.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.528 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: The
other thing I like

00:14:33.528 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:84%
is what I call a
divine cosmic setup.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Now a divine cosmic
setup works like this.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I was going on a trip.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I got held up at the airport.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I talked with a woman
and her two kids.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.475 align:middle line:84%
They invited us for
dinner where I was going

00:14:47.475 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:90%
to, Asheville, North Carolina.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was very nice.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
But four days later, I
met some other friends.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And this one woman
was very depressed

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
because she couldn't
find housing

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.943 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have a good
realtor in that area.

00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And I told her to call this
girl's father, who we had just

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:90%
had dinner with.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And he found her a
house within two days.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: And you call this--

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.918 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: That's
a divine setup.

00:15:09.918 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: OK, a divine setup.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, and speaking
of depression again,

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
some of the work that
you do with your tapes

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is, for example, healing
depression the natural way.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.978 align:middle line:84%
And you said, your
son is a doctor.

00:15:19.978 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But he supports the work
that you have done here.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.853 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: He did on
that particular tape.

00:15:23.853 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:90%
I had him check it for accuracy.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And I had him listen to
my information side, which

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:84%
explains what
chronic depression is

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and how we all go through it.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And it also tells you that
when you are depressed enough

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you do
get medical help.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the second side
takes you back to being a baby

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and helps you to remember
the freedom of that

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
so that you can get
out of your depression.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Yes, the
freedom of being a baby.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Freedom
is interesting.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now, you also
teach meditation technique.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: I do.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I teach Kundalini yoga.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: OK, and
Kundalini yoga is--

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Is from a wonderful
master named Yogi Bhajan.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with breath work.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And it also has to
do with postures.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with clearing
the chakra's so that you can

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:84%
meditate deeper and relax
more, and then perhaps begin

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:84%
to get some inner
answers for yourself.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And the sanskrit
that's used-- sanskrit

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:84%
was believed to be the original
language like Om Namah Shivaya.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
You've heard of--

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.335 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Oh yes,
that is my chant.

00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: --Om Namah Shivaya?

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:90%
That's sanskrit.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So that when we hear it, we feel
joy and we feel a recognition.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So then we use seeds
sounds to clear the body.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you clear the body,
and everything relaxes, then

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.048 align:middle line:90%
your answers can come.

00:16:39.048 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Because
people always want

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to know from someone who is
an acknowledged psychic or

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyant how can they
become more intuitive,

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
more clarvoyant themselves.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And so you feel
that part of this

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.250 align:middle line:84%
is through the
meditation techniques.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:90%
What do you teach?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.955 align:middle line:84%
If people want to know how they
can become more intuitive--

00:16:56.955 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Well, I have--

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: --what
do you suggest?

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: --10
classes that I teach.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.570 align:middle line:90%
It's called psychic level one.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it
takes you through all

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
the different experiences--
the aura, the hands-on healing,

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:13.680 align:middle line:84%
the self-hypnosis, the
telepathy experience,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful regression
experience, and what karma is

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.560 align:middle line:90%
and how karma works.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you give them a
basic history of that.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
them, during this time,

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.500 align:middle line:84%
start to meditate and start
to work on being much more

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
aware of what their surroundings
are, what's going on

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.040 align:middle line:84%
with other people,
and that other people

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and how they act really do
not reflect on who you are.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.220 align:middle line:90%
It frees them up.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And then they can become wiser.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And they can start to
help others around them.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:90%
And we spread it.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: But as
you had said before,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
being overshadowed with
spiritual power, what this also

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
means is you have to be
responsible with your gifts.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Yes.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.335 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now
you said there was

00:17:56.335 --> 00:17:58.920 align:middle line:84%
an incident with your sister
that was really profound.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:90%
And this was your twin sister.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: In 1986 on November
11th, as a matter of fact,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:90%
I was meditating in Hawaii.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And I heard your sister died.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that a car
had gone over a hill.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And I call it put my hand
out into the fourth dimension

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and caught the car.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I literally would
not stop meditating

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.338 align:middle line:84%
until that car got safely
back up on the hill again.

00:18:20.338 --> 00:18:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And you said
it was a 10 hour process.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: It took 10 hours.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Oh, wow.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.467 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: 10 hours.

00:18:24.467 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
exhausted, and I slept.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And the next day I called
my mother 6,000 miles away.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And my identical twin had
gone over a 35 foot ravine

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
and had walked away from the
car accident without a scratch.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And there is
no doubt in your mind

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
the experience that you
had was saving the sister.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ELIZABETH: Absolutely.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: That's just
absolutely what happened.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: It was called
taking on the karma.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I took on the karma of my twin.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.323 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: And what
does that mean?

00:18:52.323 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: When you take
on the karma of somebody,

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:84%
it means that you help
them free themselves up

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
so they can make a
sole choice, especially

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:90%
if there's a lot of fear.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Another example, a friend
of mine, who is a healer,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.430 align:middle line:84%
had me come to the
hospital and work

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.930 align:middle line:90%
with his four-year-old daughter.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:90%
And we both worked on her.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:90%
She was ill.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.005 align:middle line:84%
And they could not find
what the problem was.

00:19:12.005 --> 00:19:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't really want
to know what the problem was.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to get rid of it.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So we both did a healing on
her with light and energy work

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:90%
based on--

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I would compare it to Barbara
Brennan's wonderful work.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And the next day she had
a 98 degree temperature

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and went home, and
was fine ever since.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we can
have a disturbance

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:90%
on the mental, emotional levels.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And we aren't able
to verbalize it.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It can affect our body,
throw us off of center.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And if we know how
to free that up,

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
then we can both have healing
practitioners with us.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Or we can self heal.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: Now, I did
visit your website.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And you do lots of
wonderful things.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:90%
You have essential oils.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.040 align:middle line:84%
You make your own jewelry
that you sell and so forth.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:84%
But I liked one of
the things that said,

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:90%
this is what we need to do.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are steps that
we can take to be happy

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and to have a good day.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
We need to sing, smile, dance,
stretch, and be outrageous.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ELIZABETH:
Absolutely outrageous.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.410 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGIA: Now tell me
a little bit about that.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:10%
You said-- the singing part--

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.118 align:middle line:10%
I mean, all of these things
really do work, don't they?

00:20:12.118 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I just
thought about it.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:90%
I thought, I should say more.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:90%
I smile a lot.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I love to dance.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:90%
It's natural to stretch.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.325 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we
need to just release.

00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:84%
But what about that
be outrageous part?

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: Well,
there's a couple

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.742 align:middle line:90%
of things I can tell you.

00:20:24.742 --> 00:20:26.158 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I
want to tell you

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:27.610 align:middle line:84%
is that when I
worked in aviation,

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I worked at Teterboro
for about seven years.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.068 align:middle line:84%
And a pilot would
come in and say, hey,

00:20:32.068 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
you want to fly to
Atlanta for dinner

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
and then to Connecticut
for dessert?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:90%
I would say absolutely.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Or, if you wanted
the job interview,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're afraid
to call for it,

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
or you're hesitant in
your own self esteem,

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
you can be outrageous,
and go for it.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never
written a screenplay,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.517 align:middle line:90%
sit down and write one.

00:20:49.517 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
You never know what's
going to happen.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:90%
You'll certainly learn.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.368 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: So just go for it.

00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: But the other way
to apply it is with soulmates.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:84%
You can create the entrance
of your soul mate if you want.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:90%
As a matter of fact, I did that.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I danced.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I played all of my love songs.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I like Perry Como and Nat
King Cole, and that's my era.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And I would dance around
the house with my soul mate

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
until I literally felt the
body, the outline of the body

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.498 align:middle line:90%
as I was dancing.

00:21:16.498 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was going to
meet a man that was five foot

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
10 or 11, had blue
eyes, and brownish hair,

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.087 align:middle line:84%
and that he was born
in Wichita, Kansas.

00:21:23.087 --> 00:21:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I was going to
spend New Year's Eve with him.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:26.665 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it Thanksgiving.

00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: I love it.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: And
it all happened.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GEORGIA: For those people
who haven't met their soul

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
mates, just dance with them
until they materialize.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ELIZABETH: They sit and
they worry about can I go here

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:37.230 align:middle line:90%
and can I go there?

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But you can call it
into your reality.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Deepak teaches this.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.195 align:middle line:84%
And once it's in your reality
system, it has to manifest.

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GEORGIA: Thank you.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:90%
What a delight.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Hasn't she been fun.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:84%
If you would like to be in
touch with Elizabeth Joyce,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:90%
stay tuned.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.088 align:middle line:90%
We'll let you know how.

00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And you know we always
love to hear from you.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.187 align:middle line:90%
And then some closing words.

00:21:55.187 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So you have just met
Elizabeth Joyce-- a woman

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.600 align:middle line:90%
with the gift of knowledge.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.285 align:middle line:84%
And as she acknowledged for
you, you have these gifts, too.

00:22:37.285 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I love the part that
you can just dance

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:90%
until the soulmate appears.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I love that part.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have a soul mate.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But for those of you who
still need to connect,

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that's another
opportunity of how

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
you can learn to live in balance
in mind, body, and spirit.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
May you be well,
happy, and peaceful,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps, you could sing, you
could dance, you could stretch,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:90%
you could be outrageous.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
