00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and I want to welcome you
to "Living in Balance."

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
with a man today who

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.930 align:middle line:90%
is a researcher after truth.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
talking about prophecy.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
looking to the sky.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the name of this
show is "Signs in the Sky."

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.685 align:middle line:90%

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
The author, Adrian Gilbert,
is sharing with us today

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom that he has gained
over the years of research

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:90%
that he has done.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You have probably heard of
his million-selling "Orion

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Mystery."

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.128 align:middle line:84%
And today we're
going to be talking

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:84%
about all of the information
that he has gathered

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.770 align:middle line:90%
from "Signs in the Sky."

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:10%
That is the name of the
book, and it is research

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:10%
that he has done
about the prophecies.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:10%
And so I want to
welcome Adrian Gilbert.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you do?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.610 align:middle line:10%
>> It's wonderful
to have you here.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're all the
way from the UK.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're here in America
to tell us more about--

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
as I said, a
researcher for truth

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:90%
is how you describe yourself.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And I like that because you
really have done your homework.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:10%
That is what you do.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's hard work
as well, I can tell you.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And you write books about it.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And they're really very,
very good selling books.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, most of them have
been best-selling, in top 10,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:90%
you know, in the UK, so yes.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And here too.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We've-- the prophecy,
though, is the subject.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Prophecy.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>> And I said,
you're not a prophet.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:10%
And you said, no,
but I have read

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.195 align:middle line:10%
about the history of the
different civilizations

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:10%
and the work they're doing.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So this "Signs in the
Sky" is timely now

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.543 align:middle line:84%
because we're at the end of
some ages, according to--

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's right.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.715 align:middle line:84%
You see, people have heard
this term, "Age of Aquarius."

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, the dawning
of the Age of Aquarius.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We've had this with us for
30 years or more, haven't we?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.840 align:middle line:10%
But nobody really
has got a handle on,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:10%
when does this actually start?

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.480 align:middle line:10%
What does it really mean?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:10%
What does it really signify?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
been my research work

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
over the past at least 20
years, looking for the signs,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.943 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand the
prophecies in the Bible

00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as in other
places in the world,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the
Mayan prophecies,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and to understand what those
things mean for us today.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but we've come to
a point that you're calling

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:90%
the opening of a stargate.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that means that this is
a point in time that has been

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.170 align:middle line:90%
prophesized?

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I got the term
"stargate" from ancient Egypt.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They had a belief that
over the hand of Orion--

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll be talking more
about Orion shortly--

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.460 align:middle line:84%
over the hand of
Orion, there was

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:84%
a sort of gateway in the
sky through which souls

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:90%
could come and go.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.257 align:middle line:84%
And this I found
to be absolutely

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:90%
at the root of everything.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.225 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and this was
ancient Egyptians.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> This was ancient
Egyptian, always, yes.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So stargate, then, is their
terminology for that place

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
where our souls can enter.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>> They describe it.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
They actually have a
picture of a little man

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:90%
holding a star in his hand.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:10%
But that Egyptian star
has a double meaning.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:10%
It means star as a hieroglyph,
but that hieroglyph also

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:10%
means gateway.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:10%
So he is actually holding
the stargate in his hand.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the best-selling
book that you co-authored,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
"The Orion Mystery,"
this was about--

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:90%
and tell us about Orion.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:10%
In "The Orion Mystery," which
I'm sure many of your viewers

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:10%
will have read, we put
forth the then-novel theory

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:10%
that the pyramids of
Egypt, the major pyramids

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:10%
of the Fourth
Dynasty, were built

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:10%
to represent the
stars of Orion, which

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:10%
is that brilliant constellation
in the sky that you see.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Like a great big man there,
holding a club, with his belt,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
with three big
stars in his belt.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, we put forward the theory
that the stars of Orion's belt

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:10%
were symbolized by
the pyramids of Giza.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:10%
And that wasn't just
an empty thought.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
It was actually my co-author,
Robert Bauval, who coined this.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:10%
And it was because
we knew that there

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:10%
were shafts running from that--

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:10%
from the Great Pyramid, which
is one of those star pyramids,

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:10%
pointing directly
at the position

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:10%
Orion's belt crossed in the sky.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:84%
As it went across from the east,
across the south to the west,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.260 align:middle line:90%
it crossed that shaft.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are also texts
called pyramid texts

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
in some of the
later pyramids which

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
tell us how the pharaoh
wants to go to the stars.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to become
a star of Orion.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So we began to see how this
whole thing worked together.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And we knew also that
the Orion constellation

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
was considered to be
connected with Osiris,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:90%
the god of the dead.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it was his star form.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So the pharaoh was
going to join Osiris.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:10%
He was going to become one with
Osiris in the sky with Orion.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So we could see a whole
pattern forming here.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, as you
did this research,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and you said you spent
20 years with it,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
do you find it just
absolutely fascinating?

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It gets deeper and deeper.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's taken over
my life, to be honest.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, you know, we
wonder about these ancient

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, which they seem
to have been so civilized,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and they almost seem to
have disappeared in a sense.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And are these ages, then,
that ended with them?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is
interesting you say this,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:84%
because I see these pyramids,
these relics from the past

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
as being put there to pass
a message onwards, knowing.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
That the people
who built them knew

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
there was going to
be periods of chaos.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And so they coded these things
for us later generations

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:90%
to read.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
They made them huge so
they would last the time.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:90%
So size is very important.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And they have.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And we--

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> They have, yeah.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Very intriguing, because
there are different theories

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:43.313 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
But I think you said
one of your co-authors

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
had done research for, again,
almost a lifetime dedicated

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.800 align:middle line:90%
to this type of research too.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So it does fascinate
us, does it not?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I mean, totally.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I meet so
many people who

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
come to me with different
theories about the pyramids,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
how they were built, why.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything from
alien spacecraft landing

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.932 align:middle line:84%
strips to water pumps
to I don't know what.

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
People have all sorts of
theories about the pyramids.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, speaking
of pyramids too,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.610 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about
the Egyptian pyramids,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
but what about the connection
to the Mayan pyramids too?

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Because people
wonder about that.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.425 align:middle line:84%
And are they not
of the same era?

00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Mayan
pyramids, of course,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:90%
are built very much later.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's the same kind of
feeling about them in a way.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
People built these
magnificent monuments

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:84%
as part and parcel
of their religion.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not just tombs
for dead ancestors.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.060 align:middle line:84%
They are so living
buildings that

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
are part and parcel of the
people's religious life

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
at the time they were
built. And they're connected

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.990 align:middle line:90%
with the stars as well.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what I
was going to say.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
They're always
connected with a time

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:84%
of the year, a perfect
flow of energy,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
like the serpent
at Chichen Itza.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.765 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that, where the
shadow serpent comes down

00:06:53.765 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:90%
the balustrade.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But also they're connected--
the ones in Mesoamerica--

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
with the Pleiades
constellation and the positions

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:90%
of the Pleiades in the sky.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So people have the same kind
of feeling about the stars

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.185 align:middle line:84%
and using stars to
measure our time.

00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> But from your perspective--

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you are studying
ancient prophecy,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:90%
and you're trying to find--

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.198 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
interpret it for us now.

00:07:17.198 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are time frames
that we're looking at.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
The millennium, of
course, is the Christian.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.640 align:middle line:90%
But there's also the 2012.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that the Mayan?

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mayan calendar supposedly
will end at the winter solstice

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.800 align:middle line:90%
in 2012.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very important,
and it brings me back

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:90%
to this thing about stargates.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.820 align:middle line:90%
You see, in the ancient world--

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to apply right
through the world, East

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and West--

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
there is a conception
that there are

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
two points in the sky
where there are gateways,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:90%
where souls could come and go.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And these points corresponded
with the position

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.110 align:middle line:90%
where the ecliptic--

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
that's the imaginary
line that the sun

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:84%
follows through the zodiac as
it goes round through the year.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
The two places where the
ecliptic crosses over the Milky

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.313 align:middle line:84%
Way-- so you have
this band of stars,

00:08:06.313 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the Milky Way, and the
ecliptic crossing over.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.023 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
point of that--

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
there's one in the north
and one in the south.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.790 align:middle line:84%
The two positions it
crosses were the stargates.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of these stargates
is over the hand of Orion.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.463 align:middle line:90%
He's sort of reaching up to it.

00:08:22.463 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I say when the
star is sitting in his hand,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:10%
he's reaching up
to the stargate.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:10%
The other one is over the tail
of Scorpio and in Sagittarius.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the sun will
be at that point,

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
at that stargate at the winter
solstice in 2012, the very day

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.819 align:middle line:84%
when the calendar finishes--
the Mayan calendar.

00:08:44.819 --> 00:08:46.305 align:middle line:84%
>> But now, the
important thing--

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:50.158 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I asked
you before we went on air.

00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not saying
the world is coming

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:90%
to an end with these things.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't believe so.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I certainly hope so--

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.800 align:middle line:90%
hope not.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's going to
symbolize the next stage

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.140 align:middle line:90%
in our evolution of mankind.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
symbolize awakening up

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
to who we really
are, which is spirits

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:90%
living in physical bodies.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Are we-- for the most part,
we're not conscious of this.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:84%
We think of ourselves as
just being clever animals.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't see us that way.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I see our body as having
evolved from the animal kingdom.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.147 align:middle line:84%
But what truly makes us human
is being something else.

00:09:23.147 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:90%
We call it the soul.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Call it the spirit,
what you like,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.680 align:middle line:84%
it's that divine spark in
us that makes us different.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have found, then,
from the work that you have

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.690 align:middle line:84%
done, all this
research and so forth,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're very comfortable
with the idea that in ancient

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:84%
times they knew that this would
be that point in time when that

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:84%
shift in consciousness
would come.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you see,
the ancient times,

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:84%
the people's religion was guided
by what they call a hermetic

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
principle--

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.100 align:middle line:90%
as above, so below.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
keyed into the idea

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening
in the heavens is

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:90%
mirrored on the ground.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:10%
But they were also
into another idea

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.140 align:middle line:10%
in their philosophy,
their self development,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:10%
which was a type
of yoga where they

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:10%
sought to connect themselves
with what they call a higher

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:10%
mind.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And those who were
so connected had

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.130 align:middle line:84%
what they called the
gnosis, the knowledge.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole basis
of the Egyptian mysticism,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to become like
Hermes, the first man

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to have achieved that
level of initiation,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.467 align:middle line:84%
to have been joined
with the higher mind.

00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they all sought.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And those who were
would have been

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
guided by the higher mind, which
you could call the mind of God.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So it might not be
that they consciously

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:84%
understood these things,
but through the subconscious

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.900 align:middle line:90%
they were able to work with it.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And time seems to have not
been of any problem in this.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so we have
this knowledge, then,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:10%
from those who connected
with the higher self,

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.625 align:middle line:10%
connected with the mind
of God, for example.

00:10:52.625 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.545 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've looked a
little bit at Egypt.

00:10:55.545 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We've looked just a
little bit at the Mayans.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:10%
We're going to take a break,
and when we come back,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:10%
we're going to go to both the
biblical prophecy, Jerusalem,

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Mesopotamia.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Because in every
civilization, there

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
is a point where there is a
ship that comes, is there not?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:10%
>> And you have put this
together for us very well,

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:10%
so we do appreciate.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] And what we like
to do is take a break,

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:10%
and when we come
back, Adrian Gilbert

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:10%
will share with us more of
the information from "Signs

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:10%
in the Sky," and also this
concept of the stargate.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll stay tuned,
we will be right back.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you are just joining
us, I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and the subject is prophecy.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:10%
And we are looking at a
book, "Signs in the Sky,"

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:10%
by Adrian Gilbert.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:10%
He is a prolific author who has
done great amount of research

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:10%
in the field.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we wanted
to clarify, "Signs in the Sky"

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
is not a book about
astrology and horoscope,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
but it is about
astronomy, astrology.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:10%
Because it is the
signs in the sky are

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:10%
what are definitive to
give us a time frame?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:10%
It's where you're looking at
the stars and the positions

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.610 align:middle line:10%
of the sun and moon
and so forth as forming

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:10%
a kind of clock face,
clicking out the years,

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.140 align:middle line:10%
clicking out the
centuries, the millennia.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's nothing
to do with what you

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:90%
would call popular astrology.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.623 align:middle line:84%
But we are going to
talk about prophecy,

00:12:24.623 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:90%
is what we're talking about.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to go
to the biblical prophecy,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.637 align:middle line:84%
because we have looked
at the Egyptians.

00:12:29.637 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:90%
We have looked at the Mayans.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And now what about the
Judeo-Christian approach?

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is very,
very exciting.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- it was new ground
for me when I went to Jerusalem

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years ago, and
the penny first dropped that

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of the--

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
of man in the sky,
Orion, is actually

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:90%
to be interpreted as Adam.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Adam in the sky.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.280 align:middle line:84%
In the Judeo-Christian
tradition, they have something

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.365 align:middle line:84%
called Kabbalah, the early sort
of the secret form of Judaism.

00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's the mystical
aspect of the Hebrew tradition.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The mystical
aspect of Judaism.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And they talk about the
figure of the Adam Kadmon,

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:90%
the first man.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And they describe him
as composed of lights,

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.257 align:middle line:90%
of spheres of light.

00:13:13.257 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly realized
that what they were really

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:90%
talking about is Orion.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:10%
And it's the movements of Orion
over the thousands of years

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:10%
which map out time.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And if I could just
explain that for a moment.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, uh-huh.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of-- the Earth has
several different motions.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It goes around daily,
giving us day and night.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It goes around the sun,
giving us the year.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But it also has a
slight wobbling motion,

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.210 align:middle line:84%
like a top running
down, which gives

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
us what's called a
procession of the equinoxes.

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And what that means,
put very simply,

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
is that the pole of the
Earth is kind of doing

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:90%
a little circle in the sky.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But it takes 26,000 years
to make one complete circle.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very slow movement.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the effect of that is to
make the constellations move

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
relative in the sky,
how high they rise to

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and how low they set,
over periods of time.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, interestingly,
around about 10,800 BC,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:84%
the Orion constellation was at
its lowest point in the sky.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant
was that the stargate--

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you-- above his
hand, was at its lowest point.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And the sun would sit there
at the winter solstice

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:10%
on the shortest day of the year.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:10%
Ever since then, it's been
drifting further north.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:10%
And this has had some very
interesting consequences.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The belt of Orion is
now right underneath

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.430 align:middle line:84%
the celestial equator,
which is the sky

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.475 align:middle line:90%
equivalent of our equator.

00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And it would never
actually cross

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
that before it starts
going down again.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.422 align:middle line:90%
But at Jerusalem--

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.214 align:middle line:84%
I hope this isn't sort
of confusing to you.

00:14:52.214 --> 00:14:53.014 align:middle line:90%
>> That's OK.

00:14:53.014 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> At Jerusalem, if you were
standing on where the temple

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
is, or was, looking eastwards,
you would now see the belt

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:84%
of Orion rising over
the Mount of Olives,

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:84%
which is where Jesus ascended to
Heaven from, or so we're told.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, you do
have in your book--

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.455 align:middle line:10%
and there is a picture of
the Orion over Jerusalem.

00:15:11.455 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly it.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And maybe we can
get a close-up of that.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:10%
>> There you can see the
Church of the Ascension with

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.910 align:middle line:10%
Orion's belt rising above it--

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.933 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:10%
>> --on the Mount of Olives.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:10%
And you said it was the summer
solstice of the year 2000

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:10%
is very significant.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.683 align:middle line:84%
>> It's especially significant
for various reasons.

00:15:30.683 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there
is a great gathering

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:35.560 align:middle line:84%
of the planets happening
in the year 2000.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.930 align:middle line:84%
In May, 2000, they
would be together,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:84%
about the 4th of May,
all seven of the planets

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.540 align:middle line:84%
of the ancients, which
includes the sun and moon.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And then on the 21st of June,
which is the summer solstice,

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:84%
the sun would be over the hand
of Orion at that stargate,

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:54.503 align:middle line:90%
with the other planets nearby.

00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now, what does
that mean, though,

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that stargate at
that exact position?

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that when souls
would come and go?

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> This seems to be the belief.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the
Book of Revelations,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it tells us how St. John has a
vision of this angelic being.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The first and the last,
he calls itself, the Alpha

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.280 align:middle line:90%
and the Omega.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And he describes
this angelic being.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:90%
He wears a belt.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
His face glows like the
sun at its strength.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sun is at its
strength at the summer solstice.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.720 align:middle line:84%
He holds seven
stars in his hand.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the stars or the planets
pass over the hand of Orion.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And later on, he's described
as standing amidst the seven

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
candlesticks, which
are the seven stars--

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
the sun and moon, Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:90%
and Saturn.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have this
description of this very day.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Aha.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And so your research has brought
you to that interpretation.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And Revelations
has been attempted

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:84%
to be interpreted by many,
but this would make sense.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And from your research,
this has clarity for you.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So this, then, would
be a very special time,

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:90%
the summer solstice of 2000.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.453 align:middle line:84%
And for another
reason, for Christians

00:17:03.453 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
it's especially interesting.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I sort of
was very interested

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:90%
about the life of Jesus.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:12.309 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's possible
to work out the exact days

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:14.680 align:middle line:90%
that certain things happened.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
We know that the baptism
happened in 26 AD.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.740 align:middle line:84%
We can pretty well work
out pretty certainly

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
that the crucifixion
took place in 29 AD.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Last Supper
was the Feast

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.110 align:middle line:84%
of the Passover, which took
place at the first full moon

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:90%
after the equinox.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.522 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
know these details,

00:17:31.522 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:90%
but I'm just telling you.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:84%
From that, we can work out
where the sun was on that day.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Then on Easter Sunday,
the first Easter.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And I did this.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I counted on 40 days
to when the ascension should

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:90%
take place.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:90%
And do you know what?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
The sun was right over the
hand of Orion on that day.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Aha.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And he says he's going to
the right hand of his father.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And the sun, symbolically, is
over the right hand of Orion.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
These things seem too much
to be a coincidence to me.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So your research takes
you to that point.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.913 align:middle line:90%
>> Takes me to that.

00:18:01.913 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So Orion is very
important in all of this.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.135 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be this great
symbol of man in the sky.

00:18:07.135 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:10%
>> There is another
place we need to go back,

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.780 align:middle line:10%
and that's to Mesopotamia.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, what did you
gather in your information

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.690 align:middle line:84%
when you went farther
back, then, to Mesopotamia?

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.458 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was very interested in
the whole story of the three

00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:84%
wise men, the three
kings, which turns up

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the Gospels.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
ask yourself, why

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is there a story about pagan
wise men coming to Bethlehem?

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And why has that been
put in the Bible?

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:10%
And I started researching
what I could find out

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:10%
about the people who lived
in that area of Mesopotamia

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:10%
at the time of Jesus
and just before.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:10%
And I found there were some
very interesting remains

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:10%
in a place called Commagene,
which is now southeast Turkey,

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:10%
by the river Euphrates.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And I found there was an
enormously deep shaft there

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.120 align:middle line:84%
at a place that a king
had built as a shrine

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.065 align:middle line:90%
for his dead father.

00:19:01.065 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knew what
the shaft was for.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:90%
It's 158 meters long.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.272 align:middle line:90%
It's angled at 35 degrees.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And I took a compass
with me, and I found

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.690 align:middle line:90%
it was pointing exactly west.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that
there should be

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:10%
two days in the year when
the sun should shine down

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.638 align:middle line:10%
that shaft, exactly a
ray, down to the bottom.

00:19:20.638 --> 00:19:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And someone could be
standing at the bottom

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, it's
the right day.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:10%
And from the inscriptions
above this shaft,

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.915 align:middle line:10%
it tells us it was there
for the birthday of the king

00:19:32.915 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:10%
and also for his dead father.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
one day corresponded

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:84%
when the sun was in Leo, next
to a especially bright star

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.370 align:middle line:90%
called Regulus, the king star.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And the other day it
was pointing exactly

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:84%
again at this stargate
over the hand of Orion.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, we had the
same idea coming out.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.770 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I want you now to
tell us again for now,

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:10%
for us, what about this?

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:84%
What should we know,
and what should we

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
be awakening to, aware of, or
what should we be prepared for?

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, I understand that these
ancient peoples understood

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:10%
and knew things about
time and about the sky

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:10%
and about the position of man
on Earth that we've forgotten.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But they coded some
of this information

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:90%
into their monuments.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.185 align:middle line:84%
And it's down to us
now, using our computers

00:20:24.185 --> 00:20:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and our other means to decode
these monuments to see,

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:90%
to refine this knowledge.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
What it's pointing
at, to my mind,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we're coming to the end
of a great 13,000-year period.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
There's been other 13,000-year
periods before that,

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
but each period marks a major
change in the development

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:90%
of mankind.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're coming up to
another major change, which

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.710 align:middle line:84%
might be on the level of the
beginnings of written script,

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Something really
major like that which

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
will take us to the next
stage in our evolution

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:90%
as a species on Earth.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:10%
And I hope it's going
to involve the opening

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:10%
up of our clairvoyance,
development of our higher

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.290 align:middle line:10%
powers, our higher knowledge,
and our remembrance of who

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:10%
we really are, which is
what seems to be so lacking

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:10%
in our modern world.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of how I see it.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I like
that, I really do.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know, some people
think of these changes

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and the end of these ages as
being a doomsday kind of thing.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But I love that-- your approach
to it, that it is an awakening.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:10%
And how wonderful
if we remember--

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I hope so.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --those gifts we have.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If things happen,
well, they happen.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But you can do
nothing about that.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:10%
But what you can do
is about yourself

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and your attitude towards
life and your attitude

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:10%
towards the universe
in which we live.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.273 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
try to approach it.

00:21:45.273 --> 00:21:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>> We appreciate that.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.665 align:middle line:84%

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
You have taken this journey with
us today, Adrian Gilbert and I,

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
and gone back.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And we've looked at the
Mayans and the Egyptians

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:90%
in biblical times, Mesopotamia.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I think the
best thing that he has said

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a
shift in consciousness.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It's coming.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It is a time where we can
awaken to who we really are,

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.030 align:middle line:90%
spiritual beings--

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and I love that part--

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.540 align:middle line:84%
with our own intuitive
remembrances too.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Our clairvoyance
can be awakened.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, I'm
Georgia Shakti-Hill.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
May you be well,
happy, and peaceful.
