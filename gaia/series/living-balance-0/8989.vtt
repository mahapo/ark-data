00:00:02.352 --> 00:00:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Georgia Shakti-Hill,
and I want to welcome you

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.940 align:middle line:90%
to "Living in Balance."

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.090 align:middle line:84%
In our cultural series, we
have talked to many people

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.740 align:middle line:84%
from many different
walks of life.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And today we will meet a man
who walks the medicine path.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
He is Irish, and he is Cherokee,
and he is a storyteller.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And you will enjoy
this adventure today

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.210 align:middle line:90%
with Soaring Eagle.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.002 align:middle line:90%
Come join us.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.948 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
For years, there
is a man who has

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:90%
come into Southwest Florida.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And when he does, he
always shares with us.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first
time you, as the audience,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
are going to get to
meet Soaring Eagle.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:90%
As I said, he is a storyteller.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:84%
He is a man who walks
the medicine path.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:90%
He is Irish and he is Cherokee.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And we are very pleased
to have him with us today.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:90%
So, welcome.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Georgia.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be back.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But, as usual, I
have to give thanks

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the people that
live in the state of Florida,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
especially the Native American
people and the Miccosukee

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and the Seminole.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to let them know
that I'm honored to be here.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And they let me
do what I do here.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So because it's our land, so
I'd like to pay tribute to them.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's a tradition that
you have done every program

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:90%
that we have shared together.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it's honoring
the people, because you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:90%
are in their territory.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the Native American,
we still have all those

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.300 align:middle line:84%
territories of all
the different tribes.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's very important.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.192 align:middle line:84%
Because in this day and
time, especially, there's

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
so much road rage, and this,
and that, and the other,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that it's really nice for
people to show honor and give

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
thanks to other people for
being able to be in their area.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you are
a traditional man.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you have been
trained, and as I said,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.370 align:middle line:90%
you walk the medicine path.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And your heritage is it your
grandfather, who is Cherokee,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
taught you the old ways.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I try to carry on--
it's my responsibility

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:84%
to carry on the culture
and the medicines,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.530 align:middle line:84%
also, that he taught
me about, and the trees

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and the plants and the
things we use for medicine.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So I try very hard
to keep up with that,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and carry it on, and
teach it to others, also,

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:90%
so that it doesn't die.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.695 align:middle line:84%
And later in the
show we're going

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:90%
to meet your female apprentice.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
You have someone you know is
in training, and that you are--

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm really proud.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So in our second segment,
we'll meet Patty.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:90%
That'll be great.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And you and your wife travel.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And part of this journey that
you're on takes you to powwows.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And those are celebrations.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.987 align:middle line:90%
>> And they're social.

00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:50.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're always
sacred moments.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>> This is true.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
that the songs that are

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
sang and the dances are danced,
for the most part, a good 80%

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to 90% of them are
a form of prayer,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
giving thanks to the creator
or god or grandfather

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.770 align:middle line:84%
for the Earth, for Mother Earth,
and the plants, and the trees,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and for safe journey, and
for the food they eat,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and just many different things.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of the people,
it's a traditional time, too,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.505 align:middle line:90%
and a gathering of the people.

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:21.305 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Renewal of old friends
and making new friends,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and
sharing the food.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's really a nice time.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it
gives us a chance

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
to make all of our things,
our rattles and our war clubs

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and our fans and
different things,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and share with other people
about some of the things

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:90%
that we make.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have brought
some of the beautiful gifts.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's you and your
wife who travel together.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of
the things that you make.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And this one is--

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
you just told me about what
this is about, and what--

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
the parts to it.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about this.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:84%
What do I have in
front of me, here?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a deer antler that
we've used for the handle.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
This happens to be a
piece of wolf, here.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:90%
And these are turkey feathers.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
the turkey was

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:90%
a sacred bird for our people.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it was always
there for food.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So not just eagle feathers, and
hawk, and so forth are sacred,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
so is the turkey feathers
for the Cherokee people.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So I try to use the proper
materials in the things,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:84%
also, as long as they're
legal for people to use.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.120 align:middle line:90%
But we use these--

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I make these single ones
for people to smudge with.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Because we use the sage and
the sage bowl for purification

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
and we burn it.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's to fan the smoke
onto the people or items,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.582 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of negativity.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And the smudging is very
important because that is

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:90%
a sacred ritual.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very effective
as far as, as you said,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:90%
removing the negativities.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just had a friend who
said that she was so pleased.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
The man with whom she is
involved had a restaurant.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
the restaurants before

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.640 align:middle line:90%
had not done well.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And so, because he was
open to it, they came in

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
and they did a smudging ceremony
before the restaurant opened.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And he has done very well.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I believe that because
we do it with our things.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Once we put our
things out, we smudge.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If somebody walks by that
I have a feeling that--

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel that they are negative
person, I do it again.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Because people don't realize
that we carry an energy

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.840 align:middle line:90%
that can go from you to me.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
It can get off a
person that's negative

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:90%
and get on your things.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And other people that
feel those energies

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.580 align:middle line:84%
will walk around your place
where you have your things.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.175 align:middle line:90%
So it's necessary to cleanse it.

00:05:37.175 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, it's
an interesting thing.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the Native
Americans- this

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
is what I love about
all their cultures.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
The aura is how it is
described in English.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And then your shakti,
which is my name,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.003 align:middle line:84%
is like, the vibration
that you give off.

00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So with a Native
American, they're

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.545 align:middle line:90%
just very much aware of it.

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
just more in tune.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
many of us are trying

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.130 align:middle line:84%
to do is try very hard to raise
people's awareness about things

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:90%
around them.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I know even in the military,
that some of the men

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:90%
chose to follow me.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was in special forces,
and around the world nine times

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:90%
in nine years.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And we smell, and
taste, and hear,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and feel a lot of things
that other people don't.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Not because they can't, but
because they don't practice it.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the creator
or god made us all so

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:90%
we can do these things.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've said before,
too, one of the best parts

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
of the powwow, which I
really do appreciate,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is how they always
honor the warriors,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.360 align:middle line:84%
which are warriors today are
people from the military who

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:90%
have served.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's really
a nice tradition.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the Native
Americans have served.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very
important for veterans

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:90%
that are Native American.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when we have a
powwow, we have what's

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:90%
called a grand entry.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And when the drums
are playing and they

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
have honor songs for
veterans, and so forth,

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
the veterans themselves--

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.310 align:middle line:84%
the Native American veterans
carry the colors in.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's very important.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They go before everybody,
and then the head man

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.522 align:middle line:84%
dancer, and head woman
dancer, and then elders,

00:07:11.522 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But all the veterans
go first and they

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.930 align:middle line:84%
carry the flags and the
colors and post them.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's very important.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, we
have a song that's

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
equal to our flag song that's
very important for us to do.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.742 align:middle line:90%
So we do the flag song.

00:07:26.742 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we
leave the circle,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.460 align:middle line:90%
we do the honoring song.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And all the veterans
and anybody else

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that's not-- don't even have
regalia on that's a veteran,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
can follow them out and
get in and dance with them.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's honoring the warriors
and the veterans of all people,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:90%
whether Native American or not.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to us at the powwows.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the beautiful gifts
that you've made here, too,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:90%
this is a warrior's--

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:90%
the hammer.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the war club.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>> The war club.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You can call it a
hammer, if you want to.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> This stone come from
the creek that runs through

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the reservation up in
Cherokee, North Carolina.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And, by the way,
don't go picking up

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
those stones in there
unless you do have a card,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and you're Native American.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll come
and get you for it.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And the handle is wood, and
it's split soaked and water,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and then wrapped while you
can bend it around the stone.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:90%
But there's no glue in it.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's very sturdy.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we wrap the
hand with leather.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I had a talking stick, and
I was explaining to a lady

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:90%
how this worked.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.692 align:middle line:84%
And she just got off
the plane from England

00:08:32.692 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:90%
at the Miccosukee village.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, my
husband would get that.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
And I would never get it back.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's the
reason you need a war club,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.820 align:middle line:84%
so you can get your
talking stick back.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.326 align:middle line:90%
>> To go with the talking stick.

00:08:42.326 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.081 align:middle line:84%
>> And I love the tradition
of the talking stick.

00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.433 align:middle line:84%
And we've adapted that in my
life because it seems to work.

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
everybody takes a turn.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.715 align:middle line:84%
>> And you pass, as the
walking stick goes around--

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
the talking stick goes around.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I sold all my talking sticks.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And this is actually a pie.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, anything that
can be used as a talking

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
stick-- because our
people, they used

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
a talking stick whenever
they gather together

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:90%
to make decisions.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And they can make
decisions because they

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
wasn't interrupted.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.173 align:middle line:84%
Because if you interrupted
and spoke out of turn

00:09:15.173 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have
the talking stick,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.250 align:middle line:84%
a couple of large warriors
would come and lead you out

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:90%
very quietly.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And you wasn't allowed
to come back and be

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
a part of the decision
making until the elders felt

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.430 align:middle line:84%
like that you had
learned patience.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.313 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's very important.

00:09:29.313 --> 00:09:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Nobody speaks unless they're
holding the talking stick.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.657 align:middle line:84%
And you say what you've
got to say and pass it

00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:90%
on to the next person.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things
I wanted to do is,

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
because you do a
lot of healing work,

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
there are two recipes
that I have taken--

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I took an herb class that was
given by one of our herbalists

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.030 align:middle line:90%
in Southwest Florida.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But two, three sheets
of the materials

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:90%
were Soaring Eagle's recipes.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.078 align:middle line:84%
So we have two recipes
from you that we're

00:09:55.078 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:90%
going to share with the people.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> One of them is
your health tonic.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is just an
overall, good for everybody,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:84%
but you said especially
good for high blood pressure

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.648 align:middle line:84%
and for people who
are not feeling well.

00:10:08.648 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It's just good cleansing.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's one with
apple cider vinegar.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.365 align:middle line:90%
That's for arthritis, too.

00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:14.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Arthritis?

00:10:14.165 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And blood pressure.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize it done so
good with the blood pressure

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
until I gave a lady the
recipe and she took it

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and her husband
started taking it.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And come to find out, he
had high blood pressure.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And when he went in, his blood
pressure was all the way down.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even have to take
his medication anymore.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, one of the other things,
too, is one of your recipes.

00:10:31.822 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It's easy, and I like it, and
it's kind of old fashioned.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's the cough syrup.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's simple.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it's real simple.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:10%
But you use the lemons.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
You can use any number
of lemons you want.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:90%
But I usually use two lemons.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:10%
And I slice them very
thin and put them

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:10%
in about two cups of water.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:10%
This can vary, too.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And you just kind of simmer
that until it kind of evaporates

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:10%
to about half the liquid.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.360 align:middle line:10%
And then you mash up the
lemons, and strain it out.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And whatever liquid
you have there,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:10%
then you put an equal
amount of honey with it,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:10%
and it's very good.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to really
put a little bite to it,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
you can put some ground
cayenne pepper in it.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's very healing, that is.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that is.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> But a lot of people
can't stand the heat.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.660 align:middle line:90%
But that does add a--

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.627 align:middle line:90%
>> --little healing element.

00:11:23.627 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only that, the cayenne
pepper is very high in vitamin

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:90%
C, also.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going
to take a break.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:29.957 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back,
we have lots more

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:32.907 align:middle line:84%
to talk about-- a couple
of my favorite books that

00:11:32.907 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
give us a little background
information on the Cherokee.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.198 align:middle line:90%
And we will meet Patty.

00:11:36.198 --> 00:11:36.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you will stay tuned, we
will be right back with Soaring

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Eagle.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.523 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're just joining
us, we're talking

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to a man who walks
the medicine path.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:84%
He is a healer in the tradition
of the storyteller, too.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:90%
And he is Irish and Cherokee.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:90%
And that is, Soaring Eagle.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of the gifts that
Soaring Eagle has shared

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
with people in the
Southeast here,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.320 align:middle line:84%
from Florida all the way up the
coast, is the Moon Ceremony.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And he has with
him, his apprentice.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're happy
to have Patty Hit.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.898 align:middle line:90%
So welcome to you.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to have
you with us, Patty.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me here.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] And we're
going to do some drumming.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about this Moon Ceremony

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
special and sacred event.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And tell us a
little bit about it,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and then the role that
Patty has with it.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Moon Ceremony is
something that the Cherokee

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
people have held pretty
traditionally down through

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:33.670 align:middle line:90%
the years.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
But my grandfather
taught me how to do it.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's basically held between
the new moon and the full moon.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:90%
And we gather together and--

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to give thanks to
the creator or god--

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
same god that everybody
else has, believe it or not,

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
for putting the moon up there.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it was used as a
guide to fish and hunt,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
plant seeds, and do
many different things.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:10%
And it was a time to cleanse
and get rid of your negativity,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:10%
and instead of just
letting it stack up

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:10%
like people do nowadays.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So every 28 days, we
get rid of whatever.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And the ashes from the fire was
gifted to me by my grandfather.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Our people used
to carry the fire.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
They had a special woven
thing, double weaved basket,

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.352 align:middle line:84%
which is typical of Cherokee,
with a cauldron in it.

00:13:23.352 --> 00:13:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And every time they would move
from one place to the other,

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:84%
they'd take the fire and
put it in the cauldron

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.088 align:middle line:90%
and carry it with them.

00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's how fire got to be
so old, because it was carried.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a couple
books that I love--

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
"The Cherokees
Past and Present,"

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and I think we have a
couple shots of these.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And, also, "Voices
of the Ancestors."

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:10%
And the people who like to do
some reading about the seven

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:10%
clans and about the
traditions, a very simple book

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:10%
is "The Cherokees
Past and Present."

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have one
that really goes deeply

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:84%
into all these traditions
that you're talking about.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's "Voices
of our Ancestors."

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And you had mentioned,
these are quite good, too.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason I'd like
to see that book--

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:10%
because so many of the
things that I was taught

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:10%
is reflected in this
book, and, after the fact

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:10%
really, of my teaching.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's written
by Dhyani Ywahoo.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of the different
tribes, they had societies.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And Dhyani Ywahoo is a 27th
generation Ywahoo society.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Evidently, her grandmother
has allowed her to do this.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> To share.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.618 align:middle line:84%
>> She got permission from her
grandmother to share and put

00:14:35.618 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%
this in the form of a book.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's an old society.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Patty, you are
learning the traditions.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And you have become an
apprentice to Soaring Eagle.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me about dedicating
your life to that.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I kind of got
here in a strange way,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of like, I felt
like I was led to do this.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
To me, following the
Native American path

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
has made the creator whole
and very active in my life,

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that when I'm walking down
the road and I see a hawk,

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a bird
anymore that looks pretty.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe the
messenger, that maybe I

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
need to think about
when I was just thinking

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
or pay attention
for a few minutes.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And maybe an answer
will be there.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And it just made everything
seem whole and lively.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, it
was something that I

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
chose to follow, and to learn
more and to do more with,

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:90%
and to work with the people.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I first met you
in that class on herbs.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, at that
time, you were doing

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.892 align:middle line:90%
some singing and some chanting.

00:15:38.892 --> 00:15:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, you brought the drum.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And tell me, did you
paint the drum or as--

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I did.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's the artist?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.712 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to show that to us?

00:15:44.712 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:90%
If we could-- maybe this camera?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:90%
That's excellent.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And so everything
here is symbolic.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.317 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have been named--

00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Running Water is
your Indian name.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.250 align:middle line:84%
A very powerful name,
you said, Soaring Eagle.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.003 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:00.003 --> 00:16:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to play the
drum for us a little bit?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And tell us about
the drum and --

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the drum is
a very sacred thing.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a drum
that I made myself.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I sweat, and cried, and pulled,
and yanked, and let dry myself.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And it represents the
heartbeat of Mother Earth.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.540 align:middle line:84%
It represents the heartbeat
that we all feel when

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.860 align:middle line:90%
or we're in our mother's wombs.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.585 align:middle line:84%
And so, right now
with all the things

00:16:27.585 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that are going on
in the world, I

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.625 align:middle line:84%
wanted to sing a song about
being gentle with ourselves.

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Because a lot of
times, we forget that.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.535 align:middle line:84%
We forget to love
ourselves, be gentle,

00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and then we forget
that we really

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
are part of the
great circle of life.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm going to sing
a little song here.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.866 align:middle line:90%
[DRUM BEATING]

00:16:46.866 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) I will
be gentle with myself.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.250 align:middle line:90%
I will love myself.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.930 align:middle line:90%
I am a child of the universe.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.599 align:middle line:90%
We are one together.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I will be gentle with myself.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.345 align:middle line:90%
I will love myself.

00:17:19.345 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I am a child of the universe.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.659 align:middle line:90%
We are one together.

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Hee.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.805 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have been
doing the Moon Ceremony.

00:17:38.805 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
But, because you
travel so much, you've

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:84%
given some
responsibilities, then,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:90%
to Patty when you are away.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- there's
so much ritual to it,

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot to learn.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Like you said, the ashes came.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so then you always carry
the ashes to the other,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But there's the corn, and so
there's a whole ritual to it.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:90%
But everything's symbolic.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:90%
When the people come there--

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
see, we have 28 days in a
moon, 28 days and a moon,

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:90%
13 times in one year.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.607 align:middle line:84%
So we really gather
together there

00:18:09.607 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
so people can get rid of their
negativity, and so forth.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So we do all the
saging, full body sages

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of the negativity.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
We hand out cornmeal, so
they can take that cornmeal

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's used as a
tool or a vehicle

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to instill all their negativity,
and all the harsh words

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and things that's happened
to him in the past 28 days.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And we take that back up,
and we take it to the fire

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of it in the fire.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's a physical thing
we do with these hurts,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.795 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:18:37.795 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%
And then we do the prayers.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And we pray to the same
god that everybody else,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.305 align:middle line:84%
even an organized
religion, prays to.

00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
they said about in the religion

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality
of the Cherokee--

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
because they do believe
Great Spirit, the one god,

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that it was very easy for
them to also incorporate

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.755 align:middle line:90%
Christianity.

00:18:56.755 --> 00:18:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
legend that you've

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.890 align:middle line:84%
shared with me before as
a storyteller, of someone

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:90%
who walked the lands.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you know, when the
first missionaries came over

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:10%
here they started talking
to some of our elders.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And through drawing pictures
in the dirt and sign language

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and a little of this
and a little of that,

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:90%
they managed to communicate.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:10%
And, come to find
out, our elders

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:10%
were telling them
stories that lined up

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:10%
with stories in the Bible,
right down to the 23rd Psalms.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
But we also feel like
that sometime between--

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
whenever we were
made and put here,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
God gave us our
instructions to live by,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
which we're equal to the
Ten Commandments, basically.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And so some time
between the crucifixion

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and the Resurrection of Christ
or [CHEROKEE] in the Cherokee

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
language, we found out that
he walked the Americas,

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and come around and said, my
father, when he created you,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.462 align:middle line:84%
gave you these
instructions to live by.

00:19:54.462 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And you're drifting
away from them,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.128 align:middle line:90%
so you got to get back to it.

00:19:57.128 --> 00:19:58.336 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] So get back with it.

00:19:58.336 --> 00:20:00.336 align:middle line:84%
>> So actually, yeah,
there is the legend, then,

00:20:00.336 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus walked the
lands of the Cherokee.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:90%
Jesus walked the Americas.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> He walked the Americas.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you have
blended the worlds.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And, like you said,
you are registered.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
You have your card and
you are a Cherokee.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But you really have
walked in both worlds.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
But now it really
feels right to you

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.670 align:middle line:84%
to really dedicate
all of your time to--

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:90%
you do classes.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You go from center to
center, and you share

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%
the herbs and the healing.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:84%
What is the message
that you're wanting

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to share with people most?

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what I want to share
most is awareness and survival.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I think those two words
pretty well cover everything.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear things, and we
feel things, and we see things,

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and we smell things, we taste
things in the air that other

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:90%
people don't.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's not because they can't.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.092 align:middle line:84%
It's just because they
don't stop to do it.

00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't practice it.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Like Patty with
the hawk, for example.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's true.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Paying attention to nature
and things around you--

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
example of the hawk.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Patty don't see a bird
anymore as just a pretty bird.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.930 align:middle line:90%
There's a message in that.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.263 align:middle line:84%
There's a message and
things that happen.

00:21:07.263 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I know when South America had
an earthquake here a while back,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
the first one they had, and
I had terrible headaches.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And I even had a dream
about it two days

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:90%
before it ever happened.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:84%
There's many things that happens
that way, that you just--

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:90%
you really can't explain it.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.192 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
in society today,

00:21:27.192 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:84%
with science and
everything, everything's

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.320 align:middle line:90%
got to be scientific.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:84%
If you can't see it or feel
it or taste it or smell it,

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:90%
it's not--

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.565 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't exist.

00:21:34.565 --> 00:21:35.448 align:middle line:90%
That isn't true.

00:21:35.448 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, it's
really fascinating.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad we have so
many things that you've shared.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And people can be in touch
with you because you have tapes

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:90%
and you have videos.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So, as I said, you
are the modern man

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:90%
who walks the medicine path.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And, Patty, it was really
wonderful to have you with us.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you would like to be
in touch with Soaring Eagle,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
stay tuned.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.448 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let you
know how you can.

00:21:57.448 --> 00:21:59.476 align:middle line:84%
And, also, we would
love to hear from you.

00:22:02.452 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I love it when
Soaring Eagle comes.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.140 align:middle line:90%
The time just flies by.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:90%
He has many stories to tell.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But his heart is so good, and he
has such a wonderful intention

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
to share the wisdom
and the light

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
of his people, the Cherokee.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And we are so pleased that
Patty was with us, also.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And I am always pleased
that you are there.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, may you be
well, happy and peaceful.
